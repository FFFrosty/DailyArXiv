| **[Querying Labeled Time Series Data with Scenario Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10627v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation-based testing has become a crucial complement to road testing for ensuring the safety of cyber physical systems (CPS). As a result, significant research efforts have been directed toward identifying failure scenarios within simulation environments. However, a critical question remains. Are the AV failure scenarios discovered in simulation reproducible on actual systems in the real world? The sim-to-real gap caused by differences between simulated and real sensor data means that failure scenarios identified in simulation might either be artifacts of synthetic sensor data or actual issues that also occur with real sensor data. To address this, an effective approach to validating simulated failure scenarios is to locate occurrences of these scenarios within real-world datasets and verify whether the failure persists on the datasets. To this end, we introduce a formal definition of how labeled time series sensor data can match an abstract scenario, represented as a scenario program using the Scenic probabilistic programming language. We present a querying algorithm that, given a scenario program and a labeled dataset, identifies the subset of data that matches the specified scenario. Our experiment shows that our algorithm is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster in querying scenarios than the state-of-the-art commercial vision large language models, and can scale with the duration of queried time series data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weak Relation Enforcement for Kinematic-Informed Long-Term Stock Prediction with Artificial Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10494v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose loss function week enforcement of the velocity relations between time-series points in the Kinematic-Informed artificial Neural Networks (KINN) for long-term stock prediction. Problems of the series volatility, Out-of-Distribution (OOD) test data, and outliers in training data are addressed by (Artificial Neural Networks) ANN's learning not only future points prediction but also by learning velocity relations between the points, such a way as avoiding unrealistic spurious predictions. The presented loss function penalizes not only errors between predictions and supervised label data, but also errors between the next point prediction and the previous point plus velocity prediction. The loss function is tested on the multiple popular and exotic AR ANN architectures, and around fifteen years of Dow Jones function demonstrated statistically meaningful improvement across the normalization-sensitive activation functions prone to spurious behaviour in the OOD data conditions. Results show that such architecture addresses the issue of the normalization in the auto-regressive models that break the data topology by weakly enforcing the data neighbourhood proximity (relation) preservation during the ANN transformation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuum Dropout for Neural Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10446v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Differential Equations (NDEs) excel at modeling continuous-time dynamics, effectively handling challenges such as irregular observations, missing values, and noise. Despite their advantages, NDEs face a fundamental challenge in adopting dropout, a cornerstone of deep learning regularization, making them susceptible to overfitting. To address this research gap, we introduce Continuum Dropout, a universally applicable regularization technique for NDEs built upon the theory of alternating renewal processes. Continuum Dropout formulates the on-off mechanism of dropout as a stochastic process that alternates between active (evolution) and inactive (paused) states in continuous time. This provides a principled approach to prevent overfitting and enhance the generalization capabilities of NDEs. Moreover, Continuum Dropout offers a structured framework to quantify predictive uncertainty via Monte Carlo sampling at test time. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Continuum Dropout outperforms existing regularization methods for NDEs, achieving superior performance on various time series and image classification tasks. It also yields better-calibrated and more trustworthy probability estimates, highlighting its effectiveness for uncertainty-aware modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking Dynamic Inter-Client Spatial Dependencies: A Federated Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning Method for Traffic Flow Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10434v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal graphs are powerful tools for modeling complex dependencies in traffic time series. However, the distributed nature of real-world traffic data across multiple stakeholders poses significant challenges in modeling and reconstructing inter-client spatial dependencies while adhering to data locality constraints. Existing methods primarily address static dependencies, overlooking their dynamic nature and resulting in suboptimal performance. In response, we propose Federated Spatio-Temporal Graph with Dynamic Inter-Client Dependencies (FedSTGD), a framework designed to model and reconstruct dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies in federated learning. FedSTGD incorporates a federated nonlinear computation decomposition module to approximate complex graph operations. This is complemented by a graph node embedding augmentation module, which alleviates performance degradation arising from the decomposition. These modules are coordinated through a client-server collective learning protocol, which decomposes dynamic inter-client spatial dependency learning tasks into lightweight, parallelizable subtasks. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedSTGD achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, approaching that of centralized baselines. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each module in addressing dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies, while sensitivity analysis highlights the robustness of FedSTGD to variations in hyperparameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChronoGraph: A Real-World Graph-Based Multivariate Time Series Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04449v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present ChronoGraph, a graph-structured multivariate time series forecasting dataset built from real-world production microservices. Each node is a service that emits a multivariate stream of system-level performance metrics, capturing CPU, memory, and network usage patterns, while directed edges encode dependencies between services. The primary task is forecasting future values of these signals at the service level. In addition, ChronoGraph provides expert-annotated incident windows as anomaly labels, enabling evaluation of anomaly detection methods and assessment of forecast robustness during operational disruptions. Compared to existing benchmarks from industrial control systems or traffic and air-quality domains, ChronoGraph uniquely combines (i) multivariate time series, (ii) an explicit, machine-readable dependency graph, and (iii) anomaly labels aligned with real incidents. We report baseline results spanning forecasting models, pretrained time-series foundation models, and standard anomaly detectors. ChronoGraph offers a realistic benchmark for studying structure-aware forecasting and incident-aware evaluation in microservice systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fault Detection in Solar Thermal Systems using Probabilistic Reconstructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10296v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solar thermal systems (STS) present a promising avenue for low-carbon heat generation, with a well-running system providing heat at minimal cost and carbon emissions. However, STS can exhibit faults due to improper installation, maintenance, or operation, often resulting in a substantial reduction in efficiency or even damage to the system. As monitoring at the individual level is economically prohibitive for small-scale systems, automated monitoring and fault detection should be used to address such issues. Recent advances in data-driven anomaly detection, particularly in time series analysis, offer a cost-effective solution by leveraging existing sensors to identify abnormal system states. Here, we propose a probabilistic reconstruction-based framework for anomaly detection. We evaluate our method on the publicly available PaSTS dataset of operational domestic STS, which features real-world complexities and diverse fault types. Our experiments show that reconstruction-based methods can detect faults in domestic STS both qualitatively and quantitatively, while generalizing to previously unseen systems. We also demonstrate that our model outperforms both simple and more complex deep learning baselines. Additionally, we show that heteroscedastic uncertainty estimation is essential to fault detection performance. Finally, we discuss the engineering overhead required to unlock these improvements and make a case for simple deep learning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prediction of linear fractional stable motions using codifference, with application to non-Gaussian rough volatility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15437v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The linear fractional stable motion (LFSM) extends the fractional Brownian motion (fBm) by considering $α$-stable increments. We propose a method to forecast future increments of the LFSM from past discrete-time observations, using the conditional expectation when $α>1$ or a semimetric projection otherwise. It relies on the codifference, which describes the serial dependence of the process, instead of the covariance. Indeed, covariance is commonly used for predicting an fBm but it is infinite when $α<2$. Some theoretical properties of the method and of its accuracy are studied and both a simulation study and an application to real data confirm the relevance of the approach. The LFSM-based method outperforms the fBm, when forecasting high-frequency FX rates. It also shows a promising performance in the forecast of time series of volatilities, decomposing properly, in the fractal dynamic of rough volatilities, the contribution of the kurtosis of the increments and the contribution of their serial dependence. Moreover, the analysis of hit ratios suggests that, beside independence, persistence, and antipersistence, a fourth regime of serial dependence exists for fractional processes, characterized by a selective memory controlled by a few large increments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond MSE: Ordinal Cross-Entropy for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10200v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is an important task that involves analyzing temporal dependencies and underlying patterns (such as trends, cyclicality, and seasonality) in historical data to predict future values or trends. Current deep learning-based forecasting models primarily employ Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss functions for regression modeling. Despite enabling direct value prediction, this method offers no uncertainty estimation and exhibits poor outlier robustness. To address these limitations, we propose OCE-TS, a novel ordinal classification approach for time series forecasting that replaces MSE with Ordinal Cross-Entropy (OCE) loss, preserving prediction order while quantifying uncertainty through probability output. Specifically, OCE-TS begins by discretizing observed values into ordered intervals and deriving their probabilities via a parametric distribution as supervision signals. Using a simple linear model, we then predict probability distributions for each timestep. The OCE loss is computed between the cumulative distributions of predicted and ground-truth probabilities, explicitly preserving ordinal relationships among forecasted values. Through theoretical analysis using influence functions, we establish that cross-entropy (CE) loss exhibits superior stability and outlier robustness compared to MSE loss. Empirically, we compared OCE-TS with five baseline models-Autoformer, DLinear, iTransformer, TimeXer, and TimeBridge-on seven public time series datasets. Using MSE and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as evaluation metrics, the results demonstrate that OCE-TS consistently outperforms benchmark models. The code will be published.</p></details> |  |
| **[DenoGrad: Deep Gradient Denoising Framework for Enhancing the Performance of Interpretable AI Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10161v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of Machine Learning (ML) models, particularly those operating within the Interpretable Artificial Intelligence (Interpretable AI) framework, is significantly affected by the presence of noise in both training and production data. Denoising has therefore become a critical preprocessing step, typically categorized into instance removal and instance correction techniques. However, existing correction approaches often degrade performance or oversimplify the problem by altering the original data distribution. This leads to unrealistic scenarios and biased models, which is particularly problematic in contexts where interpretable AI models are employed, as their interpretability depends on the fidelity of the underlying data patterns. In this paper, we argue that defining noise independently of the solution may be ineffective, as its nature can vary significantly across tasks and datasets. Using a task-specific high quality solution as a reference can provide a more precise and adaptable noise definition. To this end, we propose DenoGrad, a novel Gradient-based instance Denoiser framework that leverages gradients from an accurate Deep Learning (DL) model trained on the target data -- regardless of the specific task -- to detect and adjust noisy samples. Unlike conventional approaches, DenoGrad dynamically corrects noisy instances, preserving problem's data distribution, and improving AI models robustness. DenoGrad is validated on both tabular and time series datasets under various noise settings against the state-of-the-art. DenoGrad outperforms existing denoising strategies, enhancing the performance of interpretable IA models while standing out as the only high quality approach that preserves the original data distribution.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Estimation of Climate Normals and Anomalies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05071v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quantification of the interannual component of variability in climatological time series is essential for the assessment and prediction of the El Niño - Southern Oscillation phenomenon. This is achieved by estimating the deviation of a climate variable (e.g., temperature, pressure, precipitation, or wind strength) from its normal conditions, defined by its baseline level and seasonal patterns. Climate normals are currently estimated by simple arithmetic averages calculated over the most recent 30-year period ending in a year divisible by 10. The suitability of the standard methodology has been questioned in the context of a changing climate, characterized by nonstationary conditions. The literature has focused on the choice of the bandwidth and the ability to account for trends induced by climate change. The paper contributes to the literature by proposing a regularized real time filter based on local trigonometric regression, optimizing the estimation bias-variance trade-off in the presence of climate change, and by introducing a class of seasonal kernels enhancing the localization of the estimates of climate normals. Application to sea surface temperature series in the Niño 3.4 region and zonal and trade winds strength in the equatorial and tropical Pacific region, illustrates the relevance of our proposal.</p></details> |  |
| **[RI-Loss: A Learnable Residual-Informed Loss for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10130v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting relies on predicting future values from historical data, yet most state-of-the-art approaches-including transformer and multilayer perceptron-based models-optimize using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which has two fundamental weaknesses: its point-wise error computation fails to capture temporal relationships, and it does not account for inherent noise in the data. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Residual-Informed Loss (RI-Loss), a novel objective function based on the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). RI-Loss explicitly models noise structure by enforcing dependence between the residual sequence and a random time series, enabling more robust, noise-aware representations. Theoretically, we derive the first non-asymptotic HSIC bound with explicit double-sample complexity terms, achieving optimal convergence rates through Bernstein-type concentration inequalities and Rademacher complexity analysis. This provides rigorous guarantees for RI-Loss optimization while precisely quantifying kernel space interactions. Empirically, experiments across eight real-world benchmarks and five leading forecasting models demonstrate improvements in predictive performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Code will be made publicly available to ensure reproducibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intilligence Foundation Model: A New Perspective to Approach Artificial General Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10119v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new perspective for approaching artificial general intelligence (AGI) through an intelligence foundation model (IFM). Unlike existing foundation models (FMs), which specialize in pattern learning within specific domains such as language, vision, or time series, IFM aims to acquire the underlying mechanisms of intelligence by learning directly from diverse intelligent behaviors. Vision, language, and other cognitive abilities are manifestations of intelligent behavior; learning from this broad range of behaviors enables the system to internalize the general principles of intelligence. Based on the fact that intelligent behaviors emerge from the collective dynamics of biological neural systems, IFM consists of two core components: a novel network architecture, termed the state neural network, which captures neuron-like dynamic processes, and a new learning objective, neuron output prediction, which trains the system to predict neuronal outputs from collective dynamics. The state neural network emulates the temporal dynamics of biological neurons, allowing the system to store, integrate, and process information over time, while the neuron output prediction objective provides a unified computational principle for learning these structural dynamics from intelligent behaviors. Together, these innovations establish a biologically grounded and computationally scalable foundation for building systems capable of generalization, reasoning, and adaptive learning across domains, representing a step toward truly AGI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information Capacity: Evaluating the Efficiency of Large Language Models via Text Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08066v3)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs) and their expanding applications, leading to soaring demands for computational resources. The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further aggravates the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations. We assess the information capacity of 49 models on 5 heterogeneous datasets and observe consistent results on the influences of tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and the mixture-of-experts architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/TeleAI-AI-Flow/InformationCapacity.

| **[Enhancing Time Series Forecasting through Selective Representation Spaces: A Patch Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14510v3)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Forecasting has made significant progress with the help of Patching technique, which partitions time series into multiple patches to effectively retain contextual semantic information into a representation space beneficial for modeling long-term dependencies. However, conventional patching partitions a time series into adjacent patches, which causes a fixed representation space, thus resulting in insufficiently expressful representations. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of constructing a selective representation space to flexibly include the most informative patches for forecasting. Specifically, we propose the Selective Representation Space (SRS) module, which utilizes the learnable Selective Patching and Dynamic Reassembly techniques to adaptively select and shuffle the patches from the contextual time series, aiming at fully exploiting the information of contextual time series to enhance the forecasting performance of patch-based models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SRS module, we propose a simple yet effective SRSNet consisting of SRS and an MLP head, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets from multiple domains. Furthermore, as a novel plugin-and-play module, SRS can also enhance the performance of existing patch-based models. The resources are available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/SRSNet.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Non-Stationary Time Series Forecasting with Temporal Stabilization and Frequency Differencing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08229v3)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is critical for decision-making across dynamic domains such as energy, finance, transportation, and cloud computing. However, real-world time series often exhibit non-stationarity, including temporal distribution shifts and spectral variability, which pose significant challenges for long-term time series forecasting. In this paper, we propose DTAF, a dual-branch framework that addresses non-stationarity in both the temporal and frequency domains. For the temporal domain, the Temporal Stabilizing Fusion (TFS) module employs a non-stationary mix of experts (MOE) filter to disentangle and suppress temporal non-stationary patterns while preserving long-term dependencies. For the frequency domain, the Frequency Wave Modeling (FWM) module applies frequency differencing to dynamically highlight components with significant spectral shifts. By fusing the complementary outputs of TFS and FWM, DTAF generates robust forecasts that adapt to both temporal and frequency domain non-stationarity. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DTAF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding significant improvements in forecasting accuracy under non-stationary conditions. All codes are available at https://github.com/PandaJunk/DTAF.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[MDMLP-EIA: Multi-domain Dynamic MLPs with Energy Invariant Attention for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09924v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is essential across diverse domains. While MLP-based methods have gained attention for achieving Transformer-comparable performance with fewer parameters and better robustness, they face critical limitations including loss of weak seasonal signals, capacity constraints in weight-sharing MLPs, and insufficient channel fusion in channel-independent strategies. To address these challenges, we propose MDMLP-EIA (Multi-domain Dynamic MLPs with Energy Invariant Attention) with three key innovations. First, we develop an adaptive fused dual-domain seasonal MLP that categorizes seasonal signals into strong and weak components. It employs an adaptive zero-initialized channel fusion strategy to minimize noise interference while effectively integrating predictions. Second, we introduce an energy invariant attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on different feature channels within trend and seasonal predictions across time steps. This mechanism maintains constant total signal energy to align with the decomposition-prediction-reconstruction framework and enhance robustness against disturbances. Third, we propose a dynamic capacity adjustment mechanism for channel-independent MLPs. This mechanism scales neuron count with the square root of channel count, ensuring sufficient capacity as channels increase. Extensive experiments across nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that MDMLP-EIA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[CaReTS: A Multi-Task Framework Unifying Classification and Regression for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09789v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep forecasting models have achieved remarkable performance, yet most approaches still struggle to provide both accurate predictions and interpretable insights into temporal dynamics. This paper proposes CaReTS, a novel multi-task learning framework that combines classification and regression tasks for multi-step time series forecasting problems. The framework adopts a dual-stream architecture, where a classification branch learns the stepwise trend into the future, while a regression branch estimates the corresponding deviations from the latest observation of the target variable. The dual-stream design provides more interpretable predictions by disentangling macro-level trends from micro-level deviations in the target variable. To enable effective learning in output prediction, deviation estimation, and trend classification, we design a multi-task loss with uncertainty-aware weighting to adaptively balance the contribution of each task. Furthermore, four variants (CaReTS1--4) are instantiated under this framework to incorporate mainstream temporal modelling encoders, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and Transformers. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that CaReTS outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms in forecasting accuracy, while achieving higher trend classification performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Koopman Invariants as Drivers of Emergent Time-Series Clustering in Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09783v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), a powerful class of self-supervised models, exhibit an unexplained ability to cluster time-series data by their underlying dynamical regimes. We propose a novel theoretical explanation for this phenomenon, hypothesizing that JEPA's predictive objective implicitly drives it to learn the invariant subspace of the system's Koopman operator. We prove that an idealized JEPA loss is minimized when the encoder represents the system's regime indicator functions, which are Koopman eigenfunctions. This theory was validated on synthetic data with known dynamics, demonstrating that constraining the JEPA's linear predictor to be a near-identity operator is the key inductive bias that forces the encoder to learn these invariants. We further discuss that this constraint is critical for selecting this interpretable solution from a class of mathematically equivalent but entangled optima, revealing the predictor's role in representation disentanglement. This work demystifies a key behavior of JEPAs, provides a principled connection between modern self-supervised learning and dynamical systems theory, and informs the design of more robust and interpretable time-series models.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[xLSTMAD: A Powerful xLSTM-based Method for Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22837v2)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently proposed xLSTM is a powerful model that leverages expressive multiplicative gating and residual connections, providing the temporal capacity needed for long-horizon forecasting and representation learning. This architecture has demonstrated success in time series forecasting, lossless compression, and even large-scale language modeling tasks, where its linear memory footprint and fast inference make it a viable alternative to Transformers. Despite its growing popularity, no prior work has explored xLSTM for anomaly detection. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing xLSTMAD, the first anomaly detection method that integrates a full encoder-decoder xLSTM architecture, purpose-built for multivariate time series data. Our encoder processes input sequences to capture historical context, while the decoder is devised in two separate variants of the method. In the forecasting approach, the decoder iteratively generates forecasted future values xLSTMAD-F, while the reconstruction approach reconstructs the input time series from its encoded counterpart xLSTMAD-R. We investigate the performance of two loss functions: Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Soft Dynamic Time Warping (SoftDTW) to consider local reconstruction fidelity and global sequence alignment, respectively. We evaluate our method on the comprehensive TSB-AD-M benchmark, which spans 17 real-world datasets, using state-of-the-art challenging metrics such as VUS-PR. In our results, xLSTM showcases state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming 23 popular anomaly detection baselines. Our paper is the first work revealing the powerful modeling capabilities of xLSTM for anomaly detection, paving the way for exciting new developments on this subject. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Nyderx/xlstmad</p></details> |  |
| **[Cooperative Local Differential Privacy: Securing Time Series Data in Distributed Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09696v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of smart devices such as phones, wearables, IoT sensors, and connected vehicles has led to an explosion of continuous time series data that offers valuable insights in healthcare, transportation, and more. However, this surge raises significant privacy concerns, as sensitive patterns can reveal personal details. While traditional differential privacy (DP) relies on trusted servers, local differential privacy (LDP) enables users to perturb their own data. However, traditional LDP methods perturb time series data by adding user-specific noise but exhibit vulnerabilities. For instance, noise applied within fixed time windows can be canceled during aggregation (e.g., averaging), enabling adversaries to infer individual statistics over time, thereby eroding privacy guarantees. To address these issues, we introduce a Cooperative Local Differential Privacy (CLDP) mechanism that enhances privacy by distributing noise vectors across multiple users. In our approach, noise is collaboratively generated and assigned so that when all users' perturbed data is aggregated, the noise cancels out preserving overall statistical properties while protecting individual privacy. This cooperative strategy not only counters vulnerabilities inherent in time-window-based methods but also scales effectively for large, real-time datasets, striking a better balance between data utility and privacy in multiuser environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Local Interaction Autoregressive Model for High Dimension Time Series Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09542v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional matrix and tensor time series often exhibit local dependency, where each entry interacts mainly with a small neighborhood. Accounting for local interactions in a prediction model can greatly reduce the dimensionality of the parameter space, leading to more efficient inference and more accurate predictions. We propose a Local Interaction Autoregressive (LIAR) framework and study Separable LIAR, a variant with shared row and column components, for high-dimensional matrix/tensor time series forecasting problems. We derive a scalable parameter estimation algorithm via parallel least squares with a BIC-type neighborhood selector. Theoretically, we show consistency of neighborhood selection and derive error bounds for kernel and auto-covariance estimation. Numerical simulations show that the BIC selector recovers the true neighborhood with high success rates, the LIAR achieves small estimation errors, and the forecasts outperform matrix time-series baselines. In real data applications, a Total Electron Content (TEC) case study shows the model can identify localized spatio-temporal propagation and improved prediction as compared with non-local time series prediction models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Chi-Square Method beats Discrete Fourier Transform and other similar parametric time series analysis methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01540v3)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We compare two time series analysis methods, the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and our Discrete Chi-square Method (DCM). DCM is designed for detecting signal(-s) superimposed on an unknown trend. The analytical solution for the non-linear DCM model is an ill-posed problem. We present a computational statistical well-posed solution for this problem. The backbone of DCM is the Gauss-Markov theorem that the least squares fit is the best unbiased estimator for linear regression models. DCM can not fail because this simple time series analysis method computes a massive number of linear least squares fits. Hence, the data spacing, even or uneven, is irrelevant. We use the Fisher-test to identify the best DCM model from all alternative tested DCM models. This best model must also pass our Predictivity-test. Our analyses of simulated complex data sets expose the weaknesses of DFT and the efficiency of DCM. The DFT and DCM are frequency-domain parametric methods. There are many other similar parametric methods. Just like DFT, those other methods suffer from their own particular application limitations. The list of those limitations is long. DCM suffers from none of those limitations. The performance of DCM depends only on the data set size and accuracy. DCM is an ideal forecasting method because the data set time span $(ΔT)$ is irrelevant. It does not matter how long $(ΔT)$ and/or complex the data set is because DCM will inevitably detect the signal(-s) and the trend when the data set size $(n)$ and/or accuracy $(σ)$ become adequate.</p></details> | 27 pages, 8 figures |
| **[BatteryLife: A Comprehensive Dataset and Benchmark for Battery Life Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18807v7)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Battery Life Prediction (BLP), which relies on time series data produced by battery degradation tests, is crucial for battery utilization, optimization, and production. Despite impressive advancements, this research area faces three key challenges. Firstly, the limited size of existing datasets impedes insights into modern battery life data. Secondly, most datasets are restricted to small-capacity lithium-ion batteries tested under a narrow range of diversity in labs, raising concerns about the generalizability of findings. Thirdly, inconsistent and limited benchmarks across studies obscure the effectiveness of baselines and leave it unclear if models popular in other time series fields are effective for BLP. To address these challenges, we propose BatteryLife, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for BLP. BatteryLife integrates 16 datasets, offering a 2.5 times sample size compared to the previous largest dataset, and provides the most diverse battery life resource with batteries from 8 formats, 59 chemical systems, 9 operating temperatures, and 421 charge/discharge protocols, including both laboratory and industrial tests. Notably, BatteryLife is the first to release battery life datasets of zinc-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and industry-tested large-capacity lithium-ion batteries. With the comprehensive dataset, we revisit the effectiveness of baselines popular in this and other time series fields. Furthermore, we propose CyclePatch, a plug-in technique that can be employed in various neural networks. Extensive benchmarking of 18 methods reveals that models popular in other time series fields can be unsuitable for BLP, and CyclePatch consistently improves model performance establishing state-of-the-art benchmarks. Moreover, BatteryLife evaluates model performance across aging conditions and domains.

Bayesian networks can be used to capture causal relationships. There, one recovers a weighted directed acyclic graph in which random variables are represented by vertices, and the weights associated with each edge represent the strengths of the causal relationships between them. This concept is extended to capture dynamic effects by introducing a dependency on past data, which may be captured by the structural equation model. This formalism is utilized in the present contribution to propose a score-based learning algorithm. A mixed-integer quadratic program is formulated and an algorithmic solution proposed, in which the pre-generation of exponentially many acyclicity constraints is avoided by utilizing the so-called branch-and-cut (``lazy constraint'') method. Comparing the novel approach to the state-of-the-art, we show that the proposed approach turns out to produce more accurate results when applied to small and medium-sized synthetic instances containing up to 80 time series. Lastly, two interesting applications in bioscience and finance, to which the method is directly applied, further stress the importance of developing highly accurate, globally convergent solvers that can handle instances of modest size.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at: https://github.com/pavelrt/ExDBN</p></details> |
| **[PATH: A Discrete-sequence Dataset for Evaluating Online Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Approaches for Multivariate Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13951v6)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmarking anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time series is a challenging task due to a lack of high-quality datasets. Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. Additionally, our dataset represents a discrete-sequence problem, which remains unaddressed by previously-proposed solutions in literature. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data. Furthermore, results show that the threshold used can have a large influence on detection performance, hence more work needs to be invested in methods to find a suitable threshold without the need for labelled data.</p></details> |  |
| **[TeVAE: A Variational Autoencoder Approach for Discrete Online Anomaly Detection in Variable-state Multivariate Time-series Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06849v2)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As attention to recorded data grows in the realm of automotive testing and manual evaluation reaches its limits, there is a growing need for automatic online anomaly detection. This real-world data is complex in many ways and requires the modelling of testee behaviour. To address this, we propose a temporal variational autoencoder (TeVAE) that can detect anomalies with minimal false positives when trained on unlabelled data. Our approach also avoids the bypass phenomenon and introduces a new method to remap individual windows to a continuous time series. Furthermore, we propose metrics to evaluate the detection delay and root-cause capability of our approach and present results from experiments on a real-world industrial data set. When properly configured, TeVAE flags anomalies only 6% of the time wrongly and detects 65% of anomalies present. It also has the potential to perform well with a smaller training and validation subset but requires a more sophisticated threshold estimation method.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedFuse: Multiplicative Embedding Fusion For Irregular Clinical Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09247v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs) are inherently irregular, with asynchronous sampling, missing values, and heterogeneous feature dynamics. While numerical laboratory measurements are highly informative, existing embedding strategies usually combine feature identity and value embeddings through additive operations, which constrains their ability to capture value-dependent feature interactions. We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks. Analysis of the learned representations further demonstrates that multiplicative fusion enhances expressiveness and supports cross-dataset pretraining. These results establish MedFuse as a generalizable approach for modeling irregular clinical time series.</p></details> |  |

Radiology reports are essential for clinical decision making, yet their manual creation is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recent advancements of vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential in medical applications, presenting a promising avenue for automating report generation. However, existing applications of VLMs in the medical domain have predominantly focused on structural imaging modalities, while the unique characteristics of molecular PET imaging have largely been overlooked. To bridge the gap, we introduce PET2Rep, a large-scale comprehensive benchmark for evaluation of general and medical VLMs for radiology report generation for PET images. PET2Rep stands out as the first dedicated dataset for PET report generation with metabolic information, uniquely capturing whole-body image-report pairs that cover dozens of organs to fill the critical gap in existing benchmarks and mirror real-world clinical comprehensiveness. In addition to widely recognized natural language generation metrics, we introduce a series of clinical efficacy metrics to evaluate the quality of radiotracer uptake pattern description in key organs in generated reports. We conduct a head-to-head comparison of 30 cutting-edge general-purpose and medical-specialized VLMs. The results show that the current state-of-the-art VLMs perform poorly on PET report generation task, falling considerably short of fulfilling practical needs. Moreover, we identify several key insufficiency that need to be addressed to advance the development in medical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Existing methods often model spatial and temporal dynamics independently and overlook causality-driven probabilistic forecasting, limiting their predictive power. To address this, we propose STOAT (Spatial-Temporal Probabilistic Causal Inference Network), a novel framework for probabilistic forecasting in STC-TS. The proposed method extends a causal inference approach by incorporating a spatial relation matrix that encodes interregional dependencies (e.g. proximity or connectivity), enabling spatially informed causal effect estimation. The resulting latent series are processed by deep probabilistic models to estimate the parameters of the distributions, enabling calibrated uncertainty modeling. We further explore multiple output distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Student's-$t$, Laplace) to capture region-specific variability. Experiments on COVID-19 data across six countries demonstrate that STOAT outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting models (DeepAR, DeepVAR, Deep State Space Model, etc.) in key metrics, particularly in regions with strong spatial dependencies. By bridging causal inference and geospatial probabilistic forecasting, STOAT offers a generalizable framework for complex spatial-temporal tasks, such as epidemic management.</p></details> |  |
| **[Repetitive Contrastive Learning Enhances Mamba's Selectivity in Time Series Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09185v2)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long sequence prediction is a key challenge in time series forecasting. While Mamba-based models have shown strong performance due to their sequence selection capabilities, they still struggle with insufficient focus on critical time steps and incomplete noise suppression, caused by limited selective abilities. To address this, we introduce Repetitive Contrastive Learning (RCL), a token-level contrastive pretraining framework aimed at enhancing Mamba's selective capabilities. RCL pretrains a single Mamba block to strengthen its selective abilities and then transfers these pretrained parameters to initialize Mamba blocks in various backbone models, improving their temporal prediction performance. RCL uses sequence augmentation with Gaussian noise and applies inter-sequence and intra-sequence contrastive learning to help the Mamba module prioritize information-rich time steps while ignoring noisy ones. Extensive experiments show that RCL consistently boosts the performance of backbone models, surpassing existing methods and achieving state-of-the-art results. Additionally, we propose two metrics to quantify Mamba's selective capabilities, providing theoretical, qualitative, and quantitative evidence for the improvements brought by RCL.</p></details> |  |

We propose an IV estimator that synthesizes instruments from the data. We establish finite-sample $L^{p}$ consistency for all $p \ge 1$ in both discrete- and continuous-time models, recovering a nonparametric $\sqrt{n}$-convergence rate. On a forced Lorenz system our estimator reduces parameter bias by 200x (continuous-time) and 500x (discrete-time) relative to least squares and reduces RMSE by up to tenfold. Because the method only assumes that the model is linear in the unknown parameters, it is broadly applicable to modern sparsity-promoting dynamics learning models.</p></details> |  |

Here, we propose BRIDGE, a data-reuse RCT design for AI-based risk models. AI risk models support a broad range of interventions, including screening, treatment selection, and clinical alerts. BRIDGE trials recycle participant-level data from completed trials of AI models when legacy and updated models make concordant predictions, thereby reducing the enrollment requirement for subsequent trials. We provide a practical checklist for investigators to assess whether reusing data from previous trials allows for valid causal inference and preserves type I error. Using real-world datasets across breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and sepsis, we demonstrate concordance between successive AI models, with up to 64.8% overlap in top 5% high-risk cohorts. We then simulate a series of breast cancer screening studies, where our design reduced required enrollment by 46.6%--saving over US$2.8 million--while maintaining 80% power. By transforming trials into adaptive, modular studies, our proposed design makes Level I evidence generation feasible for every model iteration, thereby accelerating cost-effective translation of AI into routine care.</p></details> |  |

For the first time, we investigate a large number of existing data-driven wildfire modeling strategies under controlled conditions, revealing the best modeling strategies and resulting in models that achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy for both single-day and multi-day input scenarios, as evaluated on a large public benchmark for next-day wildfire spread, termed the WildfireSpreadTS (WSTS) benchmark. Consistent with prior work, we found that models using time-series input obtained the best overall accuracy, suggesting this is an important future area of research. Furthermore, we create a new benchmark, WSTS+, by incorporating four additional years of historical wildfire data into the WSTS benchmark. Our benchmark doubles the number of unique years of historical data, expands its geographic scope, and, to our knowledge, represents the largest public benchmark for time-series-based wildfire spread prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, accepted at WACV 2026</p></details> |
| **[Trustworthy Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction via Pattern-Aware Interaction Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13397v3)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and reliable pedestrian trajectory prediction is critical for the application of intelligent applications, yet achieving trustworthy prediction remains highly challenging due to the complexity of interactions among pedestrians. Previous methods often adopt black-box modeling of pedestrian interactions. Despite their strong performance, such opaque modeling limits the reliability of predictions in real-world deployments. To address this issue, we propose InSyn (Interaction-Synchronization Network), a novel Transformer-based model that explicitly captures diverse interaction patterns (e.g., walking in sync or conflicting) while effectively modeling direction-sensitive social behaviors. Additionally, we introduce a training strategy, termed Seq-Start of Seq (SSOS), designed to alleviate the common issue of initial-step divergence in numerical time-series prediction. Experiments on the ETH and UCY datasets demonstrate that our model not only outperforms recent black-box baselines in prediction accuracy, especially under high-density scenarios, but also provides transparent interaction modeling, as shown in the case study. Furthermore, the SSOS strategy proves to be effective in improving sequential prediction performance, reducing the initial-step prediction error by approximately 6.58%.

| **[M3-Net: A Cost-Effective Graph-Free MLP-Based Model for Traffic Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08543v3)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving accurate traffic prediction is a fundamental but crucial task in the development of current intelligent transportation systems.Most of the mainstream methods that have made breakthroughs in traffic prediction rely on spatio-temporal graph neural networks, spatio-temporal attention mechanisms, etc. The main challenges of the existing deep learning approaches are that they either depend on a complete traffic network structure or require intricate model designs to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. These limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction performance and lightweight deployment.Our code is available at https://github.com/jinguangyin/M3_NET</p></details> |  |
| **[rfBLT: Random Feature Bayesian Lasso Takens Model for time series forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08957v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series prediction is challenging due to our limited understanding of the underlying dynamics. Conventional models such as ARIMA and Holt's linear trend model experience difficulty in identifying nonlinear patterns in time series. In contrast, machine learning models excel at learning complex patterns and handling high-dimensional data; however, they are unable to quantify the uncertainty associated with their predictions, as statistical models do. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose Random Feature Bayesian Lasso Takens (rfBLT) for forecasting time series data. This non-parametric model captures the underlying system via the Takens' theorem and measures the degree of uncertainty with credible intervals. This is achieved by projecting delay embeddings into a higher-dimensional space via random features and applying regularization within the Bayesian framework to identify relevant terms. Our results demonstrate that the rfBLT method is comparable to traditional statistical models on simulated data, while significantly outperforming both conventional and machine learning models when evaluated on real-world data. The proposed algorithm is implemented in an R package, rfBLT.</p></details> |  |
| **[AlphaCast: A Human Wisdom-LLM Intelligence Co-Reasoning Framework for Interactive Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08947v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a critical role in high-stakes domains such as energy, healthcare, and climate. Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

| **[A Theoretical Analysis of Detecting Large Model-Generated Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07104v3)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the increasing risks of data misuse and fabrication, we investigate the problem of identifying synthetic time series generated by Time-Series Large Models (TSLMs) in this work. While there are extensive researches on detecting model generated text, we find that these existing methods are not applicable to time series data due to the fundamental modality difference, as time series usually have lower information density and smoother probability distributions than text data, which limit the discriminative power of token-based detectors. To address this issue, we examine the subtle distributional differences between real and model-generated time series and propose the contraction hypothesis, which states that model-generated time series, unlike real ones, exhibit progressively decreasing uncertainty under recursive forecasting. We formally prove this hypothesis under theoretical assumptions on model behavior and time series structure. Model-generated time series exhibit progressively concentrated distributions under recursive forecasting, leading to uncertainty contraction. We provide empirical validation of the hypothesis across diverse datasets. Building on this insight, we introduce the Uncertainty Contraction Estimator (UCE), a white-box detector that aggregates uncertainty metrics over successive prefixes to identify TSLM-generated time series. Extensive experiments on 32 datasets show that UCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a reliable and generalizable solution for detecting model-generated time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages,12 figures, to be published in AAAI-2026 main track</p></details> |
| **[Spectral Predictability as a Fast Reliability Indicator for Time Series Forecasting Model Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08884v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Practitioners deploying time series forecasting models face a dilemma: exhaustively validating dozens of models is computationally prohibitive, yet choosing the wrong model risks poor performance. We show that spectral predictability~$Ω$ -- a simple signal processing metric -- systematically stratifies model family performance, enabling fast model selection. We conduct controlled experiments in four different domains, then further expand our analysis to 51 models and 28 datasets from the GIFT-Eval benchmark. We find that large time series foundation models (TSFMs) systematically outperform lightweight task-trained baselines when $Ω$ is high, while their advantage vanishes as $Ω$ drops. Computing $Ω$ takes seconds per dataset, enabling practitioners to quickly assess whether their data suits TSFM approaches or whether simpler, cheaper models suffice. We demonstrate that $Ω$ stratifies model performance predictably, offering a practical first-pass filter that reduces validation costs while highlighting the need for models that excel on genuinely difficult (low-$Ω$) problems rather than merely optimizing easy ones.</p></details> |  |

CSAI extends state-of-the-art neural network-based imputation by introducing key modifications specific to EHR data: a) attention-based hidden state initialisation to capture both long- and short-range temporal dependencies prevalent in EHRs, b) domain-informed temporal decay to mimic clinical data recording patterns, and c) a non-uniform masking strategy that models non-random missingness by calibrating weights according to both temporal and cross-sectional data characteristics. Comprehensive evaluation across four EHR benchmark datasets demonstrates CSAI's effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art architectures in data restoration and downstream tasks. CSAI is integrated into PyPOTS, an open-source Python toolbox designed for machine learning tasks on partially observed time series. This work significantly advances the state of neural network imputation applied to EHRs by more closely aligning algorithmic imputation with clinical realities.</p></details> |  |

It enables intelligent systems, such as robots and self-driving cars, to act safely in dynamic, human-involved environments, and informs broader time-series reasoning challenges. With advances in methods, representations, and datasets, the field has seen rapid progress, reflected in quickly evolving benchmark results. Yet, when state-of-the-art methods are deployed in the real world, they often struggle to generalize to open-world conditions and fall short of deployment standards. This reveals a gap between research benchmarks, which are often idealized or ill-posed, and real-world complexity. To address this gap, this survey revisits the generalization and deployability of motion prediction models, with an emphasis on applications of robotics, autonomous driving, and human motion. We first offer a comprehensive taxonomy of motion prediction methods, covering representations, modeling strategies, application domains, and evaluation protocols. We then study two key challenges: (1) how to push motion prediction models to be deployable to realistic deployment standards, where motion prediction does not act in a vacuum, but functions as one module of closed-loop autonomy stacks - it takes input localization and perception, and informs downstream planning and control. 2) How to generalize motion prediction models from limited seen scenarios/datasets to the open-world settings. Throughout the paper, we highlight critical open challenges to guide future work, aiming to recalibrate the community's efforts, fostering progress that is not only measurable but also meaningful for real-world applications.

In this paper, we present a novel method for efficiently computing the signature kernel of long, high-dimensional time series via adaptively truncated recursive local power series expansions. Building on the characterization of the signature kernel as the solution of a Goursat PDE, our approach employs tilewise Neumann-series expansions to derive rapidly converging power series approximations of the signature kernel that are locally defined on subdomains and propagated iteratively across the entire domain of the Goursat solution by exploiting the geometry of the time series. Algorithmically, this involves solving a system of interdependent Goursat PDEs via adaptively truncated local power series expansions and recursive propagation of boundary conditions along a directed graph in a topological ordering. This method strikes an effective balance between computational cost and accuracy, achieving substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art approaches for computing the signature kernel. It offers (a) adjustable and superior accuracy, even for time series with very high roughness; (b) drastically reduced memory requirements; and (c) scalability to efficiently handle very long time series (one million data points or more) on a single GPU. As demonstrated in our benchmarks, these advantages make our method particularly well-suited for rough-path-assisted machine learning, financial modeling, and signal processing applications involving very long and highly volatile sequential data.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (to appear), 32 pages, 9 figures</p></details> |

While presenting notable progress for the Transformer architecture, iTransformer still lags behind the latest MLP-based models. We attribute this performance gap to unstable inter-channel relationships. To bridge this gap, we propose EMAformer, a simple yet effective model that enhances the Transformer with an auxiliary embedding suite, akin to armor that reinforces its ability. By introducing three key inductive biases, i.e., \textit{global stability}, \textit{phase sensitivity}, and \textit{cross-axis specificity}, EMAformer unlocks the further potential of the Transformer architecture, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 12 real-world benchmarks and reducing forecasting errors by an average of 2.73\% in MSE and 5.15\% in MAE. This significantly advances the practical applicability of Transformer-based approaches for multivariate time series forecasting.

To address these issues, the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has developed various methods aimed at clarifying AI decision-making, thereby facilitating appropriate trust and validating the fairness of outcomes. Among these methods, prototype-based explanations offer a promising approach that uses representative examples to elucidate model behavior. However, a critical gap exists regarding standardized benchmarks to objectively compare prototype-based XAI methods, especially in the context of time series data. This lack of reliable benchmarks results in subjective evaluations, hindering progress in the field. We aim to establish a robust framework, ProtoScore, for assessing prototype-based XAI methods across different data types with a focus on time series data, facilitating fair and comprehensive evaluations. By integrating the Co-12 properties of Nauta et al., this framework allows for effectively comparing prototype methods against each other and against other XAI methods, ultimately assisting practitioners in selecting appropriate explanation methods while minimizing the costs associated with user studies.

| **[HN-MVTS: HyperNetwork-based Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08340v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate forecasting of multivariate time series data remains a formidable challenge, particularly due to the growing complexity of temporal dependencies in real-world scenarios. While neural network-based models have achieved notable success in this domain, complex channel-dependent models often suffer from performance degradation compared to channel-independent models that do not consider the relationship between components but provide high robustness due to small capacity. In this work, we propose HN-MVTS, a novel architecture that integrates a hypernetwork-based generative prior with an arbitrary neural network forecasting model. The input of this hypernetwork is a learnable embedding matrix of time series components. To restrict the number of new parameters, the hypernetwork learns to generate the weights of the last layer of the target forecasting networks, serving as a data-adaptive regularizer that improves generalization and long-range predictive accuracy. The hypernetwork is used only during the training, so it does not increase the inference time compared to the base forecasting model. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that application of HN-MVTS to the state-of-the-art models (DLinear, PatchTST, TSMixer, etc.) typically improves their performance. Our findings suggest that hypernetwork-driven parameterization offers a promising direction for enhancing existing forecasting techniques in complex scenarios.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |

| **[AXIS: Explainable Time Series Anomaly Detection with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24378v2)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) increasingly demands explanations that articulate not only if an anomaly occurred, but also what pattern it exhibits and why it is anomalous. Leveraging the impressive explanatory capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), recent works have attempted to treat time series as text for explainable TSAD. However, this approach faces a fundamental challenge: LLMs operate on discrete tokens and struggle to directly process long, continuous signals. Consequently, naive time-to-text serialization suffers from a lack of contextual grounding and representation alignment between the two modalities. To address this gap, we introduce AXIS, a framework that conditions a frozen LLM for nuanced time-series understanding. Instead of direct serialization, AXIS enriches the LLM's input with three complementary hints derived from the series: (i) a symbolic numeric hint for numerical grounding, (ii) a context-integrated, step-aligned hint distilled from a pretrained time-series encoder to capture fine-grained dynamics, and (iii) a task-prior hint that encodes global anomaly characteristics. Furthermore, to facilitate robust evaluation of explainability, we introduce a new benchmark featuring multi-format questions and rationales that supervise contextual grounding and pattern-level semantics. Extensive experiments, including both LLM-based and human evaluations, demonstrate that AXIS yields explanations of significantly higher quality and achieves competitive detection accuracy compared to general-purpose LLMs, specialized time-series LLMs, and time-series Vision Language Models.</p></details> |  |

Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce \texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning to reconstruct inputs, \texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows. This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture, enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{TimeRCD} significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |

SRE leverages tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor system metrics, defining critical Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for maintaining high service standards. However, a significant challenge arises as many developers often lack in-depth understanding of these tools and the intricacies involved in defining appropriate SLIs and SLOs. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel SRE platform, called SRE-Llama, enhanced by Generative-AI, Federated Learning, Blockchain, and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This platform aims to automate and simplify the process of monitoring, SLI/SLO generation, and alert management, offering ease in accessibility and efficy for developers. The system operates by capturing metrics from cloud-native services and storing them in a time-series database, like Prometheus and Mimir. Utilizing this stored data, our platform employs Federated Learning models to identify the most relevant and impactful SLI metrics for different services and SLOs, addressing concerns around data privacy. Subsequently, fine-tuned Meta's Llama-3 LLM is adopted to intelligently generate SLIs, SLOs, error budgets, and associated alerting mechanisms based on these identified SLI metrics. A unique aspect of our platform is the encoding of generated SLIs and SLOs as NFT objects, which are then stored on a Blockchain. This feature provides immutable record-keeping and facilitates easy verification and auditing of the SRE metrics and objectives. The automation of the proposed platform is governed by the blockchain smart contracts. The proposed SRE-Llama platform prototype has been implemented with a use case featuring a customized Open5GS 5G Core.</p></details> |  |

These time series are typically multivariate and often comprise hundreds of heterogeneous features from different data sources. The grouping of features based on similarity and relevance to the prediction task has been shown to enhance the performance of deep learning architectures. However, defining these groups a priori using only semantic knowledge is challenging, even for domain experts. To address this, we propose a novel method that learns feature groups by clustering weights of feature-wise embedding layers. This approach seamlessly integrates into standard supervised training and discovers the groups that directly improve downstream performance on clinically relevant tasks. We demonstrate that our method outperforms static clustering approaches on synthetic data and achieves performance comparable to expert-defined groups on real-world medical data. Moreover, the learned feature groups are clinically interpretable, enabling data-driven discovery of task-relevant relationships between variables.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) 2025 in Proceedings of Machine Learning Research 297</p></details> |

However, a fundamental challenge in their training is the reliance on static loss functions, which may not be optimal across all learning stages. To address this issue, in this paper a hybrid model integrating the Hyena architecture with a Dynamic Loss Network (DLN) is proposed which is guided by a Learn-to-Teach (L2T) approach (L2T-DLN). In this framework, the Hyena model is a student, and its loss function is optimized adaptively. A teacher model, leveraging a memory of the student's past performance, guides the DLN in dynamically balancing the primary cross-entropy loss and a regularization term. Experiments on the Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset show that our approach significantly improves language modeling performance. Our proposed model achieved a validation Perplexity of 102.6, a notable improvement over the 110.4 achieved by a baseline Hyena model using a static loss function. This research indicates that combining SSMs with adaptive loss function markedly enhances the quality and efficiency of deep learning models for sequential data, showing potential for applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP), time-series analysis, and biological signal processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Clustering-based Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08072v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series data come as a collection of time series describing different aspects of a certain temporal phenomenon. Anomaly detection in this type of data constitutes a challenging problem yet with numerous applications in science and engineering because anomaly scores come from the simultaneous consideration of the temporal and variable relationships. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based approach to detect anomalies concerning the amplitude and the shape of multivariate time series. First, we use a sliding window to generate a set of multivariate subsequences and thereafter apply an extended fuzzy clustering to reveal a structure present within the generated multivariate subsequences. Finally, a reconstruction criterion is employed to reconstruct the multivariate subsequences with the optimal cluster centers and the partition matrix. We construct a confidence index to quantify a level of anomaly detected in the series and apply Particle Swarm Optimization as an optimization vehicle for the problem of anomaly detection. Experimental studies completed on several synthetic and six real-world datasets suggest that the proposed methods can detect the anomalies in multivariate time series. With the help of available clusters revealed by the extended fuzzy clustering, the proposed framework can detect anomalies in the multivariate time series and is suitable for identifying anomalous amplitude and shape patterns in various application domains such as health care, weather data analysis, finance, and disease outbreak detection.</p></details> | 33 pages, 20 figures |

In marine science, it is common for biologists and geologists to identify regional differences based on expert knowledge, frequently through data visualization. However, time series data collected through surveys in marine studies typically span only a few decades, limiting the applicability of classical time series methods. Additionally, without expert knowledge, detecting significant differences becomes challenging. To address these issues, we introduce ANOVATS (ANOVA for small-sample time series data), a subsampling-based method to detect regional differences in small-sample time series data with a fixed number of groups. This method bypasses the need for spectral density estimation, which requires a large number of time points in the data. Furthermore, after detecting differences in homogeneity across all areas using the ANOVATS procedure, we devised a simple ANOVATS post hoc procedure to group the areas. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by analyzing zooplankton biomass data collected in different strata of the North Sea, showing its ability to quantify differences in species between geographical areas without relying on prior biological or geographical knowledge.</p></details> | 23 pages, 12 figures |

Mainstream Transformer- and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)-based methods mainly rely on finite look-back windows, limiting their ability to model long-term dependencies and hurting forecasting performance. Naively extending the look-back window proves ineffective, as it not only introduces prohibitive computational complexity, but also drowns vital long-term dependencies in historical noise. To address these challenges, we propose CometNet, a novel Contextual Motif-guided Long-term Time Series Forecasting framework. CometNet first introduces a Contextual Motif Extraction module that identifies recurrent, dominant contextual motifs from complex historical sequences, providing extensive temporal dependencies far exceeding limited look-back windows; Subsequently, a Motif-guided Forecasting module is proposed, which integrates the extracted dominant motifs into forecasting. By dynamically mapping the look-back window to its relevant motifs, CometNet effectively harnesses their contextual information to strengthen long-term forecasting capability. Extensive experimental results on eight real-world datasets have demonstrated that CometNet significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, particularly on extended forecast horizons.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

A major challenge lies in modeling the intrinsic stochasticity of temporal dynamics, as real-world sequences often exhibit random fluctuations and localized variations. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, their generation process is computationally inefficient, often requiring hundreds to thousands of expensive function evaluations per sample. Flow matching has emerged as a more efficient paradigm, yet its conventional ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based formulation fails to explicitly capture stochasticity, thereby limiting the fidelity of generated sequences. By contrast, stochastic differential equation (SDE) are naturally suited for modeling randomness and uncertainty. Motivated by these insights, we propose TimeFlow, a novel SDE-based flow matching framework that integrates a encoder-only architecture. Specifically, we design a component-wise decomposed velocity field to capture the multi-faceted structure of time series and augment the vanilla flow-matching optimization with an additional stochastic term to enhance representational expressiveness. TimeFlow is flexible and general, supporting both unconditional and conditional generation tasks within a unified framework. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms strong baselines in generation quality, diversity, and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, time series data offers fewer augmentation strategies compared to fields such as image or text, with advanced techniques like Mixup rarely being used. In this work, we propose a novel approach, Imputation-Based Mixup Augmentation (IBMA), which combines Imputation-Augmented data with Mixup augmentation to bolster model generalization and improve forecasting performance. We evaluate the effectiveness of this method across several forecasting models, including DLinear (MLP), TimesNet (CNN), and iTrainformer (Transformer), these models represent some of the most recent advances in time series forecasting. Our experiments, conducted on four datasets (ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2) and compared against eight other augmentation techniques, demonstrate that IBMA consistently enhances performance, achieving 22 improvements out of 24 instances, with 10 of those being the best performances, particularly with iTrainformer imputation.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 1 figure, 1 table, accepted at the AAAI2025 conference</p></details> |

However, existing patch-based methods typically adopt fixed-length segmentation, overlooking the heterogeneity of local temporal dynamics and the decoding heterogeneity of forecasting. Such designs lose details in information-dense regions, introduce redundancy in stable segments, and fail to capture the distinct complexities of short-term and long-term horizons. We propose TimeMosaic, a forecasting framework that aims to address temporal heterogeneity. TimeMosaic employs adaptive patch embedding to dynamically adjust granularity according to local information density, balancing motif reuse with structural clarity while preserving temporal continuity. In addition, it introduces segment-wise decoding that treats each prediction horizon as a related subtask and adapts to horizon-specific difficulty and information requirements, rather than applying a single uniform decoder. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TimeMosaic delivers consistent improvements over existing methods, and our model trained on the large-scale corpus with 321 billion observations achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art TSFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by AAAI</p></details> |

Although CFTL has shown promise, current benchmarking practices fall short of accurately assessing its performance. This shortcoming stems from many factors: an over-reliance on small-scale evaluation datasets; inadequate treatment of sample size when computing summary statistics; reporting of suboptimal statistical models; and failing to account for non-negligible risks of overlap between pre-training and test datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified reimplementation of widely-adopted neural forecasting networks, adapting them for the CFTL setup; we pre-train only on proprietary and synthetic data, being careful to prevent test leakage; and we evaluate on 15 large, diverse public forecast competition datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals that statistical models' accuracy is frequently underreported. Notably, we confirm that statistical models and their ensembles consistently outperform existing FFMs by more than 8.2% in sCRPS, and by more than 20% MASE, across datasets. However, we also find that synthetic dataset pre-training does improve the accuracy of a FFM by 7% percent.</p></details> | <details><summary>Thirt...</summary><p>Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems {NeurIPS 2025}.

This limitation arises in many physics problems, such as Mixture Models (MM) with an unknown number of components or the inference of overlapping signals in noisy data, as in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) Global Fit problem. Traditional approaches, such as product-space methods or Reversible-Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC), often face efficiency and convergence limitations. This paper presents samsara, a Continuous-Time Markov Chain Monte Carlo (CTMCMC) framework that models parameter evolution through Poisson-driven birth, death, and mutation processes. samsara is designed to sample models of unknown dimensionality. By requiring detailed balance through adaptive rate definitions, CTMCMC achieves automatic acceptance of trans-dimensional moves and high sampling efficiency. The code features waiting time weighted estimators, optimized memory storage, and a modular design for easy customization. We validate samsara on three benchmark problems: an analytic trans-dimensional distribution, joint inference of sine waves and Lorentzians in time series, and a Gaussian MM with an unknown number of components. In all cases, the code shows excellent agreement with analytical and Nested Sampling results. All these features push samsara as a powerful alternative to RJMCMC for large- and variable-dimensional Bayesian inference problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables, 5 appendices, comments are welcome</p></details> |

Image segmentation is one of the most fundamental problems in computer vision and has drawn a lot of attention due to its vast applications in image understanding and autonomous driving. However, designing effective and efficient segmentation neural architectures is a labor-intensive process that may require numerous trials by human experts. In this paper, we address the challenge of integrating multi-head self-attention into high-resolution representation CNNs efficiently by leveraging architecture search. Manually replacing convolution layers with multi-head self-attention is non-trivial due to the costly overhead in memory to maintain high resolution. By contrast, we develop a multi-target multi-branch supernet method, which not only fully utilizes the advantages of high-resolution features but also finds the proper location for placing the multi-head self-attention module. Our search algorithm is optimized towards multiple objectives (e.g., latency and mIoU) and is capable of finding architectures on the approximate Pareto front with an arbitrary number of branches in a single search. We further present a series of models via the Hybrid Convolutional-Transformer Architecture Search (HyCTAS) method that searches for the best hybrid combination of lightweight convolution layers and memory-efficient self-attention layers between branches from different resolutions and fuses them at high resolution for both efficiency and effectiveness. On Cityscapes, ADE20K, and COCO, HyCTAS discovers competitive real-time models without ImageNet pretraining, delivering strong accuracy and latency trade-offs.

However, the distributed nature of real-world traffic data across multiple stakeholders poses significant challenges in modeling and reconstructing inter-client spatial dependencies while adhering to data locality constraints. Existing methods primarily address static dependencies, overlooking their dynamic nature and resulting in suboptimal performance. In response, we propose Federated Spatio-Temporal Graph with Dynamic Inter-Client Dependencies (FedSTGD), a framework designed to model and reconstruct dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies in federated learning. FedSTGD incorporates a federated nonlinear computation decomposition module to approximate complex graph operations. This is complemented by a graph node embedding augmentation module, which alleviates performance degradation arising from the decomposition. These modules are coordinated through a client-server collective learning protocol, which decomposes dynamic inter-client spatial dependency learning tasks into lightweight, parallelizable subtasks. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedSTGD achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, approaching that of centralized baselines. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each module in addressing dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies, while sensitivity analysis highlights the robustness of FedSTGD to variations in hyperparameters.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods for traffic signal modeling often rely on the original data modality, i.e., numerical direct readings from the sensors in cities. However, this unimodal approach overlooks the semantic information existing in multimodal heterogeneous urban data in different perspectives, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of traffic signals and limits the accurate prediction of complex traffic dynamics. To address this problem, we propose a novel \textit{M}ultimodal framework, \textit{MTP}, for urban \textit{T}raffic \textit{P}rofiling, which learns multimodal features through numeric, visual, and textual perspectives. The three branches drive for a multimodal perspective of urban traffic signal learning in the frequency domain, while the frequency learning strategies delicately refine the information for extraction. Specifically, we first conduct the visual augmentation for the traffic signals, which transforms the original modality into frequency images and periodicity images for visual learning. Also, we augment descriptive texts for the traffic signals based on the specific topic, background information and item description for textual learning. To complement the numeric information, we utilize frequency multilayer perceptrons for learning on the original modality. We design a hierarchical contrastive learning on the three branches to fuse the spectrum of three modalities. Finally, extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

While existing attack vectors demonstrate security concerns, they suffer from visual detectability or implementation constraints, suggesting unexplored vulnerability surfaces in TSR systems. We introduce the Adversarial Retroreflective Patch (ARP), a novel attack vector that combines the high deployability of patch attacks with the stealthiness of laser projections by utilizing retroreflective materials activated only under victim headlight illumination. We develop a retroreflection simulation method and employ black-box optimization to maximize attack effectiveness. ARP achieves $\geq$93.4\% success rate in dynamic scenarios at 35 meters and $\geq$60\% success rate against commercial TSR systems in real-world conditions. Our user study demonstrates that ARP attacks maintain near-identical stealthiness to benign signs while achieving $\geq$1.9\% higher stealthiness scores than previous patch attacks. We propose the DPR Shield defense, employing strategically placed polarized filters, which achieves $\geq$75\% defense success rates for stop signs and speed limit signs against micro-prism patches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leader-Follower Identification Methodology for Non-Lane Disciplined Heterogeneous Traffic Using Steady State Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09946v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Road traffic in developing countries, such as India, features a heterogeneous mix of vehicles operating under weak lane discipline (HWLD), encompassing both motorised and non-motorised modes with diverse sizes and manoeuvrability. These conditions lead to complex driver interactions, complicating the reliable identification of vehicle-following (VF) behaviour and leader-follower (LF) pairs. Traditional identification methods based on fixed thresholds for longitudinal and lateral proximity often misclassify non-following instances as valid LF pairs, degrading model performance. This study presents a refined and adaptive method for LF identification in HWLD traffic. It employs vehicle-type- and speed-specific desirable gap thresholds derived from the fundamental density-speed diagram to eliminate false-positive pairs. Additionally, Mexican Hat Wavelet Transform (MWT) is employed to analyse LV and SV speed profiles, verifying LV-SV interaction for LF pair identification. The three-stage filtering includes: (i) speed-gap consistency, (ii) approach/diverge detection via relative velocity sign changes and gap range, and (iii) wavelet-based speed correlation using MWT to confirm LV influence on SV. The framework effectively filters out LF pairs associated with overtaking, tailgating, and inconsistent gap dynamics, retaining only those with consistent VF behaviour and improving model accuracy. Analysis across thirteen LF combinations shows that VF dynamics depend on both SV and LV types. Symmetric pairs (e.g., CAR-CAR, AUTO-CAR) exhibit higher predictability and lower errors, while asymmetric pairs with heavy vehicles or two-wheelers show greater variability. The framework offers a robust foundation for traffic modelling and behaviour analysis.</p></details> |  |

An Extensive Approach Considering Statistical, Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09450v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With rapid urbanization in recent decades, traffic congestion has intensified due to increased movement of people and goods. As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE. The study concludes by identifying hybrid models as a promising future direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>6,227...</summary><p>6,227 words text + 2*250 (2 tables) = 6,727 words</p></details> |

To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

A core technology for analyzing such images, associated with spatiotemporal information, is Traffic Scene Understanding (TSU), which aims to provide a comprehensive description of the traffic scene. Unlike traditional spatio-temporal data analysis tasks, the dependence on both spatio-temporal and visual-textual data introduces distinct challenges to TSU task. However, recent research often treats TSU as a common image understanding task, ignoring the spatio-temporal information and overlooking the interrelations between different aspects of the traffic scene. To address these issues, we propose a novel SpatioTemporal Enhanced Model based on CILP (ST-CLIP) for TSU. Our model uses the classic vision-language model, CLIP, as the backbone, and designs a Spatio-temporal Context Aware Multiaspect Prompt (SCAMP) learning method to incorporate spatiotemporal information into TSU. The prompt learning method consists of two components: A dynamic spatio-temporal context representation module that extracts representation vectors of spatio-temporal data for each traffic scene image, and a bi-level ST-aware multi-aspect prompt learning module that integrates the ST-context representation vectors into word embeddings of prompts for the CLIP model. The second module also extracts low-level visual features and image-wise high-level semantic features to exploit interactive relations among different aspects of traffic scenes.

| **[M3-Net: A Cost-Effective Graph-Free MLP-Based Model for Traffic Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08543v3)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving accurate traffic prediction is a fundamental but crucial task in the development of current intelligent transportation systems.Most of the mainstream methods that have made breakthroughs in traffic prediction rely on spatio-temporal graph neural networks, spatio-temporal attention mechanisms, etc. The main challenges of the existing deep learning approaches are that they either depend on a complete traffic network structure or require intricate model designs to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. These limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction performance and lightweight deployment.Our code is available at https://github.com/jinguangyin/M3_NET</p></details> |  |
| **[Weaver: Kronecker Product Approximations of Spatiotemporal Attention for Traffic Network Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08888v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal forecasting on transportation networks is a complex task that requires understanding how traffic nodes interact within a dynamic, evolving system dictated by traffic flow dynamics and social behavioral patterns. The importance of transportation networks and ITS for modern mobility and commerce necessitates forecasting models that are not only accurate but also interpretable, efficient, and robust under structural or temporal perturbations. Recent approaches, particularly Transformer-based architectures, have improved predictive performance but often at the cost of high computational overhead and diminished architectural interpretability. In this work, we introduce Weaver, a novel attention-based model that applies Kronecker product approximations (KPA) to decompose the PN X PN spatiotemporal attention of O(P^2N^2) complexity into local P X P temporal and N X N spatial attention maps. This Kronecker attention map enables our Parallel-Kronecker Matrix-Vector product (P2-KMV) for efficient spatiotemporal message passing with O(P^2N + N^2P) complexity. To capture real-world traffic dynamics, we address the importance of negative edges in modeling traffic behavior by introducing Valence Attention using the continuous Tanimoto coefficient (CTC), which provides properties conducive to precise latent graph generation and training stability. To fully utilize the model's learning capacity, we introduce the Traffic Phase Dictionary for self-conditioning. Evaluations on PEMS-BAY and METR-LA show that Weaver achieves competitive performance across model categories while training more efficiently.</p></details> |  |

Macroscopic emission fundamental diagram (eMFD)captures an orderly relationship among emission and aggregated traffic variables at the network level, allowing for real-time monitoring of region-wide emissions and optimal allocation of travel demand to existing networks, reducing urban congestion and associated emissions. However, empirically derived eMFD models are sparse due to historical data limitation. Leveraging a large-scale and granular traffic and emission data derived from probe vehicles, this study is the first to apply machine learning methods to predict the network wide emission rate to traffic relationship in U.S. urban areas at a large scale. The analysis framework and insights developed in this work generate data-driven eMFDs and a deeper understanding of their location dependence on network, infrastructure, land use, and vehicle characteristics, enabling transportation authorities to measure carbon emissions from urban transport of given travel demand and optimize location specific traffic management and planning decisions to mitigate network-wide emissions.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 pag...</summary><p>3 pages, 5 figures, IEEE Big Data 2024 conference</p></details> |

However, it can be difficult to accurately represent the complex traffic patterns of an attack, especially in Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. This paper studies the impact that seemingly similar features created by different network traffic flow exporters can have on the generalization and robustness of ML models. In addition to the original CSV files of the Bot-IoT, IoT-23, and CICIoT23 datasets, the raw network packets of their PCAP files were analysed with the HERA tool, generating new labelled flows and extracting consistent features for new CSV versions. To assess the usefulness of these new flows for intrusion detection, they were compared with the original versions and were used to fine-tune multiple models. Overall, the results indicate that directly analysing and preprocessing PCAP files, instead of just using the commonly available CSV files, enables the computation of more relevant features to train bagging and gradient boosting decision tree ensembles. It is important to continue improving feature extraction and feature selection processes to make different datasets more compatible and enable a trustworthy evaluation and comparison of the ML models used in cybersecurity solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 12 tables, 1 figure, FPS 2025 conference</p></details> |
| **[Capturing Complex Spatial-Temporal Dependencies in Traffic Forecasting: A Self-Attention Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07980v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of traffic forecasting, aiming to predict the inflow and outflow of a region in the subsequent time slot. The problem is complex due to the intricate spatial and temporal interdependence among regions. Prior works study the spatial and temporal dependency in a decouple manner, failing to capture their joint effect. In this work, we propose ST-SAM, a novel and efficient Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention Model for traffic forecasting. ST-SAM uses a region embedding layer to learn time-specific embedding from traffic data for regions. Then, it employs a spatial-temporal dependency learning module based on self-attention mechanism to capture the joint spatial-temporal dependency for both nearby and faraway regions. ST-SAM entirely relies on self-attention to capture both local and global spatial-temporal correlations, which make it effective and efficient. Extensive experiments on two real world datasets show that ST-SAM is substantially more accurate and efficient than the state-of-the-art approaches (with an average improvement of up to 15% on RMSE, 17% on MAPE, and 32 times on training time in our experiments).</p></details> | 5 pages |

In our approach, each robot autonomously plans its path and shares this information with a centralized node. The centralized system detects potential conflicts and allows only one of the conflicting robots to proceed at a time, instructing others to stop outside the conflicting area to avoid deadlocks. Unlike traditional centralized planning methods, our system does not dictate robot paths but instead provides stop commands, functioning as a virtual traffic light. In simulation experiments with multiple robots, our approach increased the success rate of robots reaching their goals while reducing deadlocks. Furthermore, we successfully validated the system in real-world experiments with two quadruped robots and separately with wheeled Duckiebots.</p></details> |  |

Existing machine learning (ML)-based approaches, typically trained on static single-domain datasets, often fail to generalize across heterogeneous network environments. To address this gap, we develop a realistic Docker-NS3-based testbed that emulates both IoT and traditional traffic conditions, enabling the generation and capture of live, labeled network flows. The resulting M-En Dataset combines this traffic with curated public PCAP traces to provide comprehensive coverage of benign and malicious behaviors. Building on this foundation, we propose Multi-LF, a real-time continuous learning framework that combines a lightweight model (M1) for rapid detection with a deeper model (M2) for high-confidence refinement and adaptation. A confidence-based coordination mechanism enhances efficiency without compromising accuracy, while weight interpolation mitigates catastrophic forgetting during continuous updates. Features extracted at 1-second intervals capture fine-grained temporal patterns, enabling early recognition of evolving attack behaviors. Implemented and evaluated within the Docker-NS3 testbed on live traffic, Multi-LF achieves an accuracy of 0.999 while requiring human intervention for only 0.0026 percent of packets, demonstrating its effectiveness and practicality for real-time malicious traffic detection in heterogeneous network environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version (v2) corresponds to the revised manuscript submitted to the Journal of Network and Computer Applications (Elsevier).

| **[On the Redundant Distributed Observability of Mixed Traffic Transportation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06950v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, the problem of distributed state estimation of human-driven vehicles (HDVs) by connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is investigated in mixed traffic transportation systems. Toward this, a distributed observable state-space model is derived, which paves the way for estimation and observability analysis of HDVs in mixed traffic scenarios. In this direction, first, we obtain the condition on the network topology to satisfy the distributed observability, i.e., the condition such that each HDV state is observable to every CAV via information-exchange over the network. It is shown that strong connectivity of the network, along with the proper design of the observer gain, is sufficient for this. A distributed observer is then designed by locally sharing estimates/observations of each CAV with its neighborhood. Second, in case there exist faulty sensors or unreliable observation data, we derive the condition for redundant distributed observability as a $q$-node/link-connected network design. This redundancy is achieved by extra information-sharing over the network and implies that a certain number of faulty sensors and unreliable links can be isolated/removed without losing the observability. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>EURAS...</summary><p>EURASIP journal on advances in signal processing</p></details> |

FedNET employs Federated Learning (FL) to model the temporal evolution of node-level traffic in a distributed manner, enabling accurate multi-step-ahead predictions (e.g., several hours to days) without exposing sensitive network data. Using these node-level forecasts and known routing information, FedNET estimates the future link-level utilization by aggregating traffic contributions across all source-destination pairs. The links are then ranked according to the predicted load intensity and temporal variability, providing an early warning signal for potential high-risk links. We compare the federated traffic prediction of FedNET against a centralized multi-step learning baseline and then systematically analyze the impact of history and prediction window sizes on forecast accuracy using the $R^2$ score. Results indicate that FL achieves accuracy close to centralized training, with shorter prediction horizons consistently yielding the highest accuracy ($R^2 >0.92$), while longer horizons providing meaningful forecasts ($R^2 \approx 0.45\text{--}0.55$). We further validate the efficacy of the FedNET framework in predicting network utilization on a realistic network topology and demonstrate that it consistently identifies high-risk links well in advance (i.e., three days ahead) of the critical stress states emerging, making it a practical tool for anticipatory traffic engineering and capacity planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Vehicles at Unsignalized Intersections: Safety and Efficiency Implications of Mixed Human and Automated Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12538v3)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of automated vehicles (AVs) into transportation systems presents an unprecedented opportunity to enhance road safety and efficiency. However, understanding the interactions between AVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs) at intersections remains an open research question. This study aims to bridge this gap by examining behavioral differences and adaptations of AVs and HVs at unsignalized intersections by utilizing two large-scale AV datasets from Waymo and Lyft. By using a systematic methodology, the research identifies and analyzes merging and crossing conflicts by calculating key safety and efficiency metrics, including time to collision (TTC), post-encroachment time (PET), maximum required deceleration (MRD), time advantage (TA), and speed and acceleration profiles. Through this approach, the study assesses the safety and efficiency implications of these behavioral differences and adaptations for mixed-autonomy traffic. The findings reveal a paradox: while AVs maintain larger safety margins, their conservative behavior can lead to unexpected situations for human drivers, potentially causing unsafe conditions. From a performance point of view, human drivers tend to exhibit more consistent behavior when interacting with AVs versus other HVs, suggesting AVs may contribute to harmonizing traffic flow patterns. Moreover, notable differences were observed between Waymo and Lyft vehicles, which highlights the importance of considering manufacturer-specific AV behaviors in traffic modeling and management strategies for the safe integration of AVs. The processed dataset, as well as the developed algorithms and scripts, are openly published to foster research on AV-HV interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published OnlineFirst in Transportation Research Record (TRR), DOI: 10.1177/03611981251370343</p></details> |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning for Fair and Efficient Urban Traffic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06363v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The optimization of urban traffic is threatened by the complexity of achieving a balance between transport efficiency and the maintenance of privacy, as well as the equitable distribution of traffic based on socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods. Current centralized traffic management schemes invade user location privacy and further entrench traffic disparity by offering disadvantaged route suggestions, whereas current federated learning frameworks do not consider fairness constraints in multi-objective traffic settings. This study presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework, termed FedFair-Traffic, that jointly and simultaneously optimizes travel efficiency, traffic fairness, and differential privacy protection. This is the first attempt to integrate three conflicting objectives to improve urban transportation systems. The proposed methodology enables collaborative learning between related vehicles with data locality by integrating Graph Neural Networks with differential privacy mechanisms ($ε$-privacy guarantees) and Gini coefficient-based fair constraints using multi-objective optimization. The framework uses federated aggregation methods of gradient clipping and noise injection to provide differential privacy and optimize Pareto-efficient solutions for the efficiency-fairness tradeoff. Real-world comprehensive experiments on the METR-LA traffic dataset showed that FedFair-Traffic can reduce the average travel time by 7\% (14.2 minutes) compared with their centralized baselines, promote traffic fairness by 73\% (Gini coefficient, 0.78), and offer high privacy protection (privacy score, 0.8) with an 89\% reduction in communication overhead. These outcomes demonstrate that FedFair-Traffic is a scalable privacy-aware smart city infrastructure with possible use-cases in metropolitan traffic flow control and federated transportation networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at IEEE journal</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Guided Reinforcement Learning with Representative Agents for Traffic Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06260v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as behavioral proxies for self-interested travelers in agent-based traffic models. Although more flexible and generalizable than conventional models, the practical use of these approaches remains limited by scalability due to the cost of calling one LLM for every traveler. Moreover, it has been found that LLM agents often make opaque choices and produce unstable day-to-day dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose to model each homogeneous traveler group facing the same decision context with a single representative LLM agent who behaves like the population's average, maintaining and updating a mixed strategy over routes that coincides with the group's aggregate flow proportions. Each day, the LLM reviews the travel experience and flags routes with positive reinforcement that they hope to use more often, and an interpretable update rule then converts this judgment into strategy adjustments using a tunable (progressively decaying) step size. The representative-agent design improves scalability, while the separation of reasoning from updating clarifies the decision logic while stabilizing learning. In classic traffic assignment settings, we find that the proposed approach converges rapidly to the user equilibrium. In richer settings with income heterogeneity, multi-criteria costs, and multi-modal choices, the generated dynamics remain stable and interpretable, reproducing plausible behavioral patterns well-documented in psychology and economics, for example, the decoy effect in toll versus non-toll road selection, and higher willingness-to-pay for convenience among higher-income travelers when choosing between driving, transit, and park-and-ride options.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Origin-Destination Matrix Estimation in Microscopic Traffic Simulations Considering Credit Assignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06229v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on dynamic origin-destination matrix estimation (DODE), a crucial calibration process necessary for the effective application of microscopic traffic simulations. The fundamental challenge of the DODE problem in microscopic simulations stems from the complex temporal dynamics and inherent uncertainty of individual vehicle dynamics. This makes it highly challenging to precisely determine which vehicle traverses which link at any given moment, resulting in intricate and often ambiguous relationships between origin-destination (OD) matrices and their contributions to resultant link flows. This phenomenon constitutes the credit assignment problem, a central challenge addressed in this study. We formulate the DODE problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a novel framework that applies model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Within our proposed framework, the agent learns an optimal policy to sequentially generate OD matrices, refining its strategy through direct interaction with the simulation environment. The proposed method is validated on the Nguyen-Dupuis network using SUMO, where its performance is evaluated against ground-truth link flows aggregated at 5-minute intervals over a 30-minute horizon. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a 43.2% reduction in mean squared error (MSE) compared to the best-performing conventional baseline. By reframing DODE as a sequential decision-making problem, our approach addresses the credit assignment challenge through its learned policy, thereby overcoming the limitations of conventional methods and proposing a novel framework for calibration of microscopic traffic simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Neural policies, however, tend to be over-parameterized and non-transparent, hindering their interpretability and deployability on resource-limited edge devices. This work presents SymLight, a priority function search framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for discovering inherently interpretable and deployable symbolic priority functions to serve as the TSC policies. The priority function, in particular, accepts traffic features as input and then outputs a priority for each traffic signal phase, which subsequently directs the phase transition. For effective search, we propose a concise yet expressive priority function representation. This helps mitigate the combinatorial explosion of the action space in MCTS. Additionally, a probabilistic structural rollout strategy is introduced to leverage structural patterns from previously discovered high-quality priority functions, guiding the rollout process. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate SymLight's superior performance across a range of baselines. A key advantage is SymLight's ability to produce interpretable and deployable TSC policies while maintaining excellent performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[BLADE: Behavior-Level Anomaly Detection Using Network Traffic in Web Services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05193v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With their widespread popularity, web services have become the main targets of various cyberattacks. Existing traffic anomaly detection approaches focus on flow-level attacks, yet fail to recognize behavior-level attacks, which appear benign in individual flows but reveal malicious purpose using multiple network flows. To transcend this limitation, we propose a novel unsupervised traffic anomaly detection system, BLADE, capable of detecting not only flow-level but also behavior-level attacks in web services. Our key observation is that application-layer operations of web services exhibit distinctive communication patterns at the network layer from a multi-flow perspective. BLADE first exploits a flow autoencoder to learn a latent feature representation and calculates its reconstruction losses per flow. Then, the latent representation is assigned a pseudo operation label using an unsupervised clustering method. Next, an anomaly score is computed based on the reconstruction losses. Finally, the triplets of timestamps, pseudo labels, and anomaly scores from multiple flows are aggregated and fed into a one-class classifier to characterize the behavior patterns of legitimate web operations, enabling the detection of flow-level and behavior-level anomalies. BLADE is extensively evaluated on both the custom dataset and the CIC-IDS2017 dataset. The experimental results demonstrate BLADE's superior performance, achieving high F1 scores of 0.9732 and 0.9801, respectively, on the two datasets, and outperforming traditional single-flow anomaly detection baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE MSN 2025</p></details> |
| **[Self-Interest and Systemic Benefits: Emergence of Collective Rationality in Mixed Autonomy Traffic Through Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04883v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to be commercially available in the near future, leading to mixed autonomy traffic consisting of both AVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs). Although numerous studies have shown that AVs can be deployed to benefit the overall traffic system performance by incorporating system-level goals into their decision making, it is not clear whether the benefits still exist when agents act out of self-interest -- a trait common to all driving agents, both human and autonomous. This study aims to understand whether self-interested AVs can bring benefits to all driving agents in mixed autonomy traffic systems. The research is centered on the concept of collective rationality (CR). This concept, originating from game theory and behavioral economics, means that driving agents may cooperate collectively even when pursuing individual interests. Our recent research has proven the existence of CR in an analytical game-theoretical model and empirically in mixed human-driven traffic. In this paper, we demonstrate that CR can be attained among driving agents trained using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with a simple reward design. We examine the extent to which self-interested traffic agents can achieve CR without directly incorporating system-level objectives. Results show that CR consistently emerges in various scenarios, which indicates the robustness of this property. We also postulate a mechanism to explain the emergence of CR in the microscopic and dynamic environment and verify it based on simulation evidence. This research suggests the possibility of leveraging advanced learning methods (such as federated learning) to achieve collective cooperation among self-interested driving agents in mixed-autonomy systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smartphone User Fingerprinting on Wireless Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03229v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the openness of the wireless medium, smartphone users are susceptible to user privacy attacks, where user privacy information is inferred from encrypted Wi-Fi wireless traffic. Existing attacks are limited to recognizing mobile apps and their actions and cannot infer the smartphone user identity, a fundamental part of user privacy. To overcome this limitation, we propose U-Print, a novel attack system that can passively recognize smartphone apps, actions, and users from over-the-air MAC-layer frames. We observe that smartphone users usually prefer different add-on apps and in-app actions, yielding different changing patterns in Wi-Fi traffic. U-Print first extracts multi-level traffic features and exploits customized temporal convolutional networks to recognize smartphone apps and actions, thus producing users' behavior sequences. Then, it leverages the silhouette coefficient method to determine the number of users and applies the k-means clustering to profile and identify smartphone users. We implement U-Print using a laptop with a Kali dual-band wireless network card and evaluate it in three real-world environments. U-Print achieves an overall accuracy of 98.4% and an F1 score of 0.983 for user inference. Moreover, it can correctly recognize up to 96% of apps and actions in the closed world and more than 86% in the open world.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.07263</p></details> |
| **[Modeling Headway in Heterogeneous and Mixed Traffic Flow: A Statistical Distribution Based on a General Exponential Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03154v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability of existing headway distributions to accurately reflect the diverse behaviors and characteristics in heterogeneous traffic (different types of vehicles) and mixed traffic (human-driven vehicles with autonomous vehicles) is limited, leading to unsatisfactory goodness of fit. To address these issues, we modified the exponential function to obtain a novel headway distribution. Rather than employing Euler's number (e) as the base of the exponential function, we utilized a real number base to provide greater flexibility in modeling the observed headway. However, the proposed is not a probability function. We normalize it to calculate the probability and derive the closed-form equation. In this study, we utilized a comprehensive experiment with five open datasets: highD, exiD, NGSIM, Waymo, and Lyft to evaluate the performance of the proposed distribution and compared its performance with six existing distributions under mixed and heterogeneous traffic flow. The results revealed that the proposed distribution not only captures the fundamental characteristics of headway distribution but also provides physically meaningful parameters that describe the distribution shape of observed headways. Under heterogeneous flow on highways (i.e., uninterrupted traffic flow), the proposed distribution outperforms other candidate distributions. Under urban road conditions (i.e., interrupted traffic flow), including heterogeneous and mixed traffic, the proposed distribution still achieves decent results.</p></details> |  |

The dataset comprises 26,646 high-resolution (1080p) images sampled from 2800 Bengaluru's Safe-City CCTV cameras over a 4-week period, and subsequently annotated through a crowdsourced hackathon involving 565 college students from across India. In total, 1.8 million bounding boxes were labeled across 14 vehicle classes specific to India: Cycle, 2-Wheeler (Motorcycle), 3-Wheeler (Auto-rickshaw), LCV (Light Commercial Vehicles), Van, Tempo-traveller, Hatchback, Sedan, SUV, MUV, Mini-bus, Bus, Truck and Other. Of these, 283k-316k consensus ground truth bounding boxes and labels were derived for distinct objects in the 26k images using Majority Voting and STAPLE algorithms. Further, we train multiple contemporary detectors, including YOLO11-S/X, RT-DETR-S/X, and DAMO-YOLO-T/L using these datasets, and report accuracy based on mAP50, mAP75 and mAP50:95. Models trained on UVH-26 achieve 8.4-31.5% improvements in mAP50:95 over equivalent baseline models trained on COCO dataset, with RT-DETR-X showing the best performance at 0.67 (mAP50:95) as compared to 0.40 for COCO-trained weights for common classes (Car, Bus, and Truck). This demonstrates the benefits of domain-specific training data for Indian traffic scenarios. The release package provides the 26k images with consensus annotations based on Majority Voting (UVH-26-MV) and STAPLE (UVH-26-ST) and the 6 fine-tuned YOLO and DETR models on each of these datasets. By capturing the heterogeneity of Indian urban mobility directly from operational traffic-camera streams, UVH-26 addresses a critical gap in existing global benchmarks, and offers a foundation for advancing detection, classification, and deployment of intelligent transportation systems in emerging nations with complex traffic conditions.</p></details> |  |

However, such testing is limited by the scarcity of long-tailed, safety-critical scenarios in existing datasets collected in the real world. To tackle the data issue, we propose the Adv-BMT framework, which augments real-world scenarios with diverse and realistic adversarial traffic interactions. The core component of Adv-BMT is a bidirectional motion transformer (BMT) model to perform inverse traffic motion predictions, which takes agent information in the last time step of the scenario as input, and reconstructs the traffic in the inverse of chronological order until the initial time step. The Adv-BMT framework is a two-staged pipeline: it first conducts adversarial initializations and then inverse motion predictions. Different from previous work, we do not need any collision data for pretraining, and are able to generate realistic and diverse collision interactions. Our experimental results validate the quality of generated collision scenarios by Adv-BMT: training in our augmented dataset would reduce episode collision rates by 20%. Demo and code are available at: https://metadriverse.github.io/adv-bmt/.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Online Robust Tensor Recovery Approach for Streaming Traffic Data Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01267v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data quality is critical to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), as complete and accurate traffic data underpin reliable decision-making in traffic control and management. Recent advances in low-rank tensor recovery algorithms have shown strong potential in capturing the inherent structure of high-dimensional traffic data and restoring degraded observations. However, traditional batch-based methods demand substantial computational and storage resources, which limits their scalability in the face of continuously expanding traffic data volumes. Moreover, recent online tensor recovery methods often suffer from severe performance degradation in complex real-world scenarios due to their insufficient exploitation of the intrinsic structural properties of traffic data. To address these challenges, we reformulate the traffic data recovery problem within a streaming framework, and propose a novel online robust tensor recovery algorithm that simultaneously leverages both the global spatio-temporal correlations and local consistency of traffic data, achieving high recovery accuracy and significantly improved computational efficiency in large-scale scenarios. Our method is capable of simultaneously handling missing and anomalous values in traffic data, and demonstrates strong adaptability across diverse missing patterns. Experimental results on three real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high recovery accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency by up to three orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art batch-based methods. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed approach as a scalable and effective solution for traffic data quality enhancement in ITS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-agent Reinforcement Learning Model for Regional Adaptive Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00551v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several studies have employed reinforcement learning (RL) to address the challenges of regional adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) and achieved promising results. In this field, existing research predominantly adopts multi-agent frameworks. However, the adoption of multi-agent frameworks presents challenges for scalability. Instead, the Traffic signal control (TSC) problem necessitates a single-agent framework. TSC inherently relies on centralized management by a single control center, which can monitor traffic conditions across all roads in the study area and coordinate the control of all intersections. This work proposes a single-agent RL-based regional ATSC model compatible with probe vehicle technology. Key components of the RL design include state, action, and reward function definitions. To facilitate learning and manage congestion, both state and reward functions are defined based on queue length, with action designed to regulate queue dynamics. The queue length definition used in this study differs slightly from conventional definitions but is closely correlated with congestion states. More importantly, it allows for reliable estimation using link travel time data from probe vehicles. With probe vehicle data already covering most urban roads, this feature enhances the proposed method's potential for widespread deployment. The method was comprehensively evaluated using the SUMO simulation platform. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively mitigates large-scale regional congestion levels via coordinated multi-intersection control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Single-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Regional Traffic Signal Control Under Demand Fluctuations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00549v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic congestion, primarily driven by intersection queuing, significantly impacts urban living standards, safety, environmental quality, and economic efficiency. While Traffic Signal Control (TSC) systems hold potential for congestion mitigation, traditional optimization models often fail to capture real-world traffic complexity and dynamics. This study introduces a novel single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework for regional adaptive TSC, circumventing the coordination complexities inherent in multi-agent systems through a centralized decision-making paradigm. The model employs an adjacency matrix to unify the encoding of road network topology, real-time queue states derived from probe vehicle data, and current signal timing parameters. Leveraging the efficient learning capabilities of the DreamerV3 world model, the agent learns control policies where actions sequentially select intersections and adjust their signal phase splits to regulate traffic inflow/outflow, analogous to a feedback control system. Reward design prioritizes queue dissipation, directly linking congestion metrics (queue length) to control actions. Simulation experiments conducted in SUMO demonstrate the model's effectiveness: under inference scenarios with multi-level (10%, 20%, 30%) Origin-Destination (OD) demand fluctuations, the framework exhibits robust anti-fluctuation capability and significantly reduces queue lengths. This work establishes a new paradigm for intelligent traffic control compatible with probe vehicle technology. Future research will focus on enhancing practical applicability by incorporating stochastic OD demand fluctuations during training and exploring regional optimization mechanisms for contingency events.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information-Theoretic Greedy Layer-wise Training for Traffic Sign Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27651v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained with a global cross-entropy loss in a supervised end-to-end manner: neurons need to store their outgoing weights; training alternates between a forward pass (computation) and a top-down backward pass (learning) which is biologically implausible. Alternatively, greedy layer-wise training eliminates the need for cross-entropy loss and backpropagation. By avoiding the computation of intermediate gradients and the storage of intermediate outputs, it reduces memory usage and helps mitigate issues such as vanishing or exploding gradients. However, most existing layer-wise training approaches have been evaluated only on relatively small datasets with simple deep architectures. In this paper, we first systematically analyze the training dynamics of popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) through an information-theoretic lens. Our findings reveal that networks converge layer-by-layer from bottom to top and that the flow of information adheres to a Markov information bottleneck principle. Building on these observations, we propose a novel layer-wise training approach based on the recently developed deterministic information bottleneck (DIB) and the matrix-based Rényi's $α$-order entropy functional. Specifically, each layer is trained jointly with an auxiliary classifier that connects directly to the output layer, enabling the learning of minimal sufficient task-relevant representations. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our training procedure on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using modern deep CNNs and further demonstrate its applicability to a practical task involving traffic sign recognition. Our approach not only outperforms existing layer-wise training baselines but also achieves performance comparable to SGD.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Dual Large Language Models Architecture with Herald Guided Prompts for Parallel Fine Grained Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00136v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging large language models (LLMs) in traffic signal control (TSC) improves optimization efficiency and interpretability compared to traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods. However, existing LLM-based approaches are limited by fixed time signal durations and are prone to hallucination errors, while RL methods lack robustness in signal timing decisions and suffer from poor generalization. To address these challenges, this paper proposes HeraldLight, a dual LLMs architecture enhanced by Herald guided prompts. The Herald Module extracts contextual information and forecasts queue lengths for each traffic phase based on real-time conditions. The first LLM, LLM-Agent, uses these forecasts to make fine grained traffic signal control, while the second LLM, LLM-Critic, refines LLM-Agent's outputs, correcting errors and hallucinations. These refined outputs are used for score-based fine-tuning to improve accuracy and robustness. Simulation experiments using CityFlow on real world datasets covering 224 intersections in Jinan (12), Hangzhou (16), and New York (196) demonstrate that HeraldLight outperforms state of the art baselines, achieving a 20.03% reduction in average travel time across all scenarios and a 10.74% reduction in average queue length on the Jinan and Hangzhou scenarios.

Traditional batch learning models face challenges such as high maintenance and poor adaptability to rapid anomaly changes, known as concept drift. In contrast, streaming learning integrates online and incremental learning, enabling seamless updates and concept drift detection to improve robustness. This study investigates anomaly detection in streaming IoT traffic as binary classification, comparing batch and streaming learning approaches while assessing the limitations of current IoT traffic datasets. We simulated heterogeneous network data streams by carefully mixing existing datasets and streaming the samples one by one. Our results highlight the failure of batch models to handle concept drift, but also reveal persisting limitations of current datasets to expose model limitations due to low traffic heterogeneity. We also investigated the competitiveness of tree-based ML algorithms, well-known in batch anomaly detection, and compared it to non-tree-based ones, confirming the advantages of the former. Adaptive Random Forest achieved F1-score of 0.990 $\pm$ 0.006 at one-third the computational cost of its batch counterpart. Hoeffding Adaptive Tree reached F1-score of 0.910 $\pm$ 0.007, reducing computational cost by four times, making it a viable choice for online applications despite a slight trade-off in stability.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Traditional accident prediction models treat road segments independently, failing to capture complex spatial relationships and temporal dependencies in urban transportation networks. This study develops MDAS-GNN, a Multi-Dimensional Attention-based Spatial-diffusion Graph Neural Network integrating three core risk dimensions: traffic safety, infrastructure, and environmental risk. The framework employs feature-specific spatial diffusion mechanisms and multi-head temporal attention to capture dependencies across different time horizons. Evaluated on UK Department for Transport accident data across Central London, South Manchester, and SE Birmingham, MDASGNN achieves superior performance compared to established baseline methods. The model maintains consistently low prediction errors across short, medium, and long-term periods, with particular strength in long-term forecasting. Ablation studies confirm that integrated multi-dimensional features outperform singlefeature approaches, reducing prediction errors by up to 40%. This framework provides civil engineers and urban planners with advanced predictive capabilities for transportation infrastructure design, enabling data-driven decisions for road network optimization, infrastructure resource improvements, and strategic safety interventions in urban development projects.</p></details> |  |

However, existing MLLMs in this domain primarily focus on coarse-grained image-level or video-level comprehension and often struggle to handle fine-grained visual details or localized scene components, limiting their applicability in complex accident scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose SafePLUG, a novel framework that empowers MLLMs with both Pixel-Level Understanding and temporal Grounding for comprehensive traffic accident analysis. SafePLUG supports both arbitrary-shaped visual prompts for region-aware question answering and pixel-level segmentation based on language instructions, while also enabling the recognition of temporally anchored events in traffic accident scenarios. To advance the development of MLLMs for traffic accident understanding, we curate a new dataset containing multimodal question-answer pairs centered on diverse accident scenarios, with detailed pixel-level annotations and temporal event boundaries. Experimental results show that SafePLUG achieves strong performance on multiple tasks, including region-based question answering, pixel-level segmentation, temporal event localization, and accident event understanding. These capabilities lay a foundation for fine-grained understanding of complex traffic scenes, with the potential to improve driving safety and enhance situational awareness in smart transportation systems.

| **[A Cloud-Based Spatio-Temporal GNN-Transformer Hybrid Model for Traffic Flow Forecasting with External Feature Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27039v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate traffic flow forecasting is essential for the development of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), supporting tasks such as traffic signal optimization, congestion management, and route planning. Traditional models often fail to effectively capture complex spatial-temporal dependencies in large-scale road networks, especially under the influence of external factors such as weather, holidays, and traffic accidents. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a cloud-based hybrid model that integrates Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNN) with a Transformer architecture for traffic flow prediction. The model leverages the strengths of GNNs in modeling spatial correlations across road networks and the Transformers' ability to capture long-term temporal dependencies. External contextual features are incorporated via feature fusion to enhance predictive accuracy. The proposed model is deployed on a cloud computing platform to achieve scalability and real-time adaptability. Experimental evaluation of the dataset shows that our model outperforms baseline methods (LSTM, TCN, GCN, pure Transformer) with an RMSE of only 17.92 and a MAE of only 10.53. These findings suggest that the hybrid GNN-Transformer approach provides an effective and scalable solution for cloud-based ITS applications, offering methodological advancements for traffic flow forecasting and practical implications for congestion mitigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval Augmented Generation-Enhanced Distributed LLM Agents for Generalizable Traffic Signal Control with Emergency Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26242v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3 adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17 to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[DARTS: A Drone-Based AI-Powered Real-Time Traffic Incident Detection System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26004v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid and reliable incident detection is critical for reducing crash-related fatalities, injuries, and congestion. However, conventional methods, such as closed-circuit television, dashcam footage, and sensor-based detection, separate detection from verification, suffer from limited flexibility, and require dense infrastructure or high penetration rates, restricting adaptability and scalability to shifting incident hotspots. To overcome these challenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic incident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial perspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better low-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep learning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident detection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected dataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity assessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a web-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS detected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local transportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion propagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and enable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk. Crucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on frequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and cost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings. This study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated real-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for the operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation management.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version.

| **[VISAT: Benchmarking Adversarial and Distribution Shift Robustness in Traffic Sign Recognition with Visual Attributes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26833v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present VISAT, a novel open dataset and benchmarking suite for evaluating model robustness in the task of traffic sign recognition with the presence of visual attributes. Built upon the Mapillary Traffic Sign Dataset (MTSD), our dataset introduces two benchmarks that respectively emphasize robustness against adversarial attacks and distribution shifts. For our adversarial attack benchmark, we employ the state-of-the-art Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) method to generate adversarial inputs and evaluate their impact on popular models. Additionally, we investigate the effect of adversarial attacks on attribute-specific multi-task learning (MTL) networks, revealing spurious correlations among MTL tasks. The MTL networks leverage visual attributes (color, shape, symbol, and text) that we have created for each traffic sign in our dataset. For our distribution shift benchmark, we utilize ImageNet-C's realistic data corruption and natural variation techniques to perform evaluations on the robustness of both base and MTL models. Moreover, we further explore spurious correlations among MTL tasks through synthetic alterations of traffic sign colors using color quantization techniques. Our experiments focus on two major backbones, ResNet-152 and ViT-B/32, and compare the performance between base and MTL models. The VISAT dataset and benchmarking framework contribute to the understanding of model robustness for traffic sign recognition, shedding light on the challenges posed by adversarial attacks and distribution shifts. We believe this work will facilitate advancements in developing more robust models for real-world applications in autonomous driving and cyber-physical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Pre-Padding: Generating Evasive Network Traffic Against Transformer-Based Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25810v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To date, traffic obfuscation techniques have been widely adopted to protect network data privacy and security by obscuring the true patterns of traffic. Nevertheless, as the pre-trained models emerge, especially transformer-based classifiers, existing traffic obfuscation methods become increasingly vulnerable, as witnessed by current studies reporting the traffic classification accuracy up to 99\% or higher. To counter such high-performance transformer-based classification models, we in this paper propose a novel and effective \underline{adv}ersarial \underline{traffic}-generating approach (AdvTraffic\footnote{The code and data are available at: http://xxx}). Our approach has two key innovations: (i) a pre-padding strategy is proposed to modify packets, which effectively overcomes the limitations of existing research against transformer-based models for network traffic classification; and (ii) a reinforcement learning model is employed to optimize network traffic perturbations, aiming to maximize adversarial effectiveness against transformer-based classification models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply adversarial perturbation techniques to defend against transformer-based traffic classifiers. Furthermore, our method can be easily deployed into practical network environments. Finally, multi-faceted experiments are conducted across several real-world datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively undermine transformer-based classifiers, significantly reducing classification accuracy from 99\% to as low as 25.68\%.</p></details> |  |

Traffic was captured using Wireshark, and key metrics (including delay, jitter, bandwidth, and packet loss) were analyzed. Google Drive maintained the most consistent performance across both types of networks, showing low latency and reduced jitter. Dropbox showed efficient bandwidth utilization, but experienced a longer delay over LTE, attributed to a greater number of intermediate hops. OneDrive presented variable behavior, with elevated packet rates and increased sensitivity to fluctuations in the mobile network. A bimodal distribution of packet sizes was observed and modeled using a dual Poisson function. In general, Wi-Fi connections provided greater stability for multimedia transfers, while LTE performance varied depending on platform-specific implementations. The results contribute to a better understanding of traffic behavior in cloud-based storage applications and suggest further analysis with larger datasets and heterogeneous access networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 20th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies (CISTI), Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems</p></details> |

The dataset provides a unique view into global threat activity as observed through scanning and backscatter traffic, key indicators of large-scale probing behavior, data outages, and ongoing denial-of-service (DoS) campaigns. To process this extensive archive, coarse-to-fine methodology is adopted in which general insights are first extracted through a resource-efficient metadata sub-pipeline, followed by a more detailed packet header sub-pipeline for finer-grained analysis. The methodology establishes two sub-pipelines to enable scalable processing of nearly two decades of telescope data and supports multi-level exploration of traffic dynamics. Initial insights highlight long-term trends and recurring traffic spikes, some attributable to Internet-wide scanning events and others likely linked to DoS activities.We present general observations spanning 2006-2024, with a focused analysis of traffic characteristics during 2024.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue a comprehensive methodology is designed to optimize traffic flow and minimize delays. The framework is structured with three primary components: (a) vehicle detection, (b) traffic prediction, and (c) traffic signal optimization. This paper presents the first component, vehicle detection. The methodology involves analyzing multiple sequential frames from a camera feed to compute the background, i.e. the underlying roadway, by averaging pixel values over time. The computed background is then utilized to extract the foreground, where the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is applied to detect vehicles. With its computational efficiency and minimal infrastructure modification requirements, the proposed methodology offers a practical and scalable solution for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

Ensuring the safe release of ADS functions necessitates a precise understanding of the occurring traffic scenarios. To support this objective, this work introduces a pipeline for traffic scenario clustering and the analysis of scenario category completeness. The Clustering Vector Quantized - Variational Autoencoder (CVQ-VAE) is employed for the clustering of highway traffic scenarios and utilized to create various catalogs with differing numbers of traffic scenario categories. Subsequently, the impact of the number of categories on the completeness considerations of the traffic scenario categories is analyzed. The results show an outperforming clustering performance compared to previous work. The trade-off between cluster quality and the amount of required data to maintain completeness is discussed based on the publicly available highD dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[DQ3D: Depth-guided Query for Transformer-Based 3D Object Detection in Traffic Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23144v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D object detection from multi-view images in traffic scenarios has garnered significant attention in recent years. Many existing approaches rely on object queries that are generated from 3D reference points to localize objects. However, a limitation of these methods is that some reference points are often far from the target object, which can lead to false positive detections. In this paper, we propose a depth-guided query generator for 3D object detection (DQ3D) that leverages depth information and 2D detections to ensure that reference points are sampled from the surface or interior of the object. Furthermore, to address partially occluded objects in current frame, we introduce a hybrid attention mechanism that fuses historical detection results with depth-guided queries, thereby forming hybrid queries. Evaluation on the nuScenes dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms the baseline by 6.3\% in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) and 4.3\% in the NuScenes Detection Score (NDS).</p></details> |  |

However, single model approaches often fail to capture the complex, nonlinear, and multi scale temporal patterns in traffic flow data. This study proposes a decomposition driven hybrid framework that integrates Seasonal Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) with three complementary predictive models. STL first decomposes the original time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components. Then, a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network models long term trends, an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model captures seasonal periodicity, and an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm predicts nonlinear residual fluctuations. The final forecast is obtained through multiplicative integration of the sub model predictions. Using 998 traffic flow records from a New York City intersection between November and December 2015, results show that the LSTM ARIMA XGBoost hybrid model significantly outperforms standalone models including LSTM, ARIMA, and XGBoost across MAE, RMSE, and R squared metrics. The decomposition strategy effectively isolates temporal characteristics, allowing each model to specialize, thereby improving prediction accuracy, interpretability, and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Error Adjustment Based on Spatiotemporal Correlation Fusion for Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23656v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) play a significant role in an increasing body of research on traffic forecasting due to their effectively capturing spatiotemporal patterns embedded in traffic data. A general assumption of training the said forecasting models via mean squared error estimation is that the errors across time steps and spatial positions are uncorrelated. However, this assumption does not really hold because of the autocorrelation caused by both the temporality and spatiality of traffic data. This gap limits the performance of DNN-based forecasting models and is overlooked by current studies. To fill up this gap, this paper proposes Spatiotemporally Autocorrelated Error Adjustment (SAEA), a novel and general framework designed to systematically adjust autocorrelated prediction errors in traffic forecasting. Unlike existing approaches that assume prediction errors follow a random Gaussian noise distribution, SAEA models these errors as a spatiotemporal vector autoregressive (VAR) process to capture their intrinsic dependencies. First, it explicitly captures both spatial and temporal error correlations by a coefficient matrix, which is then embedded into a newly formulated cost function. Second, a structurally sparse regularization is introduced to incorporate prior spatial information, ensuring that the learned coefficient matrix aligns with the inherent road network structure. Finally, an inference process with test-time error adjustment is designed to dynamically refine predictions, mitigating the impact of autocorrelated errors in real-time forecasting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified on different traffic datasets. Results across a wide range of traffic forecasting models show that our method enhances performance in almost all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

With the aim of overcoming such limitations, network operators are foreseeing Digital Twins (DTs) as key enablers, which are designed as dynamic and virtual replicas of network infrastructure, allowing operators to model, analyze, and optimize various operations without any risk of affecting the live network. However, for Digital Twin Networks (DTNs) to meet the challenges faced by operators especially in line with resource management, a driving engine is needed. In this paper, an AI (Artificial Intelligence)-driven approach is presented by integrating a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network into the DT framework, aimed at forecasting network traffic patterns and proactively managing resource allocation. Through analytical experiments, the AI-Enabled DT framework demonstrates superior performance benchmarked against baseline methods. Our study concludes that embedding AI capabilities within DTs paves the way for fully autonomous, adaptive, and high-performance network management in future mobile networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 fig...</summary><p>6 figures, 2 Tables, Accepted at IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM) 2025</p></details> |

This approach typically uses a computing cluster managed by a container orchestration platform to deploy microservices. However, this shift introduces significant challenges, particularly in the efficient scheduling of containerized services. These challenges are compounded by unpredictable scenarios such as dynamic incoming workloads with various execution traffic and variable communication delays among cluster nodes. Existing works often overlook the real-time traffic impacts of dynamic requests on running microservices, as well as the varied communication delays across cluster nodes. Consequently, even optimally deployed microservices could suffer from significant performance degradation over time. To address these issues, we propose a network and traffic-aware adaptive scheduling framework, TraDE, which can adaptively redeploy microservice instances to maintain desired performance amid changing traffic and network conditions within the hosting cluster. We have implemented TraDE as an extension to the Kubernetes platform. Additionally, we deployed realistic microservice applications in a real compute cluster and conducted extensive experiments to assess our framework's performance in various scenarios. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of TraDE in rescheduling running microservices to enhance end-to-end performance while maintaining a high goodput ratio. Compared with the existing method NetMARKS, TraDE outperforms it by reducing the average response time of the application by up to 48.3%, and improving the throughput by up to 1.2-1.5x across workloads while maintaining a goodput ratio of 95.36%, and showing robust adaptive capability to meet QoS targets under sustained workloads and dynamic networking conditions.</p></details> | 13 pages |

However, the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution inherent in fisheye imagery introduce substantial challenges for standard object detectors, particularly near image boundaries where object appearance is severely degraded. In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate robustly under these conditions. Our approach employs a simple yet effective pre and post processing pipeline that enhances detection consistency across the image, especially in regions affected by severe distortion. We train several state-of-the-art detection models on the fisheye traffic imagery and combine their outputs through an ensemble strategy to improve overall detection accuracy. Our method achieves an F1 score of0.6366 on the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 4, placing 8thoverall out of 62 teams. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing issues inherent to fisheye imagery.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was accepted at ICCV 2025 and published in CVF database</p></details> |
| **[From Optimization to Prediction: Transformer-Based Path-Flow Estimation to the Traffic Assignment Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19889v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The traffic assignment problem is essential for traffic flow analysis, traditionally solved using mathematical programs under the Equilibrium principle. These methods become computationally prohibitive for large-scale networks due to non-linear growth in complexity with the number of OD pairs. This study introduces a novel data-driven approach using deep neural networks, specifically leveraging the Transformer architecture, to predict equilibrium path flows directly. By focusing on path-level traffic distribution, the proposed model captures intricate correlations between OD pairs, offering a more detailed and flexible analysis compared to traditional link-level approaches. The Transformer-based model drastically reduces computation time, while adapting to changes in demand and network structure without the need for recalculation. Numerical experiments are conducted on the Manhattan-like synthetic network, the Sioux Falls network, and the Eastern-Massachusetts network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is orders of magnitude faster than conventional optimization. It efficiently estimates path-level traffic flows in multi-class networks, reducing computational costs and improving prediction accuracy by capturing detailed trip and flow information. The model also adapts flexibly to varying demand and network conditions, supporting traffic management and enabling rapid `what-if' analyses for enhanced transportation planning and policy-making.</p></details> |  |

Compared with traditional reinforcement learning and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers three main advantages: zero-shot generalization, transferring unchanged to new road networks and out-of-distribution incidents by leveraging internal traffic-control policies and reasoning; a compact 3B-parameter design that supports real-time inference on mobile-class chips for edge deployment; and an explainable TSC process that enables multi-intersection coordination through communication and an asynchronous communication network. Extensive benchmarks show Traffic-R1 outperforms strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In production, the model now manages signals affecting over 55,000 drivers daily, reduces average queue lengths by more than 5%, and halves operator workload.

| **[Securing IoT Communications via Anomaly Traffic Detection: Synergy of Genetic Algorithm and Ensemble Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19121v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed industries by enabling seamless data exchange among connected devices. However, IoT networks remain vulnerable to security threats such as denial of service (DoS) attacks, anomalous traffic, and data manipulation due to decentralized architectures and limited resources. To address these issues, this paper proposes an advanced anomaly detection framework with three main phases. First, data preprocessing is performed using the Median KS Test to remove noise, handle missing values, and balance datasets for cleaner input. Second, a feature selection phase employs a Genetic Algorithm combined with eagle inspired search strategies to identify the most relevant features, reduce dimensionality, and improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, an ensemble classifier integrates Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms to achieve accurate and reliable anomaly detection. The proposed model demonstrates high adaptability and scalability across diverse IoT environments. Experimental results show that it outperforms existing methods by achieving 98 percent accuracy, 95 percent detection rate, and reductions in false positive (10 percent) and false negative (5 percent) rates. These results confirm the framework effectiveness and robustness in improving IoT network security against evolving cyber threats.</p></details> | 24 pages |

Using a metric for discoverability, we model the ability of defenders to measure Crackonosh traffic as the malware population decreases, evaluate the strength of various detection methods, and demonstrate how different darkspace sizes affect both the ability to track the malware, but enable emergent behaviors by exploiting attacker mistakes.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Interval Prediction of Annual Average Daily Traffic on Local Roads via Quantile Random Forest with High-Dimensional Spatial Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18548v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate annual average daily traffic (AADT) data are vital for transport planning and infrastructure management. However, automatic traffic detectors across national road networks often provide incomplete coverage, leading to underrepresentation of minor roads. While recent machine learning advances have improved AADT estimation at unmeasured locations, most models produce only point predictions and overlook estimation uncertainty. This study addresses that gap by introducing an interval prediction approach that explicitly quantifies predictive uncertainty. We integrate a Quantile Random Forest model with Principal Component Analysis to generate AADT prediction intervals, providing plausible traffic ranges bounded by estimated minima and maxima. Using data from over 2,000 minor roads in England and Wales, and evaluated with specialized interval metrics, the proposed method achieves an interval coverage probability of 88.22%, a normalized average width of 0.23, and a Winkler Score of 7,468.47. By combining machine learning with spatial and high-dimensional analysis, this framework enhances both the accuracy and interpretability of AADT estimation, supporting more robust and informed transport planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing 5G V2X Mode 2 for Sporadic Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17395v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emerging road safety and autonomous vehicle applications require timely and reliable data delivery between vehicles and between vehicles and infrastructure. To satisfy this demand, 3GPP develops a 5G Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology. Depending on the served traffic type, 5G V2X specifications propose two channel access methods: (i) Mode 1, according to which a base station allocates resources to users, and (ii) Mode 2, according to which users autonomously select resources for their transmissions. In the paper, we consider a scenario with sporadic traffic, e.g., a vehicle generates a packet at a random time moment when it detects a dangerous situation, which imposes strict requirements on delay and reliability. To satisfy strict delay requirements, vehicles use Mode 2. We analyze the performance of Mode 2 for sporadic traffic and propose several approaches to improve it. Simulation results show that the proposed approaches can increase the system capacity by up to 40% with a low impact on complexity.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose FlowDet, a high-speed detector featuring a decoupled encoder optimization strategy applied to the DETR architecture. Specifically, FlowDet employs a novel Geometric Deformable Unit (GDU) for traffic-aware geometric modeling and a Scale-Aware Attention (SAA) module to maintain high representational power across extreme scale variations. To rigorously evaluate the model's performance in environments with severe occlusion and high object density, we collected the Intersection-Flow-5k dataset, a new challenging scene for this task. Evaluated on Intersection-Flow-5k, FlowDet establishes a new state-of-the-art. Compared to the strong RT-DETR baseline, it improves AP(test) by 1.5% and AP50(test) by 1.6%, while simultaneously reducing GFLOPs by 63.2% and increasing inference speed by 16.2%. Our work demonstrates a new path towards building highly efficient and accurate detectors for demanding, real-world perception systems.

Since each node in such environments generates various types of data with diverse service requirements, MAC protocol holds crucial importance to ensure efficient delivery. In this context, simple to complex MAC schemes are found in literature. This paper focuses on evaluating the performance of two major techniques "slot stealing" and "packet fragmentation" for the IIoT; representative protocols SS-MAC and FROG-MAC have been chosen from each category respectively. We conducted realistic simulations for the two protocols using Contiki. Delay and packet loss comparison for SS-MAC and FROG-MAC indicates the superiority of FROG-MAC due to reduction in the waiting time for urgent traffic. Thus, a simple fragmentation scheme could be deployed for efficient scheduling of heterogenous traffic in the industrial environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smart Traffic Signals: Comparing MARL and Fixed-Time Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14544v3)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban traffic congestion, particularly at intersections, significantly impacts travel time, fuel consumption, and emissions. Traditional fixed-time signal control systems often lack the adaptability to manage dynamic traffic patterns effectively. This study explores the application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to optimize traffic signal coordination across multiple intersections within a simulated environment. Utilizing Pygame, a simulation was developed to model a network of interconnected intersections with randomly generated vehicle flows to reflect realistic traffic variability. A decentralized MARL controller was implemented, in which each traffic signal operates as an autonomous agent, making decisions based on local observations and information from neighboring agents. Performance was evaluated against a baseline fixed-time controller using metrics such as average vehicle wait time and overall throughput. The MARL approach demonstrated statistically significant improvements, including reduced average waiting times and improved throughput. These findings suggest that MARL-based dynamic control strategies hold substantial promise for improving urban traffic management efficiency. More research is recommended to address scalability and real-world implementation challenges.</p></details> |  |

Traffic signaling is a key component in effective traffic management for such situations, but the advancements in intelligent traffic signaling have been exclusive to developed countries with structured traffic. The non-lane-based, heterogeneous traffic of Dhaka City requires a contextual approach. This study focuses on the development of an intelligent traffic signaling system feasible in the context of developing countries such as Bangladesh. We propose a pipeline leveraging Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) feeds, a low resources system Raspberry Pi 4B processing, and a state of the art YOLO-based object detection model trained on the Non-lane-based and Heterogeneous Traffic (NHT-1071) dataset to detect and classify heterogeneous traffic. A multi-objective optimization algorithm, NSGA-II, then generates optimized signal timings, minimizing waiting time while maximizing vehicle throughput. We test our implementation in a five-road intersection at Palashi, Dhaka, demonstrating the potential to significantly improve traffic management in similar situations. The developed testbed paves the way for more contextual and effective Intelligent Traffic Signaling (ITS) solutions for developing areas with complicated traffic dynamics such as Dhaka City.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS)</p></details> |

The key to building a logically centralized but physically distributed control-plane is running diverse cluster management protocols to achieve consistency through an exchange of control traffic. Meanwhile, we observe that the control traffic exposes unique time-series patterns and directional relationships due to the operational structure even though the traffic is encrypted, and this pattern can disclose confidential information such as control-plane topology and protocol dependencies, which can be exploited for severe attacks. With this insight, we propose a new SD-WAN fingerprinting system, called Heimdallr. It analyzes periodical and operational patterns of SD-WAN cluster management protocols and the context of flow directions from the collected control traffic utilizing a deep learning-based approach, so that it can classify the cluster management protocols automatically from miscellaneous control traffic datasets. Our evaluation, which is performed in a realistic SD-WAN environment consisting of geographically distant three campus networks and one enterprise network shows that Heimdallr can classify SD-WAN control traffic with $\geq$ 93%, identify individual protocols with $\geq$ 80% macro F-1 scores, and finally can infer control-plane topology with $\geq$ 70% similarity.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Hypergame-based Cognition Modeling and Intention Interpretation for Human-Driven Vehicles in Connected Mixed Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15573v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the practical implementation of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), the traffic system is expected to remain a mix of CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs) for the foreseeable future. To enhance safety and traffic efficiency, the trajectory planning strategies of CAVs must account for the influence of HVs, necessitating accurate HV trajectory prediction. Current research often assumes that human drivers have perfect knowledge of all vehicles' objectives, an unrealistic premise. This paper bridges the gap by leveraging hypergame theory to account for cognitive and perception limitations in HVs. We model human bounded rationality without assuming them to be merely passive followers and propose a hierarchical cognition modeling framework that captures cognitive relationships among vehicles. We further analyze the cognitive stability of the system, proving that the strategy profile where all vehicles adopt cognitively equilibrium strategies constitutes a hyper Nash equilibrium when CAVs accurately learn HV parameters. To achieve this, we develop an inverse learning algorithm for distributed intention interpretation via vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, which extends the framework to both offline and online scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a distributed trajectory prediction and planning approach for CAVs, leveraging the learned parameters in real time. Simulations in highway lane-changing scenarios demonstrate the proposed method's accuracy in parameter learning, robustness to noisy trajectory observations, and safety in HV trajectory prediction. The results validate the effectiveness of our method in both offline and online implementations.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods - ranging from rule-based heuristics to reinforcement learning (RL) - often struggle to generalize to complex, dynamic, and safety-critical scenarios. We introduce VLMLight, a novel TSC framework that integrates vision-language meta-control with dual-branch reasoning. At the core of VLMLight is the first image-based traffic simulator that enables multi-view visual perception at intersections, allowing policies to reason over rich cues such as vehicle type, motion, and spatial density. A large language model (LLM) serves as a safety-prioritized meta-controller, selecting between a fast RL policy for routine traffic and a structured reasoning branch for critical cases. In the latter, multiple LLM agents collaborate to assess traffic phases, prioritize emergency vehicles, and verify rule compliance. Experiments show that VLMLight reduces waiting times for emergency vehicles by up to 65% over RL-only systems, while preserving real-time performance in standard conditions with less than 1% degradation. VLMLight offers a scalable, interpretable, and safety-aware solution for next-generation traffic signal control.</p></details> | 25 pages, 15 figures |

Despite substantial progress in imputation models, model selection and development for practical applications remains challenging due to three key gaps: 1) the absence of a model taxonomy for traffic data imputation to trace the technological development and highlight their distinct features. 2) the lack of unified benchmarking pipeline for fair and reproducible model evaluation across standardized traffic datasets. 3) insufficient in-depth analysis that jointly compare models across multiple dimensions, including effectiveness, computational efficiency and robustness. To this end, this paper proposes practice-oriented taxonomies for traffic data missing patterns and imputation models, systematically cataloging real-world traffic data loss scenarios and analyzing the characteristics of existing models. We further introduce a unified benchmarking pipeline to comprehensively evaluate 11 representative models across various missing patterns and rates, assessing overall performance, performance under challenging scenarios, computational efficiency, and providing visualizations. This work aims to provide a holistic perspective on traffic data imputation and to serve as a practical guideline for model selection and application in intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Intention-driven Lane Change Framework Considering Heterogeneous Dynamic Cooperation in Mixed-traffic Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22550v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In mixed-traffic environments, where autonomous vehicles (AVs) interact with diverse human-driven vehicles (HVs), unpredictable intentions and heterogeneous behaviors make safe and efficient lane change maneuvers highly challenging. Existing methods often oversimplify these interactions by assuming uniform patterns. We propose an intention-driven lane change framework that integrates driving-style recognition, cooperation-aware decision-making, and coordinated motion planning. A deep learning classifier trained on the NGSIM dataset identifies human driving styles in real time. A cooperation score with intrinsic and interactive components estimates surrounding drivers' intentions and quantifies their willingness to cooperate with the ego vehicle. Decision-making combines behavior cloning with inverse reinforcement learning to determine whether a lane change should be initiated. For trajectory generation, model predictive control is integrated with IRL-based intention inference to produce collision-free and socially compliant maneuvers. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves 94.2\% accuracy and 94.3\% F1-score, outperforming rule-based and learning-based baselines by 4-15\% in lane change recognition. These results highlight the benefit of modeling inter-driver heterogeneity and demonstrate the potential of the framework to advance context-aware and human-like autonomous driving in complex traffic environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[HOB: A Holistically Optimized Bidding Strategy under Heterogeneous Auction Mechanisms with Organic Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15238v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The E-commerce advertising platforms typically sell commercial traffic through either second-price auction (SPA) or first-price auction (FPA). SPA was historically prevalent due to its dominant strategy incentive-compatible (DSIC) for bidders with quasi-linear utilities, especially when budgets are not a binding constraint, while FPA has gained more prominence for offering higher revenue potential to publishers and avoiding the possibility for discriminatory treatment in personalized reserve prices. Meanwhile, on the demand side, advertisers are increasingly adopting platform-wide marketing solutions akin to QuanZhanTui, shifting from spending budgets solely on commercial traffic to bidding on the entire traffic for the purpose of maximizing overall sales. For automated bidding systems, such a trend poses a critical challenge: determining optimal strategies across heterogeneous auction channels to fulfill diverse advertiser objectives, such as maximizing return (MaxReturn) or meeting target return on ad spend (TargetROAS). To overcome this challenge, this work makes two key contributions. First, we derive an efficient solution for optimal bidding under FPA channels, which takes into account the presence of organic traffic - traffic can be won for free. Second, we introduce a marginal cost alignment (MCA) strategy that provably secures bidding efficiency across heterogeneous auction mechanisms. To validate performance of our developed framework, we conduct comprehensive offline experiments on public datasets and large-scale online A/B testing, which demonstrate consistent improvements over existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatiotemporal Traffic Prediction in Distributed Backend Systems via Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15215v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of traffic prediction in distributed backend systems and proposes a graph neural network based modeling approach to overcome the limitations of traditional models in capturing complex dependencies and dynamic features. The system is abstracted as a graph with nodes and edges, where node features represent traffic and resource states, and adjacency relations describe service interactions. A graph convolution mechanism enables multi order propagation and aggregation of node features, while a gated recurrent structure models historical sequences dynamically, thus integrating spatial structures with temporal evolution. A spatiotemporal joint modeling module further fuses graph representation with temporal dependency, and a decoder generates future traffic predictions. The model is trained with mean squared error to minimize deviations from actual values. Experiments based on public distributed system logs construct combined inputs of node features, topology, and sequences, and compare the proposed method with mainstream baselines using MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. Results show that the proposed method achieves stable performance and low error across different prediction horizons and model depths, significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of traffic forecasting in distributed backend systems and verifying the potential of graph neural networks in complex system modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[FUSE-Traffic: Fusion of Unstructured and Structured Data for Event-aware Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16053v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate traffic forecasting is a core technology for building Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), enabling better urban resource allocation and improved travel experiences. With growing urbanization, traffic congestion has intensified, highlighting the need for reliable and responsive forecasting models. In recent years, deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), has emerged as the mainstream paradigm in traffic forecasting. GNNs can effectively capture complex spatial dependencies in road network topology and dynamic temporal evolution patterns in traffic flow data. Foundational models such as STGCN and GraphWaveNet, along with more recent developments including STWave and D2STGNN, have achieved impressive performance on standard traffic datasets. These approaches incorporate sophisticated graph convolutional structures and temporal modeling mechanisms, demonstrating particular effectiveness in capturing and forecasting traffic patterns characterized by periodic regularities. To address this challenge, researchers have explored various ways to incorporate event information. Early attempts primarily relied on manually engineered event features. For instance, some approaches introduced manually defined incident effect scores or constructed specific subgraphs for different event-induced traffic conditions. While these methods somewhat enhance responsiveness to specific events, their core drawback lies in a heavy reliance on domain experts' prior knowledge, making generalization to diverse and complex unknown events difficult, and low-dimensional manual features often lead to the loss of rich semantic details.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hard-Label Black-Box Evasion Attack against ML-based Malicious Traffic Detection Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14906v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Learning (ML)-based malicious traffic detection is a promising security paradigm. It outperforms rule-based traditional detection by identifying various advanced attacks. However, the robustness of these ML models is largely unexplored, thereby allowing attackers to craft adversarial traffic examples that evade detection. Existing evasion attacks typically rely on overly restrictive conditions (e.g., encrypted protocols, Tor, or specialized setups), or require detailed prior knowledge of the target (e.g., training data and model parameters), which is impractical in realistic black-box scenarios. The feasibility of a hard-label black-box evasion attack (i.e., applicable across diverse tasks and protocols without internal target insights) thus remains an open challenge. To this end, we develop NetMasquerade, which leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to manipulate attack flows to mimic benign traffic and evade detection. Specifically, we establish a tailored pre-trained model called Traffic-BERT, utilizing a network-specialized tokenizer and an attention mechanism to extract diverse benign traffic patterns. Subsequently, we integrate Traffic-BERT into the RL framework, allowing NetMasquerade to effectively manipulate malicious packet sequences based on benign traffic patterns with minimal modifications. Experimental results demonstrate that NetMasquerade enables both brute-force and stealthy attacks to evade 6 existing detection methods under 80 attack scenarios, achieving over 96.65% attack success rate. Notably, it can evade the methods that are either empirically or certifiably robust against existing evasion attacks. Finally, NetMasquerade achieves low-latency adversarial traffic generation, demonstrating its practicality in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Widely used IDM agents simply follow a lead vehicle and cannot react to vehicles in adjacent lanes, hindering tests of complex interaction capabilities. We address this issue by integrating the state-of-the-art learned traffic agent model SMART into nuPlan. Thus, we are the first to evaluate planners under more realistic conditions and quantify how conclusions shift when narrowing the sim-to-real gap. Our analysis covers 14 recent planners and established baselines and shows that IDM-based simulation overestimates planning performance: nearly all scores deteriorate. In contrast, many planners interact better than previously assumed and even improve in multi-lane, interaction-heavy scenarios like lane changes or turns. Methods trained in closed-loop demonstrate the best and most stable driving performance. However, when reaching their limits in augmented edge-case scenarios, all learned planners degrade abruptly, whereas rule-based planners maintain reasonable basic behavior. Based on our results, we suggest SMART-reactive simulation as a new standard closed-loop benchmark in nuPlan and release the SMART agents as a drop-in alternative to IDM at https://github.com/shgd95/InteractiveClosedLoop.</p></details> |  |

These attacks typically rely on conspicuous stickers and projections, or using invisible light and acoustic signals that can be easily blocked. In this paper, we introduce a novel attack medium, i.e., fluorescent ink, to design a stealthy and effective physical adversarial patch, namely FIPatch, to advance the state-of-the-art. Specifically, we first model the fluorescence effect in the digital domain to identify the optimal attack settings, which guide the real-world fluorescence parameters. By applying a carefully designed fluorescence perturbation to the target sign, the attacker can later trigger a fluorescent effect using invisible ultraviolet light, causing the TSR system to misclassify the sign and potentially leading to traffic accidents. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation to investigate the effectiveness of FIPatch, which shows a success rate of 98.31% in low-light conditions. Furthermore, our attack successfully bypasses five popular defenses and achieves a success rate of 96.72%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stability and Heavy-traffic Delay Optimality of General Load Balancing Policies in Heterogeneous Service Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14284v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a load balancing system consisting of $n$ single-server queues working in parallel, with heterogeneous service rates. Jobs arrive to a central dispatcher, which has to dispatch them to one of the queues immediately upon arrival. For this setting, we consider a broad family of policies where the dispatcher can only access the queue lengths sporadically, every $T$ units of time. We assume that the dispatching decisions are made based only on the order of the scaled queue lengths at the last time that the queues were accessed, and on the processing rate of each server. For these general policies, we provide easily verifiable necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of the system, and sufficient conditions for heavy-traffic delay optimality. We also show that, in heavy-traffic, the queue length converges in distribution to a scaled deterministic vector, where the scaling factor is an exponential random variable.</p></details> |  |
| **[An LLM-Powered AI Agent Framework for Holistic IoT Traffic Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13925v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Internet of Things (IoT) networks generate diverse and high-volume traffic that reflects both normal activity and potential threats. Deriving meaningful insight from such telemetry requires cross-layer interpretation of behaviors, protocols, and context rather than isolated detection. This work presents an LLM-powered AI agent framework that converts raw packet captures into structured and semantically enriched representations for interactive analysis. The framework integrates feature extraction, transformer-based anomaly detection, packet and flow summarization, threat intelligence enrichment, and retrieval-augmented question answering. An AI agent guided by a large language model performs reasoning over the indexed traffic artifacts, assembling evidence to produce accurate and human-readable interpretations. Experimental evaluation on multiple IoT captures and six open models shows that hybrid retrieval, which combines lexical and semantic search with reranking, substantially improves BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore results compared with dense-only retrieval. System profiling further indicates low CPU, GPU, and memory overhead, demonstrating that the framework achieves holistic and efficient interpretation of IoT network traffic.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory-based real-time pedestrian crash prediction at intersections: A novel non-linear link function for block maxima led Bayesian GEV framework addressing heterogeneous traffic condition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12963v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study develops a real-time framework for estimating pedestrian crash risk at signalized intersections under heterogeneous, non-lane-based traffic. Existing approaches often assume linear relationships between covariates and parameters, oversimplifying the complex, non-monotonic interactions among different road users. To overcome this, the framework introduces a non-linear link function within a Bayesian generalized extreme value (GEV) structure to capture traffic variability more accurately. The framework applies extreme value theory through the block maxima approach using post-encroachment time as a surrogate safety measure. A hierarchical Bayesian model incorporating both linear and non-linear link functions into GEV parameters is estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation. It also introduces a behavior-normalized Modified Crash Risk (MRC) formula to account for pedestrians' habitual risk-taking behavior. Seven Bayesian hierarchical models were developed and compared using deviance information criterion. Models employing non-linear link functions for the location and scale parameters significantly outperformed their linear counterparts. The results revealed that pedestrian speed has a negative relationship with crash risk, while flow and speed of motorized vehicles, pedestrian flow, and non-motorized vehicles conflicting speed contribute positively. The MRC formulation reduced overestimation and provided crash predictions with 93% confidence. The integration of non-linear link functions enhances model flexibility, capturing the non-linear nature of traffic extremes. The proposed MRC metric aligns crash risk estimates with real-world pedestrian behavior in mixed-traffic environments. This framework offers a practical analytical tool for traffic engineers and planners to design adaptive signal control and pedestrian safety interventions before crashes occur.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is a preprint and has not yet been peer-reviewed.

| **[Metronome: Efficient Scheduling for Periodic Traffic Jobs with Network and Priority Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12274v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth in computing power demand, cloud native networks have emerged as a promising solution to address the challenges of efficient resource coordination, particularly in coping with the dynamic fluctuations of network bandwidth in clusters. We propose Metronome, a network-aware and priority-aware scheduling mechanism for cloud native networks. This mechanism is designed to support jobs that exhibit periodic traffic patterns and dynamic bandwidth demands, particularly in the context of distributed training. Specifically, Metronome employs a time-division multiplexing approach that leverages job traffic characteristics to construct an elastic network resource allocation model, enabling efficient bandwidth sharing across multiple jobs. In addition, it incorporates a multi-objective optimization strategy, jointly considering latency and job priorities to achieve globally optimal as well as dynamic resource allocation. Finally, Metronome adapts to the dynamic environment by monitoring the cluster and performing reconfiguration operations. Extensive experiments with 13 common machine learning models demonstrate that Metronome can enhance cluster resource utilization while guaranteeing service performance. Compared with the existing Kubernetes scheduling mechanisms across multiple scenarios, Metronome reduces job completion time by up to 19.50% while improving average bandwidth utilization by up to 23.20%.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 16 figures.

| **[Stable and Fault-Tolerant Decentralized Traffic Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11937v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud providers have recently decentralized their wide-area network traffic engineering (TE) systems to contain the impact of TE controller failures. In the decentralized design, a controller fault only impacts its slice of the network, limiting the blast radius to a fraction of the network. However, we find that autonomous slice controllers can arrive at divergent traffic allocations that overload links by 30% beyond their capacity. We present Symphony, a decentralized TE system that addresses the challenge of divergence-induced congestion while preserving the fault-isolation benefits of decentralization. By augmenting TE objectives with quadratic regularization, Symphony makes traffic allocations robust to demand perturbations, ensuring TE controllers naturally converge to compatible allocations without coordination. In parallel, Symphony's randomized slicing algorithm partitions the network to minimize blast radius by distributing critical traffic sources across slices, preventing any single failure from becoming catastrophic. These innovations work in tandem: regularization ensures algorithmic stability to traffic allocations while intelligent slicing provides architectural resilience in the network. Through extensive evaluation on cloud provider WANs, we show Symphony reduces divergence-induced congestion by 14x and blast radius by 79% compared to current practice.</p></details> | 19 pages, 23 figures |

In this work, we present a unique dual-model framework that strategically utilizes the complementary strengths of VideoLLaMA and Qwen2.5-VL through task-specific optimization to address this issue. The core insight behind our approach is that separating training for captioning and visual question answering (VQA) tasks minimizes task interference and allows each model to specialize more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that VideoLLaMA is particularly effective in temporal reasoning, achieving a CIDEr score of 1.1001, while Qwen2.5-VL excels in visual understanding with a VQA accuracy of 60.80\%. Through extensive experiments on the WTS dataset, our method achieves an S2 score of 45.7572 in the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 2, placing 10th on the challenge leaderboard. Ablation studies validate that our separate training strategy outperforms joint training by 8.6\% in VQA accuracy while maintaining captioning quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Lightweight CNN-Based Wi-Fi Intrusion Detection Using 2D Traffic Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11898v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wi-Fi networks are ubiquitous in both home and enterprise environments, serving as a primary medium for Internet access and forming the backbone of modern IoT ecosystems. However, their inherent vulnerabilities, combined with widespread adoption, create opportunities for malicious actors to gain unauthorized access or compromise sensitive data stored on connected devices. To address these challenges, we propose a deep learning based network intrusion detection system (NIDS) for Wi-Fi environments. Building on our previous work, we convert network traffic into two-dimensional data representations and use them to train DL models based on convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. We implement five distinct techniques for generating the two-dimensional representations, and to ensure low detection latency, we adopt lightweight CNN architectures in our NIDS. The models are trained using the AWID3 dataset, a publicly available benchmark for Wi-Fi NIDS research, and are evaluated for both binary and multi-class classification tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive detection performance with low inference time, making it suitable for real-world Wi-Fi deployment scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, existing data-driven simulators face two key challenges: a limited focus on modeling dense, heterogeneous interactions at urban intersections - which are prevalent, crucial, and practically significant in countries like China, featuring diverse agents including motorized vehicles (MVs), non-motorized vehicles (NMVs), and pedestrians - and the inherent difficulty in robustly learning high-dimensional joint distributions for such high-density scenes, often leading to mode collapse and long-term simulation instability. We introduce City Crossings Dataset (CiCross), a large-scale dataset collected from a real-world urban intersection, uniquely capturing dense, heterogeneous multi-agent interactions, particularly with a substantial proportion of MVs, NMVs and pedestrians. Based on this dataset, we propose IntersectioNDE (Intersection Naturalistic Driving Environment), a data-driven simulator tailored for complex urban intersection scenarios. Its core component is the Interaction Decoupling Strategy (IDS), a training paradigm that learns compositional dynamics from agent subsets, enabling the marginal-to-joint simulation. Integrated into a scene-aware Transformer network with specialized training techniques, IDS significantly enhances simulation robustness and long-term stability for modeling heterogeneous interactions. Experiments on CiCross show that IntersectioNDE outperforms baseline methods in simulation fidelity, stability, and its ability to replicate complex, distribution-level urban traffic dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ITSC 2025</p></details> |

While researchers have made progress using BERT and Graph Neural Networks, the full potential of advanced language models in understanding complex language patterns remains unexplored. We introduce DESS, a new approach that builds upon previous work by integrating DeBERTa's enhanced attention mechanism to better understand context and relationships in text. Our framework maintains a dual-channel structure, where DeBERTa works alongside an LSTM channel to process both meaning and grammatical patterns in text. We have carefully refined how these components work together, paying special attention to how different types of language information interact. When we tested DESS on standard datasets, it showed meaningful improvements over current methods, with F1-score increases of 4.85, 8.36, and 2.42 in identifying aspect opinion pairs and determining sentiment accurately. Looking deeper into the results, we found that DeBERTa's sophisticated attention system helps DESS handle complicated sentence structures better, especially when important words are far apart. Our findings suggest that upgrading to more advanced language models when thoughtfully integrated, can lead to real improvements in how well we can analyze sentiments in text. The implementation of our approach is publicly available at: https://github.com/VishalRepos/DESS.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 2 figures.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in this setting. However, traditional statically-provisioned GNN inference architectures fall short in meeting two crucial demands of intrusion detection: (1) maintaining consistently low detection latency, and (2) handling highly irregular and bursty workloads. To holistically address these challenges, we present GraphFaaS, a serverless architecture tailored for GNN-based intrusion detection. GraphFaaS leverages the elasticity and agility of serverless computing to dynamically scale the GNN inference pipeline. We parallelize and adapt GNN workflows to a serverless environment, ensuring that the system can respond in real time to fluctuating workloads. By decoupling compute resources from static provisioning, GraphFaaS delivers stable inference latency, which is critical for dependable intrusion detection and timely incident response in cybersecurity operations. Preliminary evaluation shows GraphFaaS reduces average detection latency by 85% and coefficient of variation (CV) by 64% compared to the baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ML For Systems workshop at Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Enhanced Structured Lasso Pruning with Class-wise Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09125v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern applications require lightweight neural network models. Most existing neural network pruning methods focus on removing unimportant filters; however, these may result in the loss of statistical information after pruning due to failing to consider the class-wise information. In this paper, we employ the structured lasso from the perspective of utilizing precise class-wise information for model pruning with the help of Information Bottleneck theory, which guides us to ensure the retention of statistical information before and after pruning. With these techniques, we propose two novel adaptive network pruning schemes in parallel: sparse graph-structured lasso pruning with Information Bottleneck (sGLP-IB) and sparse tree-guided lasso pruning with Information Bottleneck (sTLP-IB). The key component is that we prune the model filters utilizing sGLP-IB and sTLP-IB with more precise structured class-wise relatedness. Compared to multiple state-of-the-art methods, our approaches achieve the best performance across three datasets and six model structures on extensive experiments. For example, with the VGG16 model based on the CIFAR-10 dataset, we can reduce the parameters by 85%, decrease the FLOPs by 61%, and maintain an accuracy of 94.10% (0.14% better than the original). For large-scale ImageNet, we can reduce the parameters by 55% while keeping the accuracy at 76.12% (only drop 0.03%) using the ResNet architecture. In summary, we succeed in reducing the model size and computational resource usage while maintaining the effectiveness of accuracy.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

We draw interest in (i) Machine Learning methods currently utilized for uncovering unknown model structures adaptable to the task of strategic opponent modeling, and (ii) the integration of these methods with Game Theoretic concepts that avoid relying on assumptions often invalid in real-world scenarios, such as the Common Prior Assumption (CPA) and the Self-Interest Hypothesis (SIH). We analyze the ability to handle uncertainty and heterogeneity, two characteristics that are very common in real-world application cases, as well as scalability. As a potential answer to effectively modeling relationships and interactions in multiagent settings, we champion the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Such approaches are designed to operate upon graph-structured data, and have been shown to be a very powerful tool for performing tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Next, we review the domain of Reinforcement Learning (RL), and in particular that of Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL). Following, we describe existing relevant game theoretic solution concepts and consider properties such as fairness and stability. Our review comes complete with a note on the literature that utilizes PTM in domains other than that of document analysis and classification. The capability of PTM to estimate unknown underlying distributions can help with tackling heterogeneity and unknown agent beliefs. Finally, we identify certain open challenges specifically, the need to (i) fit non-stationary environments, (ii) balance the degrees of stability and adaptation, (iii) tackle uncertainty and heterogeneity, (iv) guarantee scalability and solution tractability.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[On Stealing Graph Neural Network Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07170v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current graph neural network (GNN) model-stealing methods rely heavily on queries to the victim model, assuming no hard query limits. However, in reality, the number of allowed queries can be severely limited. In this paper, we demonstrate how an adversary can extract a GNN with very limited interactions with the model. Our approach first enables the adversary to obtain the model backbone without making direct queries to the victim model and then to strategically utilize a fixed query limit to extract the most informative data. The experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack, even under a very restricted query limit and under defense against model extraction in place. Our findings underscore the need for robust defenses against GNN model extraction threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Our method employs a GPU-resident, bin-partitioned approach with full gradient-flow support and adaptive parameter tuning, significantly enhancing both computational and memory efficiency. Benchmarking demonstrates that FastGraph achieves a 20-40x speedup over state-of-the-art libraries such as FAISS, ANNOY, and SCANN in dimensions less than 10 with virtually no memory overhead. These improvements directly translate into substantial performance gains for GNN-based workflows, particularly benefiting computationally intensive applications in low dimensions such as particle clustering in high-energy physics, visual object tracking, and graph clustering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient quantification on large-scale networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15267v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network quantification (NQ) is the problem of estimating the proportions of nodes belonging to each class in subsets of unlabelled graph nodes. When prior probability shift is at play, this task cannot be effectively addressed by first classifying the nodes and then counting the class predictions. In addition, unlike non-relational quantification, NQ demands enhanced flexibility in order to capture a broad range of connectivity patterns, resilience to the challenge of heterophily, and scalability to large networks. In order to meet these stringent requirements, we introduce XNQ, a novel method that synergizes the flexibility and efficiency of the unsupervised node embeddings computed by randomized recursive Graph Neural Networks, with an Expectation-Maximization algorithm that provides a robust quantification-aware adjustment to the output probabilities of a calibrated node classifier. In an extensive evaluation, in which we also validate the design choices underpinning XNQ through comprehensive ablation experiments, we find that XNQ consistently and significantly improves on the best network quantification methods to date, thereby setting the new state of the art for this challenging task. XNQ also provides a training speed-up of up to 10x-100x over other methods based on graph learning.</p></details> | Published version |
| **[Enhancing Logical Expressiveness in Graph Neural Networks via Path-Neighbor Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07994v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) can effectively model structural information of graphs, making them widely used in knowledge graph (KG) reasoning. However, existing studies on the expressive power of GNNs mainly focuses on simple single-relation graphs, and there is still insufficient discussion on the power of GNN to express logical rules in KGs. How to enhance the logical expressive power of GNNs is still a key issue. Motivated by this, we propose Path-Neighbor enhanced GNN (PN-GNN), a method to enhance the logical expressive power of GNN by aggregating node-neighbor embeddings on the reasoning path. First, we analyze the logical expressive power of existing GNN-based methods and point out the shortcomings of the expressive power of these methods. Then, we theoretically investigate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN, showing that it not only has strictly stronger expressive power than C-GNN but also that its $(k+1)$-hop logical expressiveness is strictly superior to that of $k$-hop. Finally, we evaluate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN on six synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments confirm that PN-GNN enhances the expressive power of logical rules without compromising generalization, as evidenced by its competitive performance in KG reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[DarkFarseer: Robust Spatio-temporal Kriging under Graph Sparsity and Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02808v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of the Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems, widespread sensor deployment has become essential. However, the high costs of building sensor networks limit their scale and coverage, making fine-grained deployment challenging. Inductive Spatio-Temporal Kriging (ISK) addresses this issue by introducing virtual sensors. Based on graph neural networks (GNNs) extracting the relationships between physical and virtual sensors, ISK can infer the measurements of virtual sensors from physical sensors. However, current ISK methods rely on conventional message-passing mechanisms and network architectures, without effectively extracting spatio-temporal features of physical sensors and focusing on representing virtual sensors. Additionally, existing graph construction methods face issues of sparse and noisy connections, destroying ISK performance. To address these issues, we propose DarkFarseer, a novel ISK framework with three key components. First, we propose the Neighbor Hidden Style Enhancement module with a style transfer strategy to enhance the representation of virtual nodes in a temporal-then-spatial manner to better extract the spatial relationships between physical and virtual nodes. Second, we propose Virtual-Component Contrastive Learning, which aims to enrich the node representation by establishing the association between the patterns of virtual nodes and the regional patterns within graph components. Lastly, we design a Similarity-Based Graph Denoising Strategy, which reduces the connectivity strength of noisy connections around virtual nodes and their neighbors based on their temporal information and regional spatial patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DarkFarseer significantly outperforms existing ISK methods.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI'26 |
| **[SVD-NO: Learning PDE Solution Operators with SVD Integral Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10025v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural operators have emerged as a promising paradigm for learning solution operators of partial differential equa- tions (PDEs) directly from data. Existing methods, such as those based on Fourier or graph techniques, make strong as- sumptions about the structure of the kernel integral opera- tor, assumptions which may limit expressivity. We present SVD-NO, a neural operator that explicitly parameterizes the kernel by its singular-value decomposition (SVD) and then carries out the integral directly in the low-rank basis. Two lightweight networks learn the left and right singular func- tions, a diagonal parameter matrix learns the singular values, and a Gram-matrix regularizer enforces orthonormality. As SVD-NO approximates the full kernel, it obtains a high de- gree of expressivity. Furthermore, due to its low-rank struc- ture the computational complexity of applying the operator remains reasonable, leading to a practical system. In exten- sive evaluations on five diverse benchmark equations, SVD- NO achieves a new state of the art. In particular, SVD-NO provides greater performance gains on PDEs whose solutions are highly spatially variable.

| **[GraphSB: Boosting Imbalanced Node Classification on Graphs through Structural Balance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10022v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imbalanced node classification is a critical challenge in graph learning, where most existing methods typically utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn node representations. These methods can be broadly categorized into the data-level and the algorithm-level. The former aims to synthesize minority-class nodes to mitigate quantity imbalance, while the latter tries to optimize the learning process to highlight minority classes. However, neither category addresses the inherently imbalanced graph structure, which is a fundamental factor that incurs majority-class dominance and minority-class assimilation in GNNs. Our theoretical analysis further supports this critical insight. Therefore, we propose GraphSB (Graph Structural Balance), a novel framework that incorporates Structural Balance as a key strategy to address the underlying imbalanced graph structure before node synthesis. Structural Balance performs a two-stage structure optimization: Structure Enhancement that adaptively builds similarity-based edges to strengthen connectivity of minority-class nodes, and Relation Diffusion that captures higher-order dependencies while amplifying signals from minority classes. Thus, GraphSB balances structural distribution before node synthesis, enabling more effective learning in GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphSB significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, the proposed Structural Balance can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art methods as a simple plug-and-play module, increasing their accuracy by an average of 3.67\%.</p></details> |  |

However, predicting the diffusion trajectory and market impact of such content remains challenging due to data heterogeneity, non linear propagation mechanisms, and evolving consumer interactions. This study proposes an AI driven Decision Support System (DSS) that integrates multi source data including social media streams, marketing expenditure records, consumer engagement logs, and sentiment dynamics using a hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Temporal Transformer framework. The model jointly learns the content diffusion structure and temporal influence evolution through a dual channel architecture, while causal inference modules disentangle the effects of marketing stimuli on return on investment (ROI) and market visibility. Experiments on large scale real-world datasets collected from multiple online platforms such as Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube advertising show that our system outperforms existing baselines in all six metrics. The proposed DSS enhances marketing decisions by providing interpretable real-time insights into AIGC driven content dissemination and market growth patterns.</p></details> |  |

While powerful, ViGs often face substantial computational challenges stemming from their graph construction phase, which can hinder their efficiency. To address this issue we propose AdaptViG, an efficient and powerful hybrid Vision GNN that introduces a novel graph construction mechanism called Adaptive Graph Convolution. This mechanism builds upon a highly efficient static axial scaffold and a dynamic, content-aware gating strategy called Exponential Decay Gating. This gating mechanism selectively weighs long-range connections based on feature similarity. Furthermore, AdaptViG employs a hybrid strategy, utilizing our efficient gating mechanism in the early stages and a full Global Attention block in the final stage for maximum feature aggregation. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and efficiency among Vision GNNs. For instance, our AdaptViG-M achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy, outperforming ViG-B by 0.3% while using 80% fewer parameters and 84% fewer GMACs. On downstream tasks, AdaptViG-M obtains 45.8 mIoU, 44.8 APbox, and 41.1 APmask, surpassing the much larger EfficientFormer-L7 by 0.7 mIoU, 2.2 APbox, and 2.1 APmask, respectively, with 78% fewer parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 2026 IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV 2026)</p></details> |

As models increase in size and complexity, DNN workloads such as training and inference tasks impose unprecedented demands on distributed computing resources, making accurate runtime prediction essential for optimizing development and resource allocation. Traditional methods rely on additive computational unit models, limiting their accuracy and generalizability. In contrast, graph-enhanced modeling improves performance but significantly increases data collection costs. Therefore, there is a critical need for a method that strikes a balance between accuracy, generalizability, and data collection costs. To address these challenges, we propose ScaleDL, a novel runtime prediction framework that combines nonlinear layer-wise modeling with graph neural network (GNN)-based cross-layer interaction mechanism, enabling accurate DNN runtime prediction and hierarchical generalizability across different network architectures. Additionally, we employ the D-optimal method to reduce data collection costs. Experiments on the workloads of five popular DNN models demonstrate that ScaleDL enhances runtime prediction accuracy and generalizability, achieving 6 times lower MRE and 5 times lower RMSE compared to baseline models.</p></details> |  |

Differentiable causal graphical models have been proposed to infer a gene regulatory network (GRN) from large scale interventional datasets, capturing the causal gene regulatory relationships from genetic perturbations. However, existing models are limited in their expressivity and scalability while failing to address the dynamic nature of biological processes such as cellular differentiation. We propose PerturbODE, a novel framework that incorporates biologically informative neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) to model cell state trajectories under perturbations and derive the causal GRN from the neural ODE's parameters. We demonstrate PerturbODE's efficacy in trajectory prediction and GRN inference across simulated and real over-expression datasets.</p></details> |  |

These approaches iteratively measure low-order noisy marginals and fit graphical models to produce synthetic data, enabling systematic optimisation of data quality under privacy constraints. Graphical models, however, are inefficient for high-dimensional data because they require substantial memory and must be retrained from scratch whenever the graph structure changes, leading to significant computational overhead. Recent methods, like GEM, overcome these limitations by using generator neural networks for improved scalability. However, empirical comparisons have mostly focused on small datasets, limiting real-world applicability. In this work, we introduce GEM+, which integrates AIM's adaptive measurement framework with GEM's scalable generator network. Our experiments show that GEM+ outperforms AIM in both utility and scalability, delivering state-of-the-art results while efficiently handling datasets with over a hundred columns, where AIM fails due to memory and computational overheads.</p></details> |  |

However, 3D medical image classification remains a challenging task due to the complex spatial relationships and long-range dependencies inherent in volumetric data. Training models from scratch suffers from low data regimes, and the absence of 3D large-scale multimodal datasets has limited the development of 3D medical imaging foundation models. Recent studies, however, have highlighted the potential of 2D vision foundation models, originally trained on natural images, as powerful feature extractors for medical image analysis. Despite these advances, existing approaches that apply 2D models to 3D volumes via slice-based decomposition remain suboptimal. Conventional volume slicing strategies, which rely on canonical planes such as axial, sagittal, or coronal, may inadequately capture the spatial extent of target structures when these are misaligned with standardized viewing planes. Furthermore, existing slice-wise aggregation strategies rarely account for preserving the volumetric structure, resulting in a loss of spatial coherence across slices. To overcome these limitations, we propose TomoGraphView, a novel framework that integrates omnidirectional volume slicing with spherical graph-based feature aggregation. We publicly share our accessible code base at http://github.com/compai-lab/2025-MedIA-kiechle and provide a user-friendly library for omnidirectional volume slicing at https://pypi.org/project/OmniSlicer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to Medical Image Analysis (MedIA)</p></details> |

To address this limitation, we propose GNNMoE, a novel entropy-driven mixture of message-passing experts framework that enables node-level adaptive representation learning. GNNMoE decomposes message passing into propagation and transformation operations and integrates them through multiple expert networks guided by a hybrid routing mechanism. And a routing entropy regularization dynamically adjusts soft weighting and soft top-$k$ routing, allowing GNNMoE to flexibly adapt to diverse neighborhood contexts.

| **[DynamicRTL: RTL Representation Learning for Dynamic Circuit Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09593v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a growing body of work on using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn representations of circuits, focusing primarily on their static characteristics. However, these models fail to capture circuit runtime behavior, which is crucial for tasks like circuit verification and optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce DR-GNN (DynamicRTL-GNN), a novel approach that learns RTL circuit representations by incorporating both static structures and multi-cycle execution behaviors. DR-GNN leverages an operator-level Control Data Flow Graph (CDFG) to represent Register Transfer Level (RTL) circuits, enabling the model to capture dynamic dependencies and runtime execution. To train and evaluate DR-GNN, we build the first comprehensive dynamic circuit dataset, comprising over 6,300 Verilog designs and 63,000 simulation traces. Our results demonstrate that DR-GNN outperforms existing models in branch hit prediction and toggle rate prediction. Furthermore, its learned representations transfer effectively to related dynamic circuit tasks, achieving strong performance in power estimation and assertion prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI'2026</p></details> |
| **[Conditional Distribution Learning for Graph Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15206v3)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging the diversity and quantity of data provided by various graph-structured data augmentations while preserving intrinsic semantic information is challenging. Additionally, successive layers in graph neural network (GNN) tend to produce more similar node embeddings, while graph contrastive learning aims to increase the dissimilarity between negative pairs of node embeddings. This inevitably results in a conflict between the message-passing mechanism (MPM) of GNNs and the contrastive learning (CL) of negative pairs via intraviews. In this paper, we propose a conditional distribution learning (CDL) method that learns graph representations from graph-structured data for semisupervised graph classification. Specifically, we present an end-to-end graph representation learning model to align the conditional distributions of weakly and strongly augmented features over the original features. This alignment enables the CDL model to effectively preserve intrinsic semantic information when both weak and strong augmentations are applied to graph-structured data. To avoid the conflict between the MPM and the CL of negative pairs, positive pairs of node representations are retained for measuring the similarity between the original features and the corresponding weakly augmented features. Extensive experiments with several benchmark graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CDL method.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Graph Contrastive Learning for Connectome Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05109v2)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With recent advancements in non-invasive techniques for measuring brain activity, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the study of structural and functional brain networks through graph signal processing (GSP) has gained notable prominence. GSP stands as a key tool in unraveling the interplay between the brain's function and structure, enabling the analysis of graphs defined by the connections between regions of interest -- referred to as connectomes in this context. Our work represents a further step in this direction by exploring supervised contrastive learning methods within the realm of graph representation learning. The main objective of this approach is to generate subject-level (i.e., graph-level) vector representations that bring together subjects sharing the same label while separating those with different labels. These connectome embeddings are derived from a graph neural network Encoder-Decoder architecture, which jointly considers structural and functional connectivity. By leveraging data augmentation techniques, the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in a gender classification task using Human Connectome Project data. More broadly, our connectome-centric methodological advances support the promising prospect of using GSP to discover more about brain function, with potential impact to understanding heterogeneity in the neurodegeneration for precision medicine and diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Distributed Training Architecture For Combinatorial Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09261v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in tackling combinatorial optimization problems. However, existing methods still suffer from limited accuracy when addressing that on complex graphs and exhibit poor scalability, since full training requires loading the whole adjacent matrix and all embeddings at a time, the it may results in out of memory of a single machine. This limitation significantly restricts their applicability to large-scale scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed GNN-based training framework for combinatorial optimization. In details, firstly, large graph is partition into several small subgraphs. Then the individual subgraphs are full trained, providing a foundation for efficient local optimization. Finally, reinforcement learning (RL) are employed to take actions according to GNN output, to make sure the restrictions between cross nodes can be learned. Extensive experiments are conducted on both real large-scale social network datasets (e.g., Facebook, Youtube) and synthetically generated high-complexity graphs, which demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both solution quality and computational efficiency. Moreover, the experiments on large graph instances also validate the scalability of the model.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoCo-MILP: Inter-Variable Contrastive and Intra-Constraint Competitive MILP Solution Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09209v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a cornerstone of combinatorial optimization, yet solving large-scale instances remains a significant computational challenge. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in accelerating MILP solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, we identify that existing methods misalign with the intrinsic structure of MILP problems at two levels. At the leaning objective level, the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss treats variables independently, neglecting their relative priority and yielding plausible logits. At the model architecture level, standard GNN message passing inherently smooths the representations across variables, missing the natural competitive relationships within constraints. To address these challenges, we propose CoCo-MILP, which explicitly models inter-variable Contrast and intra-constraint Competition for advanced MILP solution prediction. At the objective level, CoCo-MILP introduces the Inter-Variable Contrastive Loss (VCL), which explicitly maximizes the embedding margin between variables assigned one versus zero. At the architectural level, we design an Intra-Constraint Competitive GNN layer that, instead of homogenizing features, learns to differentiate representations of competing variables within a constraint, capturing their exclusionary nature. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoCo-MILP significantly outperforms existing learning-based approaches, reducing the solution gap by up to 68.12% compared to traditional solvers.

To address this limitation, this work introduces an open-source platform that exploits Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) to accelerate SEU fault simulation. The platform includes three STGNN architectures incorporating advanced components such as Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) and attention mechanisms, thereby improving spatio-temporal feature extraction. In addition, SEU fault simulation datasets are constructed from six open-source circuits with varying levels of complexity, providing a comprehensive benchmark for performance evaluation. The predictive capability of the STGNN models is analyzed and compared on these datasets. Moreover, to further investigate the efficiency of the approach, we evaluate the predictive capability of STGNNs across multiple test cases and discuss their generalization capability. The developed platform and datasets are released as open-source to support reproducibility and further research on https://github.com/luli2021/FsimNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Generalisable Cyber Defence Agent for Real-World Computer Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09114v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning for autonomous cyber defence have resulted in agents that can successfully defend simulated computer networks against cyber-attacks. However, many of these agents would need retraining to defend networks with differing topology or size, making them poorly suited to real-world networks where topology and size can vary over time. In this research we introduce a novel set of Topological Extensions for Reinforcement Learning Agents (TERLA) that provide generalisability for the defence of networks with differing topology and size, without the need for retraining. Our approach involves the use of heterogeneous graph neural network layers to produce a fixed-size latent embedding representing the observed network state. This representation learning stage is coupled with a reduced, fixed-size, semantically meaningful and interpretable action space. We apply TERLA to a standard deep reinforcement learning Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) agent model, and to reduce the sim-to-real gap, conduct our research using Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 4. This Cyber Operations Research Gym environment has many of the features of a real-world network, such as realistic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) events and multiple agents defending network segments of differing topology and size. TERLA agents retain the defensive performance of vanilla PPO agents whilst showing improved action efficiency. Generalisability has been demonstrated by showing that all TERLA agents have the same network-agnostic neural network architecture, and by deploying a single TERLA agent multiple times to defend network segments with differing topology and size, showing improved defensive performance and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>CAMLI...</summary><p>CAMLIS 2025.

| **[Mixture of Scope Experts at Test: Generalizing Deeper Graph Neural Networks with Shallow Variants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06998v4)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterophilous graphs, where dissimilar nodes tend to connect, pose a challenge for graph neural networks (GNNs). Increasing the GNN depth can expand the scope (i.e., receptive field), potentially finding homophily from the higher-order neighborhoods. However, GNNs suffer from performance degradation as depth increases. Despite having better expressivity, state-of-the-art deeper GNNs achieve only marginal improvements compared to their shallow variants. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we systematically demonstrate a shift in GNN generalization preferences across nodes with different homophily levels as depth increases. This creates a disparity in generalization patterns between GNN models with varying depth. Based on these findings, we propose to improve deeper GNN generalization while maintaining high expressivity by Mixture of scope experts at test (Moscat). Experimental results show that Moscat works flexibly with various GNNs across a wide range of datasets while significantly improving accuracy. Our code is available at (https://github.com/Hydrapse/moscat).</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[GeoGNN: Quantifying and Mitigating Semantic Drift in Text-Attributed Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09042v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) on text--attributed graphs (TAGs) typically encode node texts using pretrained language models (PLMs) and propagate these embeddings through linear neighborhood aggregation. However, the representation spaces of modern PLMs are highly non--linear and geometrically structured, where textual embeddings reside on curved semantic manifolds rather than flat Euclidean spaces. Linear aggregation on such manifolds inevitably distorts geometry and causes semantic drift--a phenomenon where aggregated representations deviate from the intrinsic manifold, losing semantic fidelity and expressive power. To quantitatively investigate this problem, this work introduces a local PCA--based metric that measures the degree of semantic drift and provides the first quantitative framework to analyze how different aggregation mechanisms affect manifold structure. Building upon these insights, we propose Geodesic Aggregation, a manifold--aware mechanism that aggregates neighbor information along geodesics via log--exp mappings on the unit sphere, ensuring that representations remain faithful to the semantic manifold during message passing. We further develop GeoGNN, a practical instantiation that integrates spherical attention with manifold interpolation. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple text encoders show that GeoGNN substantially mitigates semantic drift and consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing the importance of manifold--aware aggregation in text--attributed graph learning.</p></details> | 10 pages |

We present the first Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to approximate credulous acceptance in ABA. To leverage GNNs, we model ABA frameworks via a dependency graph representation encoding assumptions, claims and rules as nodes, with heterogeneous edge labels distinguishing support, derive and attack relations. We propose two GNN architectures - ABAGCN and ABAGAT - that stack residual heterogeneous convolution or attention layers, respectively, to learn node embeddings. Our models are trained on the ICCMA 2023 benchmark, augmented with synthetic ABAFs, with hyperparameters optimised via Bayesian search. Empirically, both ABAGCN and ABAGAT outperform a state-of-the-art GNN baseline that we adapt from the abstract argumentation literature, achieving a node-level F1 score of up to 0.71 on the ICCMA instances. Finally, we develop a sound polynomial time extension-reconstruction algorithm driven by our predictor: it reconstructs stable extensions with F1 above 0.85 on small ABAFs and maintains an F1 of about 0.58 on large frameworks. Our work opens new avenues for scalable approximate reasoning in structured argumentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI2026.

These limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction performance and lightweight deployment.Our code is available at https://github.com/jinguangyin/M3_NET</p></details> |  |

The core idea is to decompose state-of-the-art Graph Neural Networks, LLMs, and Table Neural Networks into standardized modules, to enable the fast construction of novel RTL-type models in a simple "combine, align, and co-train" manner. To illustrate the usage of rLLM, we introduce a simple RTL method named \textbf{BRIDGE}. Additionally, we present three novel relational tabular datasets (TML1M, TLF2K, and TACM12K) by enhancing classic datasets. We hope rLLM can serve as a useful and easy-to-use development framework for RTL-related tasks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/rllm-project/rllm.</p></details> |  |

However, their high computational cost can limit its practicality. Alternative techniques, such as Monte Carlo dropout and deep kernel learning, have been proposed to improve computational efficiency; however, some of these methods cannot be applied to already trained models and may affect the prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient post-hoc framework for UQ that leverages the descriptor of a trained graph neural network potential to estimate residual errors. We refer to this method as post-hoc descriptor-based residual uncertainty modeling (P-DRUM). P-DRUM models the discrepancy between MLIP predictions and ground truth values, allowing these residuals to act as proxies for prediction uncertainty. We explore multiple variants of P-DRUM and benchmark them against established UQ methods, evaluating both their effectiveness and limitations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences (ML4PS)</p></details> |
| **[Covariance Scattering Transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08878v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning and data processing techniques relying on covariance information are widespread as they identify meaningful patterns in unsupervised and unlabeled settings. As a prominent example, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) projects data points onto the eigenvectors of their covariance matrix, capturing the directions of maximum variance. This mapping, however, falls short in two directions: it fails to capture information in low-variance directions, relevant when, e.g., the data contains high-variance noise; and it provides unstable results in low-sample regimes, especially when covariance eigenvalues are close. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs), i.e., graph neural networks using the covariance matrix as a graph, show improved stability to estimation errors and learn more expressive functions in the covariance spectrum than PCA, but require training and operate in a labeled setup. To get the benefits of both worlds, we propose Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs), deep untrained networks that sequentially apply filters localized in the covariance spectrum to the input data and produce expressive hierarchical representations via nonlinearities. We define the filters as covariance wavelets that capture specific and detailed covariance spectral patterns. We improve CSTs' computational and memory efficiency via a pruning mechanism, and we prove that their error due to finite-sample covariance estimations is less sensitive to close covariance eigenvalues compared to PCA, improving their stability. Our experiments on age prediction from cortical thickness measurements on 4 datasets collecting patients with neurodegenerative diseases show that CSTs produce stable representations in low-data settings, as VNNs but without any training, and lead to comparable or better predictions w.r.t. more complex learning models.</p></details> |  |

Traditional defense strategies typically operate within this fragile pixel domain, lacking mechanisms to incorporate inherently robust visual features. In this work, we introduce SIFT-Graph, a multimodal defense framework that enhances the robustness of traditional vision models by aggregating structurally meaningful features extracted from raw images using both handcrafted and learned modalities. Specifically, we integrate Scale-Invariant Feature Transform keypoints with a Graph Attention Network to capture scale and rotation invariant local structures that are resilient to perturbations. These robust feature embeddings are then fused with traditional vision model, such as Vision Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network, to form a unified, structure-aware and perturbation defensive model. Preliminary results demonstrate that our method effectively improves the visual model robustness against gradient-based white box adversarial attacks, while incurring only a marginal drop in clean accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV2025 Workshop, short paper</p></details> |

While traditional numerical solvers are powerful, they are often computationally expensive. Recently, data-driven methods have emerged as alternatives, but they frequently suffer from error accumulation and limited physical consistency, especially in multiphysics and complex geometries. To address these challenges, we propose PEGNet, a Physics-Embedded Graph Network that incorporates PDE-guided message passing to redesign the graph neural network architecture. By embedding key PDE dynamics like convection, viscosity, and diffusion into distinct message functions, the model naturally integrates physical constraints into its forward propagation, producing more stable and physically consistent solutions. Additionally, a hierarchical architecture is employed to capture multi-scale features, and physical regularization is integrated into the loss function to further enforce adherence to governing physics. We evaluated PEGNet on benchmarks, including custom datasets for respiratory airflow and drug delivery, showing significant improvements in long-term prediction accuracy and physical consistency over existing methods.

While logic inference on top of subsymbolic modules has been shown to effectively guarantee these properties, this often comes at the cost of reduced scalability, which can severely limit the usability of NeSy models. This paper introduces DeepProofLog (DPrL), a novel NeSy system based on stochastic logic programs, which addresses the scalability limitations of previous methods. DPrL parameterizes all derivation steps with neural networks, allowing efficient neural guidance over the proving system. Additionally, we establish a formal mapping between the resolution process of our deep stochastic logic programs and Markov Decision Processes, enabling the application of dynamic programming and reinforcement learning techniques for efficient inference and learning. This theoretical connection improves scalability for complex proof spaces and large knowledge bases. Our experiments on standard NeSy benchmarks and knowledge graph reasoning tasks demonstrate that DPrL outperforms existing state-of-the-art NeSy systems, advancing scalability to larger and more complex settings than previously possible.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

We propose Adaptive Regularized Multi-Agent Soft Actor-Critic (ARAC), which integrates an attention-based graph neural network (GNN) for modeling agent dependencies with an adaptive divergence regularization mechanism. The GNN enables expressive representation of spatial relations and state features in graph environments. Divergence regularization can serve as policy guidance to alleviate the sparse reward problem, but it may lead to suboptimal convergence when the reference policy itself is imperfect. The adaptive divergence regularization mechanism enables the framework to exploit reference policies for efficient exploration in the early stages, while gradually reducing reliance on them as training progresses to avoid inheriting their limitations. Experiments in pursuit and confrontation scenarios demonstrate that ARAC achieves faster convergence, higher final success rates, and stronger scalability across varying numbers of agents compared with MARL baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in complex graph-structured environments.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, these methods often fail to capture the complex argumentative reasoning and negotiation dynamics inherent in reviewer-author interactions. To address these limitations, we propose ReViewGraph (Reviewer-Author Debates Graph Reasoner), a novel framework that performs heterogeneous graph reasoning over LLM-simulated multi-round reviewer-author debates. In our approach, reviewer-author exchanges are simulated through LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. Diverse opinion relations (e.g., acceptance, rejection, clarification, and compromise) are then explicitly extracted and encoded as typed edges within a heterogeneous interaction graph. By applying graph neural networks to reason over these structured debate graphs, ReViewGraph captures fine-grained argumentative dynamics and enables more informed review decisions. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that ReViewGraph outperforms strong baselines with an average relative improvement of 15.73%, underscoring the value of modeling detailed reviewer-author debate structures.</p></details> |  |

In BDD-based reversible-circuit synthesis, which is critical for quantum computing, the chosen variable ordering governs the number of BDD nodes and thus the key metrics of resource consumption, such as Quantum Cost. Because finding an optimal variable ordering for BDDs is an NP-complete problem, existing heuristics often degrade as circuit complexity grows. We introduce BDD2Seq, a graph-to-sequence framework that couples a Graph Neural Network encoder with a Pointer-Network decoder and Diverse Beam Search to predict high-quality orderings. By treating the circuit netlist as a graph, BDD2Seq learns structural dependencies that conventional heuristics overlooked, yielding smaller BDDs and faster synthesis. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks show that BDD2Seq achieves around 1.4 times lower Quantum Cost and 3.7 times faster synthesis than modern heuristic algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to tackle the variable-ordering problem in BDD-based reversible-circuit synthesis with a graph-based generative model and diversity-promoting decoding.</p></details> |  |

However, its scalability on large-scale graphs is hindered by the intensive message passing mechanism of GNN and the quadratic computational complexity of contrastive loss over positive and negative node pairs. To address these issues, we propose an efficient GCL framework that transforms the input graph into a compact network of interconnected node sets while preserving structural information across communities. We firstly introduce a kernelized graph community contrastive loss with linear complexity, enabling effective information transfer among node sets to capture hierarchical structural information of the graph. We then incorporate a knowledge distillation technique into the decoupled GNN architecture to accelerate inference while maintaining strong generalization performance. Extensive experiments on sixteen real-world datasets of varying scales demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art GCL baselines in both effectiveness and scalability.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce the Complex-Valued Stuart-Landau Graph Neural Network (SLGNN), a novel architecture grounded in Stuart-Landau oscillator dynamics. Stuart-Landau oscillators are canonical models of limit-cycle behavior near Hopf bifurcations, which are fundamental to synchronization theory and are widely used in e.g. neuroscience for mesoscopic brain modeling. Unlike harmonic oscillators and phase-only Kuramoto models, Stuart-Landau oscillators retain both amplitude and phase dynamics, enabling rich phenomena such as amplitude regulation and multistable synchronization. The proposed SLGNN generalizes existing phase-centric Kuramoto-based OGNNs by allowing node feature amplitudes to evolve dynamically according to Stuart-Landau dynamics, with explicit tunable hyperparameters (such as the Hopf-parameter and the coupling strength) providing additional control over the interplay between feature amplitudes and network structure. We conduct extensive experiments across node classification, graph classification, and graph regression tasks, demonstrating that SLGNN outperforms existing OGNNs and establishes a novel, expressive, and theoretically grounded framework for deep oscillatory architectures on graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combining LLM Semantic Reasoning with GNN Structural Modeling for Multi-view Multi-Label Feature Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08008v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-view multi-label feature selection aims to identify informative features from heterogeneous views, where each sample is associated with multiple interdependent labels. This problem is particularly important in machine learning involving high-dimensional, multimodal data such as social media, bioinformatics or recommendation systems. Existing Multi-View Multi-Label Feature Selection (MVMLFS) methods mainly focus on analyzing statistical information of data, but seldom consider semantic information. In this paper, we aim to use these two types of information jointly and propose a method that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) semantic reasoning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) structural modeling for MVMLFS. Specifically, the method consists of three main components. (1) LLM is first used as an evaluation agent to assess the latent semantic relevance among feature, view, and label descriptions. (2) A semantic-aware heterogeneous graph with two levels is designed to represent relations among features, views and labels: one is a semantic graph representing semantic relations, and the other is a statistical graph. (3) A lightweight Graph Attention Network (GAT) is applied to learn node embedding in the heterogeneous graph as feature saliency scores for ranking and selection. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines, and it is still effective when applied to small-scale datasets, showcasing its robustness, flexibility, and generalization ability.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing approaches rely on simplistic state representations and fuse heterogeneous information via naive concatenation, limiting their ability to capture rich structural and semantic context. To address these limitations, we propose GAMA, a neural neighborhood search method with Graph-aware Multi-modal Attention model in VRP. GAMA encodes the problem instance and its evolving solution as distinct modalities using graph neural networks, and models their intra- and inter-modal interactions through stacked self- and cross-attention layers. A gated fusion mechanism further integrates the multi-modal representations into a structured state, enabling the policy to make informed and generalizable operator selection decisions. Extensive experiments conducted across various synthetic and benchmark instances demonstrate that the proposed algorithm GAMA significantly outperforms the recent neural baselines. Further ablation studies confirm that both the multi-modal attention mechanism and the gated fusion design play a key role in achieving the observed performance gains.</p></details> |  |

However, current graph neural networks (GNNs) produce suboptimal results for subgraph-level tasks due to their inability to capture complex interactions within and between subgraphs. To provide a more expressive and efficient alternative, we propose WLKS, a Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) kernel generalized for subgraphs by applying the WL algorithm on induced $k$-hop neighborhoods. We combine kernels across different $k$-hop levels to capture richer structural information that is not fully encoded in existing models. Our approach can balance expressiveness and efficiency by eliminating the need for neighborhood sampling. In experiments on eight real-world and synthetic benchmarks, WLKS significantly outperforms leading approaches on five datasets while reducing training time, ranging from 0.01x to 0.25x compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Camera Ready (15 pages), with minor typos fixed</p></details> |
| **[Dual Mamba for Node-Specific Representation Learning: Tackling Over-Smoothing with Selective State Space Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06756v2)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over-smoothing remains a fundamental challenge in deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where repeated message passing causes node representations to become indistinguishable. While existing solutions, such as residual connections and skip layers, alleviate this issue to some extent, they fail to explicitly model how node representations evolve in a node-specific and progressive manner across layers. Moreover, these methods do not take global information into account, which is also crucial for mitigating the over-smoothing problem. To address the aforementioned issues, in this work, we propose a Dual Mamba-enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (DMbaGCN), which is a novel framework that integrates Mamba into GNNs to address over-smoothing from both local and global perspectives. DMbaGCN consists of two modules: the Local State-Evolution Mamba (LSEMba) for local neighborhood aggregation and utilizing Mamba's selective state space modeling to capture node-specific representation dynamics across layers, and the Global Context-Aware Mamba (GCAMba) that leverages Mamba's global attention capabilities to incorporate global context for each node. By combining these components, DMbaGCN enhances node discriminability in deep GNNs, thereby mitigating over-smoothing. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Traditional SPICE simulations are time-consuming, while existing machine learning methods often require topology-specific retraining or manual substructure segmentation for fine-tuning, hindering scalability and adaptability. In this work, we propose ZeroSim, a transformer-based performance modeling framework designed to achieve robust in-distribution generalization across trained topologies under novel parameter configurations and zero-shot generalization to unseen topologies without any fine-tuning. We apply three key enabling strategies: (1) a diverse training corpus of 3.6 million instances covering over 60 amplifier topologies, (2) unified topology embeddings leveraging global-aware tokens and hierarchical attention to robustly generalize to novel circuits, and (3) a topology-conditioned parameter mapping approach that maintains consistent structural representations independent of parameter variations. Our experimental results demonstrate that ZeroSim significantly outperforms baseline models such as multilayer perceptrons, graph neural networks and transformers, delivering accurate zero-shot predictions across different amplifier topologies. Additionally, when integrated into a reinforcement learning-based parameter optimization pipeline, ZeroSim achieves a remarkable speedup (13x) compared to conventional SPICE simulations, underscoring its practical value for a wide range of analog circuit design automation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCAD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Safeguarding Graph Neural Networks against Topology Inference Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05429v3)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for learning from graph-structured data. However, their widespread adoption has raised serious privacy concerns. While prior research has primarily focused on edge-level privacy, a critical yet underexplored threat lies in topology privacy - the confidentiality of the graph's overall structure. In this work, we present a comprehensive study on topology privacy risks in GNNs, revealing their vulnerability to graph-level inference attacks. To this end, we propose a suite of Topology Inference Attacks (TIAs) that can reconstruct the structure of a target training graph using only black-box access to a GNN model. Our findings show that GNNs are highly susceptible to these attacks, and that existing edge-level differential privacy mechanisms are insufficient as they either fail to mitigate the risk or severely compromise model accuracy. To address this challenge, we introduce Private Graph Reconstruction (PGR), a novel defense framework designed to protect topology privacy while maintaining model accuracy. PGR is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, where a synthetic training graph is iteratively generated using meta-gradients, and the GNN model is concurrently updated based on the evolving graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PGR significantly reduces topology leakage with minimal impact on model accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/JeffffffFu/PGR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accte...</summary><p>Acctepted by ACM CCS'25</p></details> |

In particular, these simulators enable end-to-end training of machine learning (ML) models embedded within CFD solvers. This paradigm enables novel algorithms which combine the generalization power and low cost of physics-based simulations with the flexibility and automation of deep learning methods. In this study, we introduce a framework for embedding deep learning models within a finite element solver for incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, specifically applying this approach to learn a subgrid-scale (SGS) closure with a graph neural network (GNN). We first demonstrate the feasibility of the approach on flow over a two-dimensional backward-facing step, using it as a proof of concept to show that solver-consistent training produces stable and physically meaningful closures. Then, we extend this to a turbulent flow over a three-dimensional backward-facing step. In this setting, the GNN-based closure not only attains low prediction errors, but also recovers key turbulence statistics and preserves multiscale turbulent structures. We further demonstrate that the closure can be identified in data-limited learning scenarios as well. Overall, the proposed end-to-end learning paradigm offers a viable pathway toward physically consistent and generalizable data-driven SGS modeling on complex and unstructured domains.</p></details> |  |

However, this can cause overreliance on surface-level labels and impede cross-type knowledge transfer. We explore integrating Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) into HGNNs--a direction underexplored despite MoE's success in homogeneous settings. Crucially, we question the need for type-specific experts. We propose Homogeneous Expert Routing (HER), an MoE layer for Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGT) that stochastically masks type embeddings during routing to encourage type-agnostic specialization. Evaluated on IMDB, ACM, and DBLP for link prediction, HER consistently outperforms standard HGT and a type-separated MoE baseline. Analysis on IMDB shows HER experts specialize by semantic patterns (e.g., movie genres) rather than node types, confirming routing is driven by latent semantics. Our work demonstrates that regularizing type dependence in expert routing yields more generalizable, efficient, and interpretable representations--a new design principle for heterogeneous graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures; 2 tables; work in progress, feedback welcome</p></details> |

However, their susceptibility to poisoning attacks poses a critical security risk. We introduce LoReTTA (Low Resource Two-phase Temporal Attack), a novel adversarial framework on Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs, which degrades TGNN performance by an average of 29.47% across 4 widely benchmark datasets and 4 State-of-the-Art (SotA) models. LoReTTA operates through a two-stage approach: (1) sparsify the graph by removing high-impact edges using any of the 16 tested temporal importance metrics, (2) strategically replace removed edges with adversarial negatives via LoReTTA's novel degree-preserving negative sampling algorithm. Our plug-and-play design eliminates the need for expensive surrogate models while adhering to realistic unnoticeability constraints. LoReTTA degrades performance by upto 42.0% on MOOC, 31.5% on Wikipedia, 28.8% on UCI, and 15.6% on Enron. LoReTTA outperforms 11 attack baselines, remains undetectable to 4 leading anomaly detection systems, and is robust to 4 SotA adversarial defense training methods, establishing its effectiveness, unnoticeability, and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

While single-table tabular data generation has seen considerable progress, current methods for multi-table data often lack the flexibility and expressiveness needed to capture complex relational structures. In particular, they struggle with long-range dependencies and complex foreign-key relationships, such as tables with multiple parent tables or multiple types of links between the same pair of tables. We propose a generative model for relational data that generates the content of a relational dataset given the graph formed by the foreign-key relationships. We do this by learning a deep generative model of the content of the whole relational database by flow matching, where the neural network trained to denoise records leverages a graph neural network to obtain information from connected records. Our method is flexible, as it can support relational datasets with complex structures, and expressive, as the generation of each record can be influenced by any other record within the same connected component. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of synthetic data fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages of main content, accepted to AAAI26 conference</p></details> |

However, existing RSSI-based positioning methods often suffer from reduced accuracy due to environmental complexity and challenges in processing multi-source information. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-graph heterogeneous GNN framework (MG-HGNN) to enhance spatial awareness and improve positioning performance. In this framework, two graph construction branches perform node and edge embedding, respectively, to generate informative graphs. Subsequently, a heterogeneous graph neural network is employed for graph representation learning, enabling accurate positioning. The MG-HGNN framework introduces the following key innovations: 1) multi-type task-directed graph construction that combines label estimation and feature encoding for richer graph information; 2) a heterogeneous GNN structure that enhances the performance of conventional GNN models. Evaluations on the UJIIndoorLoc and UTSIndoorLoc public datasets demonstrate that MG-HGNN not only achieves superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods, but also provides a novel perspective for enhancing GNN-based localization methods. Ablation studies further confirm the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 11 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

The approach leverages gradient-based saliency maps derived from trained neural networks to guide the discovery process. Multiclass time series classification problems are transformed into binary classification problems through label subsumption, and classifiers are trained for each of these to yield saliency maps. The input signals, grouped by predicted class, are clustered under three distinct configurations. The centroids of the final set of clusters are provided as input to an LLM for symbolic approximation and fuzzy knowledge graph matching to discover the underlying subclasses of the original multiclass problem. Experimental results on well-established time series classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our saliency map-driven method for knowledge discovery, outperforming signal-only baselines in both clustering and subclass identification.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional frameworks that focus on regressing scalar quantities and derive tensorial properties from their derivatives, our approach maintains $SO(3)$-equivariance through the use of local coordinate frames. Our GNN effectively captures geometric information by integrating scalar, vector, and tensor channels within a local message-passing framework. To assess the accuracy of our model, we apply it to predict the polarizabilities of molecules in the QM7-X dataset and show that tensorial message passing outperforms scalar message passing models. This work marks an advancement towards developing structured, geometry-aware neural models for molecular property prediction.</p></details> |  |

Attribution graphs reveal these feature pathways, but interpreting them requires extensive manual analysis -- a single prompt can take approximately 2 hours for an experienced circuit tracer. We present probe prompting, an automated pipeline that transforms attribution graphs into compact, interpretable subgraphs built from concept-aligned supernodes. Starting from a seed prompt and target logit, we select high-influence features, generate concept-targeted yet context-varying probes, and group features by cross-prompt activation signatures into Semantic, Relationship, and Say-X categories using transparent decision rules. Across five prompts including classic "capitals" circuits, probe-prompted subgraphs preserve high explanatory coverage while compressing complexity (Completeness 0.83, mean across circuits; Replacement 0.54). Compared to geometric clustering baselines, concept-aligned groups exhibit higher behavioral coherence: 2.3x higher peak-token consistency (0.425 vs 0.183) and 5.8x higher activation-pattern similarity (0.762 vs 0.130), despite lower geometric compactness. Entity-swap tests reveal a layerwise hierarchy: early-layer features transfer robustly (64% transfer rate, mean layer 6.3), while late-layer Say-X features specialize for output promotion (mean layer 16.4), supporting a backbone-and-specialization view of transformer computation.

However, many leading Graph Neural Network (GNN) models often neglect the valuable semantic information aggregated at the class level. To address this limitation, this paper introduces CGLE (Class-label Graph Link Estimator), a novel framework designed to augment GNN-based link prediction models. CGLE operates by constructing a class-conditioned link probability matrix, where each entry represents the probability of a link forming between two node classes. This matrix is derived from either available ground-truth labels or from pseudo-labels obtained through clustering. The resulting class-based prior is then concatenated with the structural link embedding from a backbone GNN, and the combined representation is processed by a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for the final prediction. Crucially, CGLE's logic is encapsulated in an efficient preprocessing stage, leaving the computational complexity of the underlying GNN model unaffected. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on a broad suite of benchmark datasets, covering both homophilous and sparse heterophilous graphs. The results show that CGLE yields substantial performance gains over strong baselines such as NCN and NCNC, with improvements in HR@100 of over 10 percentage points on homophilous datasets like Pubmed and DBLP. On sparse heterophilous graphs, CGLE delivers an MRR improvement of over 4% on the Chameleon dataset. Our work underscores the efficacy of integrating global, data-driven semantic priors, presenting a compelling alternative to the pursuit of increasingly complex model architectures.

| **[S-DAG: A Subject-Based Directed Acyclic Graph for Multi-Agent Heterogeneous Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06727v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in complex reasoning problems. Their effectiveness highly depends on the specific nature of the task, especially the required domain knowledge. Existing approaches, such as mixture-of-experts, typically operate at the task level; they are too coarse to effectively solve the heterogeneous problems involving multiple subjects. This work proposes a novel framework that performs fine-grained analysis at subject level equipped with a designated multi-agent collaboration strategy for addressing heterogeneous problem reasoning. Specifically, given an input query, we first employ a Graph Neural Network to identify the relevant subjects and infer their interdependencies to generate an \textit{Subject-based Directed Acyclic Graph} (S-DAG), where nodes represent subjects and edges encode information flow. Then we profile the LLM models by assigning each model a subject-specific expertise score, and select the top-performing one for matching corresponding subject of the S-DAG. Such subject-model matching enables graph-structured multi-agent collaboration where information flows from the starting model to the ending model over S-DAG. We curate and release multi-subject subsets of standard benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, MedMCQA) to better reflect complex, real-world reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing task-level model selection and multi-agent collaboration baselines in accuracy and efficiency. These results highlight the effectiveness of subject-aware reasoning and structured collaboration in addressing complex and multi-subject problems.</p></details> |  |

Conventional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as Adapters and LoRA, typically break symmetry, making them incompatible with those equivariant architectures. ELoRA, recently proposed, is the first equivariant PEFT method. It achieves improved parameter efficiency and performance on many benchmarks. However, the relatively high degrees of freedom it retains within each tensor order can still perturb pretrained feature distributions and ultimately degrade performance. To address this, we present Magnitude-Modulated Equivariant Adapter (MMEA), a novel equivariant fine-tuning method which employs lightweight scalar gating to modulate feature magnitudes on a per-order and per-multiplicity basis. We demonstrate that MMEA preserves strict equivariance and, across multiple benchmarks, consistently improves energy and force predictions to state-of-the-art levels while training fewer parameters than competing approaches. These results suggest that, in many practical scenarios, modulating channel magnitudes is sufficient to adapt equivariant models to new chemical environments without breaking symmetry, pointing toward a new paradigm for equivariant PEFT design.</p></details> |  |

However, obtaining high-resolution CSI remains challenging in practical wireless communication systems. To address this issue, we propose to utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and score-based generative models to enable robust HBF under imperfect CSI conditions. Firstly, we develop the Hybrid Message Graph Attention Network (HMGAT) which updates both node and edge features through node-level and edge-level message passing. Secondly, we design a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based Noise Conditional Score Network (NCSN) to learn the distribution of high-resolution CSI, facilitating CSI generation and data augmentation to further improve HMGAT's performance. Finally, we present a Denoising Score Network (DSN) framework and its instantiation, termed DeBERT, which can denoise imperfect CSI under arbitrary channel error levels, thereby facilitating robust HBF. Experiments on DeepMIMO urban datasets demonstrate the proposed models' superior generalization, scalability, and robustness across various HBF tasks with perfect and imperfect CSI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Flow Matching: Enhancing Image Generation with Neighbor-Aware Flow Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24434v3)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching casts sample generation as learning a continuous-time velocity field that transports noise to data. Existing flow matching networks typically predict each point's velocity independently, considering only its location and time along its flow trajectory, and ignoring neighboring points. However, this pointwise approach may overlook correlations between points along the generation trajectory that could enhance velocity predictions, thereby improving downstream generation quality. To address this, we propose Graph Flow Matching (GFM), a lightweight enhancement that decomposes the learned velocity into a reaction term -- any standard flow matching network -- and a diffusion term that aggregates neighbor information via a graph neural module. This reaction-diffusion formulation retains the scalability of deep flow models while enriching velocity predictions with local context, all at minimal additional computational cost. Operating in the latent space of a pretrained variational autoencoder, GFM consistently improves Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and recall across five image generation benchmarks (LSUN Church, LSUN Bedroom, FFHQ, AFHQ-Cat, and CelebA-HQ at $256\times256$), demonstrating its effectiveness as a modular enhancement to existing flow matching architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 4...</summary><p>The 40th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

Recent advanced methods leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and contrastive learning to characterize the spatial structure of road segments in a self-supervised paradigm. However, spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics of road networks raise severe challenges to the neighborhood smoothing mechanism of self-supervised GNNs. To address these issues, we propose a $\textbf{D}$ual-branch $\textbf{S}$patial-$\textbf{T}$emporal self-supervised representation framework for enhanced road representations, termed as DST. On one hand, DST designs a mix-hop transition matrix for graph convolution to incorporate dynamic relations of roads from trajectories. Besides, DST contrasts road representations of the vanilla road network against that of the hypergraph in a spatial self-supervised way. The hypergraph is newly built based on three types of hyperedges to capture long-range relations. On the other hand, DST performs next token prediction as the temporal self-supervised task on the sequences of traffic dynamics based on a causal Transformer, which is further regularized by differentiating traffic modes of weekdays from those of weekends. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art methods verify the superiority of our proposed framework. Moreover, the comprehensive spatiotemporal modeling facilitates DST to excel in zero-shot learning scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Existing numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems predict future atmospheric states at fixed locations, which are called NWP grid points, by analyzing previous atmospheric states and newly acquired Earth observations. However, the shifting locations of observations and the surrounding meteorological context induce complex, dynamic spatial correlations that are difficult for traditional NWP systems to capture, since they rely on strict statistical and physical formulations. To handle complicated spatial correlations, which change dynamically, we employ a spatiotemporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) with structure learning. However, structure learning has an inherent limitation that this can cause structural information loss and over-smoothing problem by generating excessive edges. To solve this problem, we regulate edge sampling by adaptively determining node degrees and considering the spatial distances between NWP grid points and observations. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method (CloudNine-v2) using real-world atmospheric state and observation data from East Asia, achieving up to 15\% reductions in RMSE over existing STGNN models. Even in areas with high atmospheric variability, CloudNine-v2 consistently outperformed baselines with and without structure learning.</p></details> | 8 pages |

However, the effectiveness of traditional GNNs degrades on heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes often belong to different labels or properties. While recent work has introduced mechanisms to improve GNN performance under heterophily, certain key limitations still exist. Most existing models apply a fixed aggregation depth across all nodes, overlooking the fact that nodes may require different propagation depths based on their local homophily levels and neighborhood structures. Moreover, many methods are tailored to either homophilic or heterophilic settings, lacking the flexibility to generalize across both regimes. To address these challenges, we develop a theoretical framework that links local structural and label characteristics to information propagation dynamics at the node level. Our analysis shows that optimal aggregation depth varies across nodes and is critical for preserving class-discriminative information. Guided by this insight, we propose a novel adaptive-depth GNN architecture that dynamically selects node-specific aggregation depths using theoretically grounded metrics. Our method seamlessly adapts to both homophilic and heterophilic patterns within a unified model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances the performance of standard GNN backbones across diverse benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

However, we find that most social media posts, along with the public sentiment they reflect, provide limited value for trading predictions due to their noisy nature. To tackle this, we propose a novel dynamic expert tracing algorithm that filters out non-informative posts and identifies both true and inverse experts whose consistent predictions can serve as valuable trading signals. Our approach achieves significant improvements over existing expert identification methods in stock trend prediction. However, when using binary expert predictions to predict the return ratio, similar to all other expert identification methods, our approach faces a common challenge of signal sparsity with expert signals cover only about 4% of all stock-day combinations in our dataset. To address this challenge, we propose a dual graph attention neural network that effectively propagates expert signals across related stocks, enabling accurate prediction of return ratios and significantly increasing signal coverage. Empirical results show that our propagated expert-based signals not only exhibit strong predictive power independently but also work synergistically with traditional financial features. These combined signals significantly outperform representative baseline models in all quant-related metrics including predictive accuracy, return metrics, and correlation metrics, resulting in more robust investment strategies. We hope this work inspires further research into leveraging social media data for enhancing quantitative investment strategies.

However, in deep architectures, this process often leads to diminished expressiveness. A popular solution is to use residual connections, where the input from the current (or initial) layer is added to aggregated neighbor information to preserve embeddings across layers. Following a recent line of research, we investigate an adaptive residual scheme in which different nodes have varying residual strengths. We prove that this approach prevents oversmoothing; particularly, we show that the Dirichlet energy of the embeddings remains bounded away from zero. This is the first theoretical guarantee not only for the adaptive setting, but also for static residual connections (where residual strengths are shared across nodes) with activation functions. Furthermore, extensive experiments show that this adaptive approach outperforms standard and state-of-the-art message passing mechanisms, especially on heterophilic graphs. To improve the time complexity of our approach, we introduce a variant in which residual strengths are not learned but instead set heuristically, a choice that performs as well as the learnable version.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the full version of the paper accepted to the 40th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-2026)</p></details> |

To address this issue, we propose Channel Capacity Constrained Estimation (C3E), a novel framework that formulates the selection of hidden dimensions and depth as a nonlinear programming problem grounded in information theory. Through modeling spectral graph neural networks as communication channels, our approach directly connects channel capacity to hidden dimensions, propagation depth, propagation mechanism, and graph structure. Extensive experiments on nine public datasets demonstrate that hidden dimensions and depths estimated by C3E can mitigate over-squashing and consistently improve representation learning. Experimental results show that over-squashing occurs due to the cumulative compression of information in representation matrices. Furthermore, our findings show that increasing hidden dimensions indeed mitigate information compression, while the role of propagation depth is more nuanced, uncovering a fundamental balance between information compression and representation complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 11 figures.

| **[On the Cross-type Homophily of Heterogeneous Graphs: Understanding and Unleashing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14600v2)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Homophily, the tendency of similar nodes to connect, is a fundamental phenomenon in network science and a critical factor in the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs). While existing studies primarily explore homophily in homogeneous graphs, where nodes share the same type, real-world networks are often more accurately modeled as heterogeneous graphs (HGs) with diverse node types and intricate cross-type interactions. This structural diversity complicates the analysis of homophily, as traditional homophily metrics fail to account for distinct label spaces across node types. To address this limitation, we introduce the Cross-Type Homophily Ratio (CHR), a novel metric that quantifies homophily based on the similarity of target information across different node types. Additionally, we propose Cross-Type Homophily-guided Graph Editing (CTHGE), a novel method for improving heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) performance by optimizing cross-type connectivity using Cross-Type Homophily Ratio. Extensive experiments on five HG datasets with nine HGNNs validate the effectiveness of CTHGE, which delivers a maximum relative performance improvement of over 25% for HGNNs on node classification tasks, offering a fresh perspective on cross-type homophily in HGs learning.</p></details> | CIKM 2026 |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning for Fair and Efficient Urban Traffic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06363v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The optimization of urban traffic is threatened by the complexity of achieving a balance between transport efficiency and the maintenance of privacy, as well as the equitable distribution of traffic based on socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods. Current centralized traffic management schemes invade user location privacy and further entrench traffic disparity by offering disadvantaged route suggestions, whereas current federated learning frameworks do not consider fairness constraints in multi-objective traffic settings. This study presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework, termed FedFair-Traffic, that jointly and simultaneously optimizes travel efficiency, traffic fairness, and differential privacy protection. This is the first attempt to integrate three conflicting objectives to improve urban transportation systems. The proposed methodology enables collaborative learning between related vehicles with data locality by integrating Graph Neural Networks with differential privacy mechanisms ($ε$-privacy guarantees) and Gini coefficient-based fair constraints using multi-objective optimization. The framework uses federated aggregation methods of gradient clipping and noise injection to provide differential privacy and optimize Pareto-efficient solutions for the efficiency-fairness tradeoff. Real-world comprehensive experiments on the METR-LA traffic dataset showed that FedFair-Traffic can reduce the average travel time by 7\% (14.2 minutes) compared with their centralized baselines, promote traffic fairness by 73\% (Gini coefficient, 0.78), and offer high privacy protection (privacy score, 0.8) with an 89\% reduction in communication overhead. These outcomes demonstrate that FedFair-Traffic is a scalable privacy-aware smart city infrastructure with possible use-cases in metropolitan traffic flow control and federated transportation networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at IEEE journal</p></details> |
| **[Sheaf Graph Neural Networks via PAC-Bayes Spectral Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00357v2)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) causes collapse in distinct node features, particularly on heterophilic graphs where adjacent nodes often have dissimilar labels. Although sheaf neural networks partially mitigate this problem, they typically rely on static or heavily parameterized sheaf structures that hinder generalization and scalability. Existing sheaf-based models either predefine restriction maps or introduce excessive complexity, yet fail to provide rigorous stability guarantees. In this paper, we introduce a novel scheme called SGPC (Sheaf GNNs with PAC-Bayes Calibration), a unified architecture that combines cellular-sheaf message passing with several mechanisms, including optimal transport-based lifting, variance-reduced diffusion, and PAC-Bayes spectral regularization for robust semi-supervised node classification. We establish performance bounds theoretically and demonstrate that end-to-end training in linear computational complexity can achieve the resulting bound-aware objective. Experiments on nine homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks show that SGPC outperforms state-of-the-art spectral and sheaf-based GNNs while providing certified confidence intervals on unseen nodes.

| **[Enhancing Multimodal Misinformation Detection by Replaying the Whole Story from Image Modality Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06284v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) refers to the task of detecting social media posts involving misinformation, where the post often contains text and image modalities. However, by observing the MMD posts, we hold that the text modality may be much more informative than the image modality because the text generally describes the whole event/story of the current post but the image often presents partial scenes only. Our preliminary empirical results indicate that the image modality exactly contributes less to MMD. Upon this idea, we propose a new MMD method named RETSIMD. Specifically, we suppose that each text can be divided into several segments, and each text segment describes a partial scene that can be presented by an image. Accordingly, we split the text into a sequence of segments, and feed these segments into a pre-trained text-to-image generator to augment a sequence of images. We further incorporate two auxiliary objectives concerning text-image and image-label mutual information, and further post-train the generator over an auxiliary text-to-image generation benchmark dataset. Additionally, we propose a graph structure by defining three heuristic relationships between images, and use a graph neural network to generate the fused features. Extensive empirical results validate the effectiveness of RETSIMD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026. 13 pages, 6 figures.

Existing methods typically rely on fixed, handcrafted views-usually a local and a global perspective, which limits their ability to capture multi-scale structural patterns. We present an augmentation-free, multi-view GCL framework grounded in fractional-order continuous dynamics. By varying the fractional derivative order $α\in (0,1]$, our encoders produce a continuous spectrum of views: small $α$ yields localized features, while large $α$ induces broader, global aggregation. We treat $α$ as a learnable parameter so the model can adapt diffusion scales to the data and automatically discover informative views. This principled approach generates diverse, complementary representations without manual augmentations. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method produces more robust and expressive embeddings and outperforms state-of-the-art GCL baselines.</p></details> | Submitted to TPAMI |

Accurate and timely inference of supply chain resilience the capability to maintain core functions during disruptions is crucial for proactive risk mitigation and robust network design. However, existing approaches lack effective mechanisms to infer supply chain resilience without explicit system dynamics and struggle to represent the higher-order, multi-entity dependencies inherent in supply chain networks. These limitations motivate the definition of a novel problem and the development of targeted modeling solutions. To address these challenges, we formalize a novel problem: Supply Chain Resilience Inference (SCRI), defined as predicting supply chain resilience using hypergraph topology and observed inventory trajectories without explicit dynamic equations. To solve this problem, we propose the Supply Chain Resilience Inference Hypergraph Network (SC-RIHN), a novel hypergraph-based model leveraging set-based encoding and hypergraph message passing to capture multi-party firm-product interactions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SC-RIHN significantly outperforms traditional MLP, representative graph neural network variants, and ResInf baselines across synthetic benchmarks, underscoring its potential for practical, early-warning risk assessment in complex supply chain systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Graph Laplacian Eigenvector-based Pre-training Method for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02803v3)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of self-supervised graph pre-training methods is a crucial ingredient in recent efforts to design robust graph foundation models (GFMs). Structure-based pre-training methods are under-explored yet crucial for downstream applications which rely on underlying graph structure. In addition, pre-training traditional message passing GNNs to capture global and regional structure is often challenging due to the risk of oversmoothing as network depth increases. We address these gaps by proposing the Laplacian Eigenvector Learning Module (LELM), a novel pre-training module for graph neural networks (GNNs) based on predicting the low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. Moreover, LELM introduces a novel architecture that overcomes oversmoothing, allowing the GNN model to learn long-range interdependencies. Empirically, we show that models pre-trained via our framework outperform baseline models on downstream molecular property prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Up without Fading Out: Goal-Aware Sparse GNN for RL-based Generalized Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10747v3)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalized planning using deep reinforcement learning (RL) combined with graph neural networks (GNNs) has shown promising results in various symbolic planning domains described by PDDL. However, existing approaches typically represent planning states as fully connected graphs, leading to a combinatorial explosion in edge information and substantial sparsity as problem scales grow, especially evident in large grid-based environments. This dense representation results in diluted node-level information, exponentially increases memory requirements, and ultimately makes learning infeasible for larger-scale problems. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse, goal-aware GNN representation that selectively encodes relevant local relationships and explicitly integrates spatial features related to the goal. We validate our approach by designing novel drone mission scenarios based on PDDL within a grid world, effectively simulating realistic mission execution environments. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method scales effectively to larger grid sizes previously infeasible with dense graph representations and substantially improves policy generalization and success rates. Our findings provide a practical foundation for addressing realistic, large-scale generalized planning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in International Journal of Control, Automation, and Systems (IJCAS).

| **[Enhancing Robustness of Graph Neural Networks through p-Laplacian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06143v1)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increase of data in day-to-day life, businesses and different stakeholders need to analyze the data for better predictions. Traditionally, relational data has been a source of various insights, but with the increase in computational power and the need to understand deeper relationships between entities, the need to design new techniques has arisen. For this graph data analysis has become an extraordinary tool for understanding the data, which reveals more realistic and flexible modelling of complex relationships. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in various applications, such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, drug discovery, and more. However, many adversarial attacks can happen over the data, whether during training (poisoning attack) or during testing (evasion attack), which can adversely manipulate the desired outcome from the GNN model. Therefore, it is crucial to make the GNNs robust to such attacks. The existing robustness methods are computationally demanding and perform poorly when the intensity of attack increases. This paper presents a computationally efficient framework, namely, pLAPGNN, based on weighted p-Laplacian for making GNNs robust. Empirical evaluation on real datasets establishes the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 5th Workshop on Graphs and more Complex Structures For Learning and Reasoning (GCLR), The 40th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-26)</p></details> |
| **[Reperio-rPPG: Relational Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Periodicity Learning in Remote Physiological Measurement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05946v1)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is an emerging contactless physiological sensing technique that leverages subtle color variations in facial videos to estimate vital signs such as heart rate and respiratory rate. This non-invasive method has gained traction across diverse domains, including telemedicine, affective computing, driver fatigue detection, and health monitoring, owing to its scalability and convenience. Despite significant progress in remote physiological signal measurement, a crucial characteristic - the intrinsic periodicity - has often been underexplored or insufficiently modeled in previous approaches, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained temporal dynamics under real-world conditions. To bridge this gap, we propose Reperio-rPPG, a novel framework that strategically integrates Relational Convolutional Networks with a Graph Transformer to effectively capture the periodic structure inherent in physiological signals. Additionally, recognizing the limited diversity of existing rPPG datasets, we further introduce a tailored CutMix augmentation to enhance the model's generalizability. Extensive experiments conducted on three widely used benchmark datasets - PURE, UBFC-rPPG, and MMPD - demonstrate that Reperio-rPPG not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also exhibits remarkable robustness under various motion (e.g., stationary, rotation, talking, walking) and illumination conditions (e.g., nature, low LED, high LED).

| **[MoEGCL: Mixture of Ego-Graphs Contrastive Representation Learning for Multi-View Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05876v1)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the advancement of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has significantly propelled progress in Multi-View Clustering (MVC). However, existing methods face the problem of coarse-grained graph fusion. Specifically, current approaches typically generate a separate graph structure for each view and then perform weighted fusion of graph structures at the view level, which is a relatively rough strategy. To address this limitation, we present a novel Mixture of Ego-Graphs Contrastive Representation Learning (MoEGCL). It mainly consists of two modules. In particular, we propose an innovative Mixture of Ego-Graphs Fusion (MoEGF), which constructs ego graphs and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts network to implement fine-grained fusion of ego graphs at the sample level, rather than the conventional view-level fusion. Additionally, we present the Ego Graph Contrastive Learning (EGCL) module to align the fused representation with the view-specific representation. The EGCL module enhances the representation similarity of samples from the same cluster, not merely from the same sample, further boosting fine-grained graph representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoEGCL achieves state-of-the-art results in deep multi-view clustering tasks.

| **[Resolving Indirect Calls in Binary Code via Cross-Reference Augmented Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18801v2)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary code analysis is essential in scenarios where source code is unavailable, with extensive applications across various security domains. However, accurately resolving indirect call targets remains a longstanding challenge in maintaining the integrity of static analysis in binary code. This difficulty arises because the operand of a call instruction (e.g., call rax) remains unknown until runtime, resulting in an incomplete inter-procedural control flow graph (CFG). Previous approaches have struggled with low accuracy and limited scalability. To address these limitations, recent work has increasingly turned to machine learning (ML) to enhance analysis. However, this ML-driven approach faces two significant obstacles: low-quality callsite-callee training pairs and inadequate binary code representation, both of which undermine the accuracy of ML models. In this paper, we introduce CupidCall, a novel approach for resolving indirect calls using graph neural networks. Existing ML models in this area often overlook key elements such as data and code cross-references, which are essential for understanding a program's control flow. In contrast, CupidCall augments CFGs with cross-references, preserving rich semantic information. Additionally, we leverage advanced compiler-level type analysis to generate high-quality callsite-callee training pairs, enhancing model precision and reliability. We further design a graph neural model that leverages augmented CFGs and relational graph convolutions for accurate target prediction. Evaluated against real-world binaries from GitHub and the Arch User Repository on x86_64 architecture, CupidCall achieves an F1 score of 95.2%, outperforming state-of-the-art ML-based approaches. These results highlight CupidCall's effectiveness in building precise inter-procedural CFGs and its potential to advance downstream binary analysis and security applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphCliff: Short-Long Range Gating for Subtle Differences but Critical Changes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03170v2)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantitative structure-activity relationship assumes a smooth relationship between molecular structure and biological activity. However, activity cliffs defined as pairs of structurally similar compounds with large potency differences break this continuity. Recent benchmarks targeting activity cliffs have revealed that classical machine learning models with extended connectivity fingerprints outperform graph neural networks. Our analysis shows that graph embeddings fail to adequately separate structurally similar molecules in the embedding space, making it difficult to distinguish between structurally similar but functionally different molecules. Despite this limitation, molecular graph structures are inherently expressive and attractive, as they preserve molecular topology. To preserve the structural representation of molecules as graphs, we propose a new model, GraphCliff, which integrates short- and long-range information through a gating mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphCliff consistently improves performance on both non-cliff and cliff compounds. Furthermore, layer-wise node embedding analyses reveal reduced over-smoothing and enhanced discriminative power relative to strong baseline graph models.</p></details> |  |

First, the large language model captures contextual dependencies and deep semantic representations of the input text, providing a rich feature foundation for subsequent modeling. Then, based on multi-level feature representations, the feature pyramid mechanism effectively integrates semantic features of different scales, balancing global information and local details to construct hierarchical semantic expressions. Furthermore, the fused features are transformed into graph representations, and graph neural networks are employed to capture latent semantic relations and logical dependencies in the text, enabling comprehensive modeling of complex interactions among semantic units. On this basis, the readout and classification modules generate the final category predictions. The proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in robustness alignment experiments, outperforming existing models on ACC, F1-Score, AUC, and Precision, which verifies the effectiveness and stability of the framework. This study not only constructs an integrated framework that balances global and local information as well as semantics and structure, but also provides a new perspective for multi-scale feature fusion and structured semantic modeling in text classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

While recent deep learning approaches have shown promise, they often process sequence and structure information independently, failing to capture the intricate coupling between local structural geometry and global sequential patterns. We present DGTN (Diffused Graph-Transformer Network), a novel architecture that co-learns graph neural network (GNN) weights for structural priors and transformer attention through a diffusion mechanism. Our key innovation is a bidirectional diffusion process where: (1) GNN-derived structural embeddings guide transformer attention via learnable diffusion kernels, and (2) transformer representations refine GNN message passing through attention-modulated graph updates. We provide rigorous mathematical analysis showing this co-learning scheme achieves provably better approximation bounds than independent processing. On ProTherm and SKEMPI benchmarks, DGTN achieves state-of-the-art performance (Pearson Rho = 0.87, RMSE = 1.21 kcal/mol), with 6.2% improvement over best baselines. Ablation studies confirm the diffusion mechanism contributes 4.8 points to correlation. Our theoretical analysis proves the diffused attention converges to optimal structure-sequence coupling, with convergence rate O(1/sqrt(T) ) where T is diffusion steps. This work establishes a principled framework for integrating heterogeneous protein representations through learnable diffusion.</p></details> |  |

Learned Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer a promising alternative to traditional mesh-based physics simulators. Their speed and inherent differentiability make them particularly well suited for applications that require fast and accurate simulations, such as robotic manipulation or manufacturing optimization. However, existing learned simulators typically rely on single-step observations, which limits their ability to exploit temporal context. Without this information, these models fail to infer, e.g., material properties. Further, they rely on auto-regressive rollouts, which quickly accumulate error for long trajectories. We instead frame mesh-based simulation as a trajectory-level meta-learning problem. Using Conditional Neural Processes, our method enables rapid adaptation to new simulation scenarios from limited initial data while capturing their latent simulation properties. We utilize movement primitives to directly predict fast, stable and accurate simulations from a single model call. The resulting approach, Movement-primitive Meta-MeshGraphNet (M3GN), provides higher simulation accuracy at a fraction of the runtime cost compared to state-of-the-art GNSs across several tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages.

While existing filtering and strategic deployment techniques optimize collected data volume at the edge, they overlook how variations in sampling frequencies and spatial coverage affect downstream model performance. In many forecasting models, incorporating data from additional sensors denoise predictions by providing broader spatial contexts. This interplay between sampling frequency, spatial coverage and different forecasting model architectures remain underexplored. This work presents a systematic study of forecasting models - classical models (VAR), neural networks (GRU, Transformer), spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs), and time series foundation models (TSFMs: Chronos Moirai, TimesFM) under varying spatial sensor nodes density and sampling intervals using real-world temperature data in a wireless sensor network. Our results show that STGNNs are effective when sensor deployments are sparse and sampling rate is moderate, leveraging spatial correlations via encoded graph structure to compensate for limited coverage. In contrast, TSFMs perform competitively at high frequencies but degrade when spatial coverage from neighboring sensors is reduced. Crucially, the multivariate TSFM Moirai outperforms all models by natively learning cross-sensor dependencies. These findings offer actionable insights for building efficient forecasting pipelines in spatio-temporal systems.

Its development began with early graph-theoretic methods, gaining significant momentum with the advent of graph neural networks (GNNs). Over the past decade, progress in scalable architectures, dynamic graph modeling, multimodal learning, generative AI, explainable AI (XAI), and responsible AI has broadened the applicability of graph learning to various challenging environments. Graph learning is significant due to its ability to model complex, non-Euclidean relationships that traditional machine learning struggles to capture, thus better supporting real-world applications ranging from drug discovery and fraud detection to recommender systems and scientific reasoning. However, challenges like scalability, generalization, heterogeneity, interpretability, and trustworthiness must be addressed to unlock its full potential. This survey provides a comprehensive introduction to graph learning, focusing on key dimensions including scalable, temporal, multimodal, generative, explainable, and responsible graph learning. We review state-of-the-art techniques for efficiently handling large-scale graphs, capturing dynamic temporal dependencies, integrating heterogeneous data modalities, generating novel graph samples, and enhancing interpretability to foster trust and transparency. We also explore ethical considerations, such as privacy and fairness, to ensure responsible deployment of graph learning models. Additionally, we identify and discuss emerging topics, highlighting recent integration of graph learning and other AI paradigms and offering insights into future directions. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of graph learning.</p></details> | 185 pages |

We provide a different score, aver, and observe, on a dataset with ground truth marking for association, that aver does do better at finding assciated pairs than tf-idf. This example involves finding associated vertices in a large graph and that may be an area where neural networks are not currently an obvious best choice. Beyond this one anecdote, we observe that (1) aver has a natural threshold for declaring pairs as unassociated while tf-idf does not, (2) aver can distinguish between pairs of documents for which tf-idf gives a score of 1.0, (3) aver can be applied to larger collections of documents than pairs while tf-idf cannot, and (4) that aver is derived from entropy under a simple statistical model while tf-idf is a construction designed to achieve a certain goal and hence aver may be more "natural." To be fair, we also observe that (1) writing down and computing the aver score for a pair is more complex than for tf-idf and (2) that the fact that the aver score is naturally scale-free makes it more complicated to interpret aver scores.</p></details> |  |

Standard Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) commonly optimize for the average error, underperforming on these uncommon but critical cases, with existing oversampling methods often distorting molecular topology. In this paper, we introduce SPECTRA, a Spectral Target-Aware graph augmentation framework that generates realistic molecular graphs in the spectral domain. SPECTRA (i) reconstructs multi-attribute molecular graphs from SMILES; (ii) aligns molecule pairs via (Fused) Gromov-Wasserstein couplings to obtain node correspondences; (iii) interpolates Laplacian eigenvalues, eigenvectors and node features in a stable share-basis; and (iv) reconstructs edges to synthesize physically plausible intermediates with interpolated targets. A rarity-aware budgeting scheme, derived from a kernel density estimation of labels, concentrates augmentation where data are scarce. Coupled with a spectral GNN using edge-aware Chebyshev convolutions, SPECTRA densifies underrepresented regions without degrading global accuracy. On benchmarks, SPECTRA consistently improves error in relevant target ranges while maintaining competitive overall MAE, and yields interpretable synthetic molecules whose structure reflects the underlying spectral geometry. Our results demonstrate that spectral, geometry-aware augmentation is an effective and efficient strategy for imbalanced molecular property regression.</p></details> |  |

This work presents the first simulation-based inference (SBI) pipeline that combines weak lensing and galaxy clustering maps in a realistic Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) configuration and serves as preparation for a forthcoming analysis of the survey data. We develop a scalable forward model based on the CosmoGridV1 suite of N-body simulations to generate over one million self-consistent mock realizations of DES Y3 at the map level. Leveraging this large dataset, we train deep graph convolutional neural networks on the full survey footprint in spherical geometry to learn low-dimensional features that approximately maximize mutual information with target parameters. These learned compressions enable neural density estimation of the implicit likelihood via normalizing flows in a ten-dimensional parameter space spanning cosmological $w$CDM, intrinsic alignment, and linear galaxy bias parameters, while marginalizing over baryonic, photometric redshift, and shear bias nuisances. To ensure robustness, we extensively validate our inference pipeline using synthetic observations derived from both systematic contaminations in our forward model and independent Buzzard galaxy catalogs. Our forecasts yield significant improvements in cosmological parameter constraints, achieving $2-3\times$ higher figures of merit in the $Ω_m - S_8$ plane relative to our implementation of baseline two-point statistics and effectively breaking parameter degeneracies through probe combination. These results demonstrate the potential of SBI analyses powered by deep learning for upcoming Stage-IV wide-field imaging surveys.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 14 figures, submitted</p></details> |
| **[Personalized Image Editing in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models via Collaborative Direct Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05616v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made remarkable strides in generating and editing high-fidelity images from text. Yet, these models remain fundamentally generic, failing to adapt to the nuanced aesthetic preferences of individual users. In this work, we present the first framework for personalized image editing in diffusion models, introducing Collaborative Direct Preference Optimization (C-DPO), a novel method that aligns image edits with user-specific preferences while leveraging collaborative signals from like-minded individuals. Our approach encodes each user as a node in a dynamic preference graph and learns embeddings via a lightweight graph neural network, enabling information sharing across users with overlapping visual tastes. We enhance a diffusion model's editing capabilities by integrating these personalized embeddings into a novel DPO objective, which jointly optimizes for individual alignment and neighborhood coherence. Comprehensive experiments, including user studies and quantitative benchmarks, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines in generating edits that are aligned with user preferences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at NeurIPS'25 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[SolarCrossFormer: Improving day-ahead Solar Irradiance Forecasting by Integrating Satellite Imagery and Ground Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15827v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate day-ahead forecasts of solar irradiance are required for the large-scale integration of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems into the power grid. However, current forecasting solutions lack the temporal and spatial resolution required by system operators. In this paper, we introduce SolarCrossFormer, a novel deep learning model for day-ahead irradiance forecasting, that combines satellite images and time series from a ground-based network of meteorological stations. SolarCrossFormer uses novel graph neural networks to exploit the inter- and intra-modal correlations of the input data and improve the accuracy and resolution of the forecasts. It generates probabilistic forecasts for any location in Switzerland with a 15-minute resolution for horizons up to 24 hours ahead. One of the key advantages of SolarCrossFormer its robustness in real life operations. It can incorporate new time-series data without retraining the model and, additionally, it can produce forecasts for locations without input data by using only their coordinates. Experimental results over a dataset of one year and 127 locations across Switzerland show that SolarCrossFormer yield a normalized mean absolute error of 6.1 % over the forecasting horizon. The results are competitive with those achieved by a commercial numerical weather prediction service.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 18 figures, accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy</p></details> |

To address these threats, we propose WaveGuard, a proactive watermarking framework that enhances robustness and imperceptibility via frequency-domain embedding and graph-based structural consistency. Specifically, we embed watermarks into high-frequency sub-bands using Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DT-CWT) and employ a Structural Consistency Graph Neural Network (SC-GNN) to preserve visual quality. We also design an attention module to refine embedding precision. Experimental results on face swap and reenactment tasks demonstrate that WaveGuard outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both robustness and visual quality.
