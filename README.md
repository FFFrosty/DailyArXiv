| **[Underactuated Robotic Hand with Grasp State Estimation Using Tendon-Based Proprioception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12969v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anthropomorphic underactuated hands are valued for their structural simplicity and inherent adaptability. However, the uncertainty arising from interdependent joint motions makes it challenging to capture various grasp states during hand-object interaction without increasing structural complexity through multiple embedded sensors. This motivates the need for an approach that can extract rich grasp-state information from a single sensing source while preserving the simplicity of underactuation. This study proposes an anthropomorphic underactuated hand that achieves comprehensive grasp state estimation, using only tendon-based proprioception provided by series elastic actuators (SEAs). Our approach is enabled by the design of a compact SEA with high accuracy and reliability that can be seamlessly integrated into sensorless fingers. By coupling accurate proprioceptive measurements with potential energy-based modeling, the system estimates multiple key grasp state variables, including contact timing, joint angles, relative object stiffness, and external disturbances. Finger-level experimental validations and extensive hand-level grasp functionality demonstrations confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach. These results highlight tendon-based proprioception as a compact and robust sensing modality for practical manipulation without reliance on vision or tactile feedback.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 15 figures, 3 tables, Supplementary video</p></details> |
| **[Uncovering Zero-Shot Generalization Gaps in Time-Series Foundation Models Using Real-World Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26347v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research on time-series foundation models (TSFMs) has underscored the scarcity of real-world data, often supplemented with synthetic sources in existing datasets, whose generalizability remains however debated. As such, in this work, we propose a novel benchmarking approach: in particular, we aim at building a curated dataset reflecting real world physical temporal dynamics, extracting temporal signals from real-world videos using optical flow. As such, we introduce REAL-V-TSFM, a novel dataset designed to capture rich and diverse time series derived from real-world videos. Experimental results on state-of-the-art TSFMs under zero-shot forecasting show that, despite strong performance on conventional benchmarks, these models exhibit performance degradation on the proposed dataset, suggesting limited generalizability to novel datasets. These findings underscore the need for novel approaches to acquiring time series data and highlight the lack of universality in recent TSFMs, while further validating the effectiveness of our video-based time series data extraction pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by Artificial Intelligence for Time Series Analysis (AI4TS) Workshop @ AAAI 2026: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical AI-Meteorologist: LLM-Agent System for Multi-Scale and Explainable Weather Forecast Reporting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23387v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the Hierarchical AI-Meteorologist, an LLM-agent system that generates explainable weather reports using a hierarchical forecast reasoning and weather keyword generation. Unlike standard approaches that treat forecasts as flat time series, our framework performs multi-scale reasoning across hourly, 6-hour, and daily aggregations to capture both short-term dynamics and long-term trends. Its core reasoning agent converts structured meteorological inputs into coherent narratives while simultaneously extracting a few keywords effectively summarizing the dominant meteorological events. These keywords serve as semantic anchors for validating consistency, temporal coherence and factual alignment of the generated reports. Using OpenWeather and Meteostat data, we demonstrate that hierarchical context and keyword-based validation substantially improve interpretability and robustness of LLM-generated weather narratives, offering a reproducible framework for semantic evaluation of automated meteorological reporting and advancing agent-based scientific reasoning.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Conjugate Generalised Bayesian Inference for Discrete Doubly Intractable Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23275v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Doubly intractable problems occur when both the likelihood and the posterior are available only in unnormalised form, with computationally intractable normalisation constants. Bayesian inference then typically requires direct approximation of the posterior through specialised and typically expensive MCMC methods. In this paper, we provide a computationally efficient alternative in the form of a novel generalised Bayesian posterior that allows for conjugate inference within the class of exponential family models for discrete data. We derive theoretical guarantees to characterise the asymptotic behaviour of the generalised posterior, supporting its use for inference. The method is evaluated on a range of challenging intractable exponential family models, including the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson graphical model of multivariate count data, autoregressive discrete time series models, and Markov random fields such as the Ising and Potts models. The computational gains are significant; in our experiments, the method is between 10 and 6000 times faster than state-of-the-art Bayesian computational methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretability for Time Series Transformers using A Concept Bottleneck Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06070v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mechanistic interpretability focuses on reverse engineering the internal mechanisms learned by neural networks. We extend our focus and propose to mechanistically forward engineer using our framework based on Concept Bottleneck Models. In the context of long-term time series forecasting, we modify the training objective to encourage a model to develop representations which are similar to predefined, interpretable concepts using Centered Kernel Alignment. This steers the bottleneck components to learn the predefined concepts, while allowing other components to learn other, undefined concepts. We apply the framework to the Vanilla Transformer, Autoformer and FEDformer, and present an in-depth analysis on synthetic data and on a variety of benchmark datasets. We find that the model performance remains mostly unaffected, while the model shows much improved interpretability. Additionally, we verify the interpretation of the bottleneck components with an intervention experiment using activation patching.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Series Forecasting via Direct Per-Step Probability Distribution Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23260v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural network-based time series prediction models have recently demonstrated superior capabilities in capturing complex temporal dependencies. However, it is challenging for these models to account for uncertainty associated with their predictions, because they directly output scalar values at each time step. To address such a challenge, we propose a novel model named interleaved dual-branch Probability Distribution Network (interPDN), which directly constructs discrete probability distributions per step instead of a scalar. The regression output at each time step is derived by computing the expectation of the predictive distribution on a predefined support set. To mitigate prediction anomalies, a dual-branch architecture is introduced with interleaved support sets, augmented by coarse temporal-scale branches for long-term trend forecasting. Outputs from another branch are treated as auxiliary signals to impose self-supervised consistency constraints on the current branch's prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of interPDN.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Towards Understanding Transformers in Learning Random Walks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23239v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have proven highly effective across various applications, especially in handling sequential data such as natural languages and time series. However, transformer models often lack clear interpretability, and the success of transformers has not been well understood in theory. In this paper, we study the capability and interpretability of transformers in learning a family of classic statistical models, namely random walks on circles. We theoretically demonstrate that, after training with gradient descent, a one-layer transformer model can achieve optimal accuracy in predicting random walks. Importantly, our analysis reveals that the trained model is interpretable: the trained softmax attention serves as a token selector, focusing on the direct parent state; subsequently, the value matrix executes a one-step probability transition to predict the location of the next state based on this parent state. We also show that certain edge cases not covered by our theory are indeed failure cases, demonstrating that our theoretical conditions are tight. By investigating these success and failure cases, it is revealed that gradient descent with small initialization may fail or struggle to converge to a good solution in certain simple tasks even beyond random walks. Experiments are conducted to support our theoretical findings.</p></details> | 45 pages, 13 figures |
| **[SDE-Attention: Latent Attention in SDE-RNNs for Irregularly Sampled Time Series with Missing Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23238v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregularly sampled time series with substantial missing observations are common in healthcare and sensor networks. We introduce SDE-Attention, a family of SDE-RNNs equipped with channel-level attention on the latent pre-RNN state, including channel recalibration, time-varying feature attention, and pyramidal multi-scale self-attention. We therefore conduct a comparison on a synthetic periodic dataset and real-world benchmarks, under varying missing rate. Latent-space attention consistently improves over a vanilla SDE-RNN. On the univariate UCR datasets, the LSTM-based time-varying feature model SDE-TVF-L achieves the highest average accuracy, raising mean performance by approximately 4, 6, and 10 percentage points over the baseline at 30%, 60% and 90% missingness, respectively (averaged across datasets). On multivariate UEA benchmarks, attention-augmented models again outperform the backbone, with SDE-TVF-L yielding up to a 7% gain in mean accuracy under high missingness. Among the proposed mechanisms, time-varying feature attention is the most robust on univariate datasets. On multivariate datasets, different attention types excel on different tasks, showing that SDE-Attention can be flexibly adapted to the structure of each problem.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Field-programmable dynamics in a soft magnetic actuator enabling true random number generation and reservoir computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23215v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex and even chaotic dynamics, though prevalent in many natural and engineered systems, has been largely avoided in the design of electromechanical systems due to concerns about wear and controlability. Here, we demonstrate that complex dynamics might be particularly advantageous in soft robotics, offering new functionalities beyond motion not easily achievable with traditional actuation methods. We designed and realized resilient magnetic soft actuators capable of operating in a tunable dynamic regime for tens of thousands cycles without fatigue. We experimentally demonstrated the application of these actuators for true random number generation and stochastic computing. {W}e validate soft robots as physical reservoirs capable of performing Mackey--Glass time series prediction. These findings show that exploring the complex dynamics in soft robotics would extend the application scenarios in soft computing, human-robot interaction and collaborative robots as we demonstrate with biomimetic blinking and randomized voice modulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Delta-XAI: A Unified Framework for Explaining Prediction Changes in Online Time Series Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23036v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explaining online time series monitoring models is crucial across sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance, where temporal and contextual prediction dynamics underpin critical decisions. While recent XAI methods have improved the explainability of time series models, they mostly analyze each time step independently, overlooking temporal dependencies. This results in further challenges: explaining prediction changes is non-trivial, methods fail to leverage online dynamics, and evaluation remains difficult. To address these challenges, we propose Delta-XAI, which adapts 14 existing XAI methods through a wrapper function and introduces a principled evaluation suite for the online setting, assessing diverse aspects, such as faithfulness, sufficiency, and coherence. Experiments reveal that classical gradient-based methods, such as Integrated Gradients (IG), can outperform recent approaches when adapted for temporal analysis. Building on this, we propose Shifted Window Integrated Gradients (SWING), which incorporates past observations in the integration path to systematically capture temporal dependencies and mitigate out-of-distribution effects. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of SWING across diverse settings with respect to diverse metrics. Our code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Delta-XAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[YARE-GAN: Yet Another Resting State EEG-GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02636v4)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Resting-state EEG offers a non-invasive view of spontaneous brain activity, yet the extraction of meaningful patterns is often constrained by limited availability of high-quality data, and heavy reliance on manually engineered EEG features. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) offer not only a means to synthesize and augment neural signals, but also a promising way for learning meaningful representations directly from raw data, a dual capability that remains largely unexplored in EEG research. In this study, we introduce a scalable GAN-based framework for resting-state EEG that serves this dual role: 1) synthesis and 2) unsupervised feature extraction. The generated time series closely replicate key statistical and spectral properties of real EEG, as validated through both visual and quantitative evaluations. Importantly, we demonstrate that the model's learned representations can be repurposed for a downstream gender classification task, achieving higher out-of-sample accuracy than models trained directly on EEG signals and performing comparably to recent EEG foundation models, while using significantly less data and computational resources. These findings highlight the potential of generative models to serve as both neural signal generators and unsupervised feature extractors, paving the way for more data-efficient, architecture-driven approaches to EEG analysis with reduced reliance on manual feature engineering. The implementation code for this study is available at: https://github.com/Yeganehfrh/YARE-GAN.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Trainable Centrality Framework for Modern Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22959v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Measuring how central or typical a data point is underpins robust estimation, ranking, and outlier detection, but classical depth notions become expensive and unstable in high dimensions and are hard to extend beyond Euclidean data. We introduce Fused Unified centrality Score Estimation (FUSE), a neural centrality framework that operates on top of arbitrary representations. FUSE combines a global head, trained from pairwise distance-based comparisons to learn an anchor-free centrality score, with a local head, trained by denoising score matching to approximate a smoothed log-density potential. A single parameter between 0 and 1 interpolates between these calibrated signals, yielding depth-like centrality from different views via one forward pass. Across synthetic distributions, real images, time series, and text data, and standard outlier detection benchmarks, FUSE recovers meaningful classical ordering, reveals multi-scale geometric structures, and attains competitive performance with strong classical baselines while remaining simple and efficient.</p></details> |  |
| **[Counterfactual Explanation for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Exogenous Variables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06906v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, machine learning is widely used across various domains, including time series data analysis. However, some machine learning models function as black boxes, making interpretability a critical concern. One approach to address this issue is counterfactual explanation (CE), which aims to provide insights into model predictions. This study focuses on the relatively underexplored problem of generating counterfactual explanations for time series forecasting. We propose a method for extracting CEs in time series forecasting using exogenous variables, which are frequently encountered in fields such as business and marketing. In addition, we present methods for analyzing the influence of each variable over an entire time series, generating CEs by altering only specific variables, and evaluating the quality of the resulting CEs. We validate the proposed method through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments, showcasing its accuracy and practical applicability. These contributions are expected to support real-world decision-making based on time series data analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>27pag...</summary><p>27pages,9figures,9tables</p></details> |
| **[Atom of Thoughts for Markov LLM Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12018v3)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve superior performance through training-time scaling, and test-time scaling further enhances their capabilities by conducting effective reasoning during inference. However, as the scale of reasoning increases, existing test-time scaling methods suffer from accumulated historical information, which not only wastes computational resources but also interferes with effective reasoning. To address this issue, we observe that complex reasoning can be achieved by solving a series of independent and self-contained subquestions. These subquestions are essentially \textit{atomic questions}, exhibiting the memoryless property similar to Markov processes. Based on this observation, we propose Atom of Thoughts (\our), where each state transition consists of decomposing the current question into a dependency-based directed acyclic graph and contracting its subquestions, forming a simplified question that maintains answer equivalence with the original problem. This answer preservation enables the iterative \textit{decomposition-contraction} process to naturally form a meaningful Markov reasoning process. Furthermore, these atomic states can be seamlessly integrated into existing test-time scaling methods, enabling \our to serve as a plug-in enhancement for improving reasoning capabilities. Experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of \our both as a standalone framework and a plug-in enhancement. Notably, on HotpotQA, when applied to gpt-4o-mini, \our achieves an \textbf{80.6\%} F1 score, surpassing o3-mini by \textbf{3.4\%} and DeepSeek-R1 by \textbf{10.6\%}.

| **[TARFVAE: Efficient One-Step Generative Time Series Forecasting via TARFLOW based VAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22853v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data is ubiquitous, with forecasting applications spanning from finance to healthcare. Beyond popular deterministic methods, generative models are gaining attention due to advancements in areas like image synthesis and video generation, as well as their inherent ability to provide probabilistic predictions. However, existing generative approaches mostly involve recurrent generative operations or repeated denoising steps, making the prediction laborious, particularly for long-term forecasting. Most of them only conduct experiments for relatively short-term forecasting, with limited comparison to deterministic methods in long-term forecasting, leaving their practical advantages unclear. This paper presents TARFVAE, a novel generative framework that combines the Transformer-based autoregressive flow (TARFLOW) and variational autoencoder (VAE) for efficient one-step generative time series forecasting. Inspired by the rethinking that complex architectures for extracting time series representations might not be necessary, we add a flow module, TARFLOW, to VAE to promote spontaneous learning of latent variables that benefit predictions. TARFLOW enhances VAE's posterior estimation by breaking the Gaussian assumption, thereby enabling a more informative latent space. TARFVAE uses only the forward process of TARFLOW, avoiding autoregressive inverse operations and thus ensuring fast generation. During generation, it samples from the prior latent space and directly generates full-horizon forecasts via the VAE decoder. With simple MLP modules, TARFVAE achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art deterministic and generative models across different forecast horizons on benchmark datasets while maintaining efficient prediction speed, demonstrating its effectiveness as an efficient and powerful solution for generative time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gaussian approximations for fast Bayesian inference of partially observed branching processes with applications to epidemiology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22833v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of inference for the states and parameters of a continuous-time multitype branching process from partially observed time series data. Exact inference for this class of models, typically using sequential Monte Carlo, can be computationally challenging when the populations that are being modelled grow exponentially or the time series is long. Instead, we derive a Gaussian approximation for the transition function of the process that leads to a Kalman filtering algorithm that runs in a time independent of the population sizes. We also develop a hybrid approach for when populations are smaller and the approximation is less applicable. We investigate the performance of our approximation and algorithms to both a simple and a complex epidemic model, finding good adherence to the true posterior distributions in both cases with large computational speed-ups in most cases. We also apply our method to a COVID-19 dataset with time dependent parameters where exact methods are intractable due to the population sizes involved.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Masquerade Attacks in Controller Area Networks Using Graph Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05427v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern vehicles rely on a myriad of electronic control units (ECUs) interconnected via controller area networks (CANs) for critical operations. Despite their ubiquitous use and reliability, CANs are susceptible to sophisticated cyberattacks, particularly masquerade attacks, which inject false data that mimic legitimate messages at the expected frequency. These attacks pose severe risks such as unintended acceleration, brake deactivation, and rogue steering. Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) often struggle to detect these subtle intrusions due to their seamless integration into normal traffic. This paper introduces a novel framework for detecting masquerade attacks in the CAN bus using graph machine learning (ML). We hypothesize that the integration of shallow graph embeddings with time series features derived from CAN frames enhances the detection of masquerade attacks. We show that by representing CAN bus frames as message sequence graphs (MSGs) and enriching each node with contextual statistical attributes from time series, we can enhance detection capabilities across various attack patterns compared to using graph-based features only. Our method ensures a comprehensive and dynamic analysis of CAN frame interactions, improving robustness and efficiency. Extensive experiments on the ROAD dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating statistically significant improvements in the detection rates of masquerade attacks compared to a baseline that uses graph-based features only as confirmed by Mann-Whitney U and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests p < 0.05.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modèles de Fondation et Ajustement : Vers une Nouvelle Génération de Modèles pour la Prévision des Séries Temporelles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22674v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by recent advances in large language models, foundation models have been developed for zero-shot time series forecasting, enabling prediction on datasets unseen during pretraining. These large-scale models, trained on vast collections of time series, learn generalizable representations for both point and probabilistic forecasting, reducing the need for task-specific architectures and manual tuning. In this work, we review the main architectures, pretraining strategies, and optimization methods used in such models, and study the effect of fine-tuning after pretraining to enhance their performance on specific datasets. Our empirical results show that fine-tuning generally improves zero-shot forecasting capabilities, especially for long-term horizons.</p></details> | in French language |
| **[Chain-of-Influence: Tracing Interdependencies Across Time and Features in Clinical Predictive Modelings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09895v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling clinical time-series data is hampered by the challenge of capturing latent, time-varying dependencies among features. State-of-the-art approaches often rely on black-box mechanisms or simple aggregation, failing to explicitly model how the influence of one clinical variable propagates through others over time. We propose $\textbf{Chain-of-Influence (CoI)}$, an interpretable deep learning framework that constructs an explicit, time-unfolded graph of feature interactions. CoI enables the tracing of influence pathways, providing a granular audit trail that shows how any feature at any time contributes to the final prediction, both directly and through its influence on other variables. We evaluate CoI on mortality and disease progression tasks using the MIMIC-IV dataset and a chronic kidney disease cohort. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance (AUROC of 0.960 on CKD progression and 0.950 on ICU mortality), with deletion-based sensitivity analyses confirming that CoI's learned attributions faithfully reflect its decision process. Through case studies, we demonstrate that CoI uncovers clinically meaningful, patient-specific patterns of disease progression, offering enhanced transparency into the temporal and cross-feature dependencies that inform clinical decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Framework for Initial Transient Detection and Statistical Assessment of Convergence in CFD Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22618v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data often contain initial transient periods before reaching a stable state, posing challenges in analysis and interpretation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect and estimate the end of the initial transient in time series data. Our method leverages the reversal mean standard error (RMSE) as a metric for assessing the stability of the data. Additionally, we employ fractional filtering techniques to enhance the detection accuracy by filtering out noise and capturing essential features of the underlying dynamics. Combining with autocorrelation-corrected confidence intervals we provide a robust framework to automate transient detection and convergence assessment. The method ensures statistical rigor by accounting for autocorrelation effects, validated through simulations with varying time steps. Results demonstrate independence from numerical parameters (e.g., time step size, under-relaxation factors), offering a reliable tool for steady-state analysis. The framework is lightweight, generalizable, and mitigates inflated false positives in autocorrelated datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, chemical datasets are often inaccessible to the machine learning community as they tend to require cleaning, thorough understanding of the chemistry, or are simply not available. In this paper, we introduce a novel dataset for yield prediction, providing the first-ever transient flow dataset for machine learning benchmarking, covering over 1200 process conditions. While previous datasets focus on discrete parameters, our experimental set-up allow us to sample a large number of continuous process conditions, generating new challenges for machine learning models. We focus on solvent selection, a task that is particularly difficult to model theoretically and therefore ripe for machine learning applications. We showcase benchmarking for regression algorithms, transfer-learning approaches, feature engineering, and active learning, with important applications towards solvent replacement and sustainable manufacturing.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages main, 22 pages total, 8 figures, 7 tables.

| **[TS2Vec-Ensemble: An Enhanced Self-Supervised Framework for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22395v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised representation learning, particularly through contrastive methods like TS2Vec, has advanced the analysis of time series data. However, these models often falter in forecasting tasks because their objective functions prioritize instance discrimination over capturing the deterministic patterns, such as seasonality and trend, that are critical for accurate prediction. This paper introduces TS2Vec-Ensemble, a novel hybrid framework designed to bridge this gap. Our approach enhances the powerful, implicitly learned dynamics from a pretrained TS2Vec encoder by fusing them with explicit, engineered time features that encode periodic cycles. This fusion is achieved through a dual-model ensemble architecture, where two distinct regression heads -- one focused on learned dynamics and the other on seasonal patterns -- are combined using an adaptive weighting scheme. The ensemble weights are optimized independently for each forecast horizon, allowing the model to dynamically prioritize short-term dynamics or long-term seasonality as needed. We conduct extensive experiments on the ETT benchmark datasets for both univariate and multivariate forecasting. The results demonstrate that TS2Vec-Ensemble consistently and significantly outperforms the standard TS2Vec baseline and other state-of-the-art models, validating our hypothesis that a hybrid of learned representations and explicit temporal priors is a superior strategy for long-horizon time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Qwen3-VL Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21631v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Qwen3-VL, the most capable vision-language model in the Qwen series to date, achieving superior performance across a broad range of multimodal benchmarks. It natively supports interleaved contexts of up to 256K tokens, seamlessly integrating text, images, and video. The model family includes both dense (2B/4B/8B/32B) and mixture-of-experts (30B-A3B/235B-A22B) variants to accommodate diverse latency-quality trade-offs. Qwen3-VL delivers three core pillars: (i) markedly stronger pure-text understanding, surpassing comparable text-only backbones in several cases; (ii) robust long-context comprehension with a native 256K-token window for both text and interleaved multimodal inputs, enabling faithful retention, retrieval, and cross-referencing across long documents and videos; and (iii) advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks, demonstrating leading performance on comprehensive evaluations such as MMMU and visual-math benchmarks (e.g., MathVista and MathVision). Architecturally, we introduce three key upgrades: (i) an enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for stronger spatial-temporal modeling across images and video; (ii) DeepStack integration, which effectively leverages multi-level ViT features to tighten vision-language alignment; and (iii) text-based time alignment for video, evolving from T-RoPE to explicit textual timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. Under comparable token budgets and latency constraints, Qwen3-VL achieves superior performance in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We envision Qwen3-VL serving as a foundational engine for image-grounded reasoning, agentic decision-making, and multimodal code intelligence in real-world workflows.</p></details> | 42 pages |
| **[Predicting and Interpolating Spatiotemporal Environmental Data: A Case Study of Groundwater Storage in Bangladesh](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22378v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geospatial observational datasets are often limited to point measurements, making temporal prediction and spatial interpolation essential for constructing continuous fields. This study evaluates two deep learning strategies for addressing this challenge: (1) a grid-to-grid approach, where gridded predictors are used to model rasterised targets (aggregation before modelling), and (2) a grid-to-point approach, where gridded predictors model point targets, followed by kriging interpolation to fill the domain (aggregation after modelling). Using groundwater storage data from Bangladesh as a case study, we compare the effcacy of these approaches. Our findings indicate that spatial interpolation is substantially more difficult than temporal prediction. In particular, nearest neighbours are not always the most similar, and uncertainties in geology strongly influence point temporal behaviour.

| **[RI-Loss: A Learnable Residual-Informed Loss for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10130v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting relies on predicting future values from historical data, yet most state-of-the-art approaches-including transformer and multilayer perceptron-based models-optimize using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which has two fundamental weaknesses: its point-wise error computation fails to capture temporal relationships, and it does not account for inherent noise in the data. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Residual-Informed Loss (RI-Loss), a novel objective function based on the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). RI-Loss explicitly models noise structure by enforcing dependence between the residual sequence and a random time series, enabling more robust, noise-aware representations. Theoretically, we derive the first non-asymptotic HSIC bound with explicit double-sample complexity terms, achieving optimal convergence rates through Bernstein-type concentration inequalities and Rademacher complexity analysis. This provides rigorous guarantees for RI-Loss optimization while precisely quantifying kernel space interactions. Empirically, experiments across eight real-world benchmarks and five leading forecasting models demonstrate improvements in predictive performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/shang-xl/RI-Loss.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond MSE: Ordinal Cross-Entropy for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10200v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is an important task that involves analyzing temporal dependencies and underlying patterns (such as trends, cyclicality, and seasonality) in historical data to predict future values or trends. Current deep learning-based forecasting models primarily employ Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss functions for regression modeling. Despite enabling direct value prediction, this method offers no uncertainty estimation and exhibits poor outlier robustness. To address these limitations, we propose OCE-TS, a novel ordinal classification approach for time series forecasting that replaces MSE with Ordinal Cross-Entropy (OCE) loss, preserving prediction order while quantifying uncertainty through probability output. Specifically, OCE-TS begins by discretizing observed values into ordered intervals and deriving their probabilities via a parametric distribution as supervision signals. Using a simple linear model, we then predict probability distributions for each timestep. The OCE loss is computed between the cumulative distributions of predicted and ground-truth probabilities, explicitly preserving ordinal relationships among forecasted values. Through theoretical analysis using influence functions, we establish that cross-entropy (CE) loss exhibits superior stability and outlier robustness compared to MSE loss. Empirically, we compared OCE-TS with five baseline models-Autoformer, DLinear, iTransformer, TimeXer, and TimeBridge-on seven public time series datasets. Using MSE and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as evaluation metrics, the results demonstrate that OCE-TS consistently outperforms benchmark models. The codeis publicly available at: https://github.com/Shi-hm/OCE-TS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diagnostic Checking for Wasserstein Autoregression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22274v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wasserstein autoregression provides a robust framework for modeling serial dependence among probability distributions, with wide-ranging applications in economics, finance, and climate science. In this paper, we develop portmanteau-type diagnostic tests for assessing the adequacy of Wasserstein autoregressive models. By defining autocorrelation functions for model errors and residuals in the Wasserstein space, we construct two related tests: one analogous to the classical McLeod type test, and the other based on the sample-splitting approach of Davis and Fernandes(2025). We establish that, under mild regularity conditions, the corresponding test statistics converge in distribution to chi-square limits. Simulation studies and empirical applications demonstrate that the proposed tests effectively detect model mis-specification, offering a principled and reliable diagnostic tool for distributional time series analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Non-Stationary Time Series Forecasting with Temporal Stabilization and Frequency Differencing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08229v6)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is critical for decision-making across dynamic domains such as energy, finance, transportation, and cloud computing. However, real-world time series often exhibit non-stationarity, including temporal distribution shifts and spectral variability, which pose significant challenges for long-term time series forecasting. In this paper, we propose DTAF, a dual-branch framework that addresses non-stationarity in both the temporal and frequency domains. For the temporal domain, the Temporal Stabilizing Fusion (TFS) module employs a non-stationary mix of experts (MOE) filter to disentangle and suppress temporal non-stationary patterns while preserving long-term dependencies. For the frequency domain, the Frequency Wave Modeling (FWM) module applies frequency differencing to dynamically highlight components with significant spectral shifts. By fusing the complementary outputs of TFS and FWM, DTAF generates robust forecasts that adapt to both temporal and frequency domain non-stationarity. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DTAF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding significant improvements in forecasting accuracy under non-stationary conditions.

Dengue forecasting often relies on site-specific covariates and entomological data, limiting generalizability in data-sparse settings. We propose a data-parsimonious (DP) framework based on the incidence versus cumulative cases (ICC) curve, extending it from a basic SIR to a two-population SEIR model for dengue. Our DP model uses only the target season's incidence time series and estimates only two parameters, reducing noise and computational burden. A Bayesian extension quantifies the case reporting and fitting uncertainty to produce calibrated predictive intervals. We evaluated the performance of the DP model in the 2022-2023 outbreaks in Florida, where standardized clinical tests and reporting support accurate case determination. The DP framework demonstrates competitive predictive performance at substantially lower computational cost than more elaborate models, making it suitable for dengue early detection where dense surveillance or long historical records are unavailable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Manifold-Aware Diffusion-Augmented Contrastive Learning for Noise-Robust Biosignal Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20048v3)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning robust representations for physiological time-series signals continues to pose a substantial challenge in developing efficient few-shot learning applications. This difficulty is largely due to the complex pathological variations in biosignals. In this context, this paper introduces a manifold-aware Diffusion-Augmented Contrastive Learning (DACL) framework, which efficiently leverages the generative structure of latent diffusion models with the discriminative power of supervised contrastive learning. The proposed framework operates within a contextualized scattering latent space derived from Scattering Transformer (ST) features. Within a contrastive learning framework, we employ a forward diffusion process in the scattering latent space as a structured manifold-aware feature augmentation technique. We assessed the proposed framework using the PhysioNet 2017 ECG benchmark dataset. The proposed method achieved a competitive AUROC of 0.9741 in the task of detecting atrial fibrillation from a single-lead ECG signal. The proposed framework achieved performance on par with relevant state-of-the-art related works. In-depth evaluation findings suggest that early-stage diffusion serves as an ideal "local manifold explorer," producing embeddings with greater precision than typical augmentation methods while preserving inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Stochastic Dynamics from Non-Sequential Data (DyNoSeD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17690v4)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inferring stochastic dynamics from data is central across the sciences, yet in many applications only unordered, non-sequential measurements are available-often restricted to limited regions of state space-so standard time-series methods do not apply. We introduce DyNoSeD, a first-principles framework that identifies unknown dynamical parameters from such non-sequential data by minimizing Fokker-Planck residuals. We develop two complementary routes: a local route that handles region-restricted data via locally estimated scores, and a global route that fits dynamics from globally sampled data using a kernel Stein discrepancy without explicit density or score estimation. When the dynamics are affine in the unknown parameters, we prove a necessary-and-sufficient condition for the existence and uniqueness of the inferred parameters and derive a sensitivity analysis that identifies which parameters are tightly constrained by the data and which remain effectively free under over-parameterization. For general non-affine case, both routes define differentiable losses amenable to gradient-based optimization. As demonstrations, we recover (i) the three parameters of a stochastic Lorenz system from non-sequential data (region-restricted data for the local route and full steady-state data for the global route) and (ii) a 3x7interaction matrix of a nonlinear gene-regulatory network derived from a published B-cell differentiation model, using only unordered steady-state samples and applying the global route. Finally, we show that the same Fokker-Planck residual viewpoint supports a "dynamics-to-density" complement that trains a normalized density estimator directly from known dynamics without any observations. Overall, IDyNSD provides two first-principles routes for system-identification from non-sequential data, grounded in the Fokker-Planck equation, that link data, density, and stochastic dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying all snarls and superbubbles in linear-time, via a unified SPQR-tree framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21919v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Snarls and superbubbles are fundamental pangenome decompositions capturing variant sites. These bubble-like structures underpin key tasks in computational pangenomics, including structural-variant genotyping, distance indexing, haplotype sampling, and variant annotation. Snarls can be quadratically-many in the size of the graph, and since their introduction in 2018 with the vg toolkit, there has been no work on identifying all snarls in linear time. Moreover, while it is known how to find superbubbles in linear time, this result is a highly specialized solution only achieved after a long series of papers. We present the first algorithm identifying all snarls in linear time. This is based on a new representation of all snarls, of size linear in the input graph size, and which can be computed in linear time. Our algorithm is based on a unified framework that also provides a new linear-time algorithm for finding superbubbles. An observation behind our results is that all such structures are separated from the rest of the graph by two vertices (except for cases which are trivially computable), i.e. their endpoints are a 2-separator of the underlying undirected graph. Based on this, we employ the well-known SPQR tree decomposition, which encodes all 2-separators, to guide a traversal that finds the bubble-like structures efficiently. We implemented our algorithms in C++ (available at https://github.com/algbio/BubbleFinder) and evaluated them on various pangenomic datasets. Our algorithms outcompete or they are on the same level of existing methods. For snarls, we are up to two times faster than vg, while identifying all snarls. When computing superbubbles, we are up to 50 times faster than BubbleGun. Our SPQR tree framework provides a unifying perspective on bubble-like structures in pangenomics, together with a template for finding other bubble-like structures efficiently.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Exogenous Signals for Hydrology Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11849v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in time series research facilitate the development of foundation models. While many state-of-the-art time series foundation models have been introduced, few studies examine their effectiveness in specific downstream applications in physical science. This work investigates the role of integrating domain knowledge into time series models for hydrological rainfall-runoff modeling. Using the CAMELS-US dataset, which includes rainfall and runoff data from 671 locations with six time series streams and 30 static features, we compare baseline and foundation models. Results demonstrate that models incorporating comprehensive known exogenous inputs outperform more limited approaches, including foundation models. Notably, incorporating natural annual periodic time series contribute the most significant improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Parameter Optimization for Robust Remote Photoplethysmography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21903v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables contactless vital sign monitoring using standard RGB cameras. However, existing methods rely on fixed parameters optimized for particular lighting conditions and camera setups, limiting adaptability to diverse deployment environments. This paper introduces the Projection-based Robust Signal Mixing (PRISM) algorithm, a training-free method that jointly optimizes photometric detrending and color mixing through online parameter adaptation based on signal quality assessment. PRISM achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods, with MAE of 0.77 bpm on PURE and 0.66 bpm on UBFC-rPPG, and accuracy of 97.3\% and 97.5\% respectively at a 5 bpm threshold. Statistical analysis confirms PRISM performs equivalently to leading supervised methods ($p > 0.2$), while maintaining real-time CPU performance without training. This validates that adaptive time series optimization significantly improves rPPG across diverse conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Times Series for Health NeurIPs Workshop 2025</p></details> |

Social media platforms like X have become major spaces where people share medication-related experiences, especially for widely marketed drugs such as semaglutide. Despite high activity online, how different user groups engage in semaglutide discussions remains unclear. Objective: This study examines how semaglutide is perceived and discussed across X user groups by analyzing (1) changes in sentiment over time and (2) key discussion topics. Methods: We collected 859,751 posts about semaglutide from July 2021 to April 2024, along with metadata. We performed sentiment analysis and topic modeling to evaluate patterns across user subpopulations and time periods. Results: The overall mean sentiment was -0.24, with all groups showing declines over time. Discussions focused on weight loss, side effects, costs, and celebrity or political influence. Organizational accounts expressed less negative sentiment (mean = -0.04) than individuals (mean = -0.28), a statistically significant difference (P < .001). An interrupted time-series analysis showed a sentiment drop between Nov 2022 and Jan 2023, coinciding with regulatory announcements. We also found gender differences: posts by female users contained more discussions of celebrities and politicians (21 percent) compared to male users (17 percent), while male users expressed more positive sentiment. Conclusions: This study highlights how diverse user groups perceive and discuss semaglutide. Although sentiment was broadly negative, important differences emerged across subpopulations. These findings have implications for health communication and pharmacovigilance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Layer Detection of Wireless Misbehavior Using 5G RAN Telemetry and Operational Metadata](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21803v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>5G Standalone deployments can exhibit uplink misbehavior from user equipment that remains fully compliant with standard control plane procedures. Manipulations such as transmit power inflation, gradual timing drift, and short off grant bursts leave the signaling state intact but distort the expected relationships among the telemetry streams produced by the gNB. This work examines whether these cross layer relationships can serve as a reliable basis for identifying such misbehavior without introducing new signaling. Using a controlled 5G Standalone testbed with commercial user equipment and a software defined radio adversarial device, we study how each manipulation affects the coherence among physical layer measurements, MAC scheduling decisions, and configuration metadata. The results show that every manipulation produces a distinct and reproducible signature that is not visible from any single telemetry source. Power offsets weaken the natural connection between SNR and CQI, timing drift breaks the alignment maintained by the scheduler, and off grant activity produces uplink energy that does not agree with allocation logs. These inconsistencies appear in merged multi layer time series traces and in cross domain views such as the SNR to CQI plane. The findings indicate that cross layer coherence provides a practical signal for detecting uplink misbehavior using only standard gNB telemetry, with no protocol modifications required, which makes the method suitable for integration into operational monitoring and auditing systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multivariate Spatio-temporal Modelling for Completing Cancer Registries and Forecasting Incidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21714v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cancer data, particularly cancer incidence and mortality, are fundamental to understand the cancer burden, to set targets for cancer control and to evaluate the evolution of the implementation of a cancer control policy. However, the complexity of data collection, classification, validation and processing result in cancer incidence figures often lagging two to three years behind the calendar year. In response, national or regional population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) are increasingly interested in methods for forecasting cancer incidence. However, in many countries there is an additional difficulty in projecting cancer incidence as regional registries are usually not established in the same year and therefore cancer incidence data series between different regions of a country are not harmonised over time. This study addresses the challenge of forecasting cancer incidence with incomplete data at both regional and national levels. To achieve this, we propose the use of multivariate spatio-temporal shared component models that jointly model mortality data and available cancer incidence data. We evaluate the performance of these multivariate models using lung cancer incidence data and the corresponding number of deaths reported in England for the period 2001-2019. Model performance was assessed using different predictive measures to select the best model.</p></details> | 37 pages |
| **[Machine Learning Approaches to Clinical Risk Prediction: Multi-Scale Temporal Alignment in Electronic Health Records](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21561v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study proposes a risk prediction method based on a Multi-Scale Temporal Alignment Network (MSTAN) to address the challenges of temporal irregularity, sampling interval differences, and multi-scale dynamic dependencies in Electronic Health Records (EHR). The method focuses on temporal feature modeling by introducing a learnable temporal alignment mechanism and a multi-scale convolutional feature extraction structure to jointly model long-term trends and short-term fluctuations in EHR sequences. At the input level, the model maps multi-source clinical features into a unified high-dimensional semantic space and employs temporal embedding and alignment modules to dynamically weight irregularly sampled data, reducing the impact of temporal distribution differences on model performance. The multi-scale feature extraction module then captures key patterns across different temporal granularities through multi-layer convolution and hierarchical fusion, achieving a fine-grained representation of patient states. Finally, an attention-based aggregation mechanism integrates global temporal dependencies to generate individual-level risk representations for disease risk prediction and health status assessment. Experiments conducted on publicly available EHR datasets show that the proposed model outperforms mainstream baselines in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of multi-scale temporal alignment in complex medical time-series analysis. This study provides a new solution for intelligent representation of high-dimensional asynchronous medical sequences and offers important technical support for EHR-driven clinical risk prediction.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

While the underlying system is often believed to behave similar at different points in space and time, those variations that do exist are twofold relevant: They often encode important information in and of themselves. And they may negatively affect the stability / convergence and reliability\Slash{}validity of results of algorithms assuming stationarity or space-translation invariance. We study the information encoded in changes of the causal graph, with stability in mind. An analysis of this general task identifies two core challenges. We develop guiding principles to overcome these challenges, and provide a framework realizing these principles by modifying constraint-based causal discovery approaches on the level of independence testing. This leads to an extremely modular, easily extensible and widely applicable framework. It can leverage existing constraint-based causal discovery methods (demonstrated on IID-algorithms PC, PC-stable, FCI and time series algorithms PCMCI, PCMCI+, LPCMCI) with little to no modification. The built-in modularity allows to systematically understand and improve upon an entire array of subproblems. By design, it can be extended by leveraging insights from change-point-detection, clustering, independence-testing and other well-studied related problems. The division into more accessible sub-problems also simplifies the understanding of fundamental limitations, hyperparameters controlling trade-offs and the statistical interpretation of results. An open-source implementation will be available soon.</p></details> |  |

Existing explainability methods often focus on input-output attributions, leaving the internal mechanisms largely opaque. This paper addresses this gap by adapting various Mechanistic Interpretability techniques; activation patching, attention saliency, and sparse autoencoders, from NLP to transformer architectures designed explicitly for time series classification. We systematically probe the internal causal roles of individual attention heads and timesteps, revealing causal structures within these models. Through experimentation on a benchmark time series dataset, we construct causal graphs illustrating how information propagates internally, highlighting key attention heads and temporal positions driving correct classifications. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential of sparse autoencoders for uncovering interpretable latent features. Our findings provide both methodological contributions to transformer interpretability and novel insights into the functional mechanics underlying transformer performance in time series classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we present a conditional score network for time-series synthesis, deriving a denoising score matching loss tailored for our purposes. In particular, our presented denoising score matching loss is the conditional denoising score matching loss for time-series synthesis. In addition, our framework is such flexible that both regular and irregular time-series can be synthesized with minimal changes to our model design. Finally, we obtain exceptional synthesis performance on various time-series datasets, achieving state-of-the-art sampling diversity and quality.</p></details> |  |

However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations-such as marginalized role in model architectures, reliance on coarse statistical text prompts, and lack of interpretability. In this work, we introduce Augur, a fully LLM driven time series forecasting framework that exploits LLM causal reasoning to discover and use directed causal associations among covariates. Augur uses a two stage teacher student architecture where a powerful teacher LLM infers a directed causal graph from time series using heuristic search together with pairwise causality testing. A lightweight student agent then refines the graph and fine tune on high confidence causal associations that are encoded as rich textual prompts to perform forecasting. This design improves predictive accuracy while yielding transparent, traceable reasoning about variable interactions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with 26 baselines demonstrate that Augur achieves competitive performance and robust zero-shot generalization.</p></details> | 24 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Assessing (im)balance in signed brain networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00542v3)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many complex systems - be they financial, natural, or social - are composed of units - such as stocks, neurons, or agents - whose joint activity can be represented as a multivariate time series. An issue of both practical and theoretical importance concerns the possibility of inferring the presence of a static relationship between any two units solely from their dynamic state. The present contribution aims at tackling such an issue within the frame of traditional hypothesis testing: briefly speaking, our suggestion is that of linking any two units if behaving in a sufficiently similar way. To achieve such a goal, we project a multivariate time series onto a signed graph by i) comparing the empirical properties of the former with those expected under a suitable benchmark and ii) linking any two units with a positive (negative) edge in case the corresponding series shares a significantly large number of concordant (discordant) values. To define our benchmarks, we adopt an information-theoretic approach that is rooted into the constrained maximisation of Shannon entropy, a procedure inducing an ensemble of multivariate time series that preserves some of the empirical properties on average, while randomising everything else. We showcase the possible applications of our method by addressing one of the most timely issues in the domain of neurosciences, i.e. that of determining if brain networks are frustrated or not, and, if so, to what extent. As our results suggest, this is indeed the case, with the major contribution to the underlying negative subgraph coming from the subcortical structures (and, to a lesser extent, from the limbic regions). At the mesoscopic level, the minimisation of the Bayesian Information Criterion, instantiated with the Signed Stochastic Block Model, reveals that brain areas gather into modules aligning with the statistical variant of the Relaxed Balance Theory.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 16 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

This enables unscripted, in the wild video analysis at scale to capture natural facial behaviors, transferrable across devices, topics, and cultures without active intervention by clinicians or researchers during recording. Most existing resources prioritize speech or scripted interviews, limiting use outside clinics and coupling predictions to language and transcription. In contrast, we identify and analyze whether temporal facial kinematics, including blink dynamics, small mouth jaw motions, gaze variability, and subtle head adjustments, are sufficient for dementia screening without speech or text. By stabilizing facial signals, we convert these micro movements into interpretable facial microdynamic time series, smooth them, and summarize short windows into compact clip level statistics for screening. Each window is encoded by its activity mix (the relative share of motion across streams), thus the predictor analyzes the distribution of motion across streams rather than its magnitude, making per channel effects transparent. We also introduce YT DemTalk, a new dataset curated from publicly available, in the wild camera facing videos. It contains 300 clips (150 with self reported dementia, 150 controls) to test our model and offer a first benchmarking of the corpus. On YT DemTalk, ablations identify gaze lability and mouth/jaw dynamics as the most informative cues, and light weighted shallow classifiers could attain a dementia prediction performance of (AUROC) 0.953, 0.961 Average Precision (AP), 0.851 F1-score, and 0.857 accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[MorphingDB: A Task-Centric AI-Native DBMS for Model Management and Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21160v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing demand for deep neural inference within database environments has driven the emergence of AI-native DBMSs. However, existing solutions either rely on model-centric designs requiring developers to manually select, configure, and maintain models, resulting in high development overhead, or adopt task-centric AutoML approaches with high computational costs and poor DBMS integration. We present MorphingDB, a task-centric AI-native DBMS that automates model storage, selection, and inference within PostgreSQL. To enable flexible, I/O-efficient storage of deep learning models, we first introduce specialized schemas and multi-dimensional tensor data types to support BLOB-based all-in-one and decoupled model storage. Then we design a transfer learning framework for model selection in two phases, which builds a transferability subspace via offline embedding of historical tasks and employs online projection through feature-aware mapping for real-time tasks. To further optimize inference throughput, we propose pre-embedding with vectoring sharing to eliminate redundant computations and DAG-based batch pipelines with cost-aware scheduling to minimize the inference time. Implemented as a PostgreSQL extension with LibTorch, MorphingDB outperforms AI-native DBMSs (EvaDB, Madlib, GaussML) and AutoML platforms (AutoGluon, AutoKeras, AutoSklearn) across nine public datasets, encompassing series, NLP, and image tasks. Our evaluation demonstrates a robust balance among accuracy, resource consumption, and time cost in model selection and significant gains in throughput and resource efficiency.</p></details> |  |

While most existing AutoML approaches focus on automating feature engineering and model architecture search, recent studies in time series forecasting suggest that lightweight models can often achieve state-of-the-art performance. This observation led us to explore improving data quality, rather than model architecture, as a potentially fruitful direction for AutoML on time series data. We propose DCATS, a Data-Centric Agent for Time Series. DCATS leverages metadata accompanying time series to clean data while optimizing forecasting performance. We evaluated DCATS using four time series forecasting models on a large-scale traffic volume forecasting dataset. Results demonstrate that DCATS achieves an average 6% error reduction across all tested models and time horizons, highlighting the potential of data-centric approaches in AutoML for time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[TiCT: A Synthetically Pre-Trained Foundation Model for Time Series Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19694v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ubiquity of time series data creates a strong demand for general-purpose foundation models, yet developing them for classification remains a significant challenge, largely due to the high cost of labeled data. Foundation models capable of in-context learning (ICL) offer a powerful solution, adapting to new tasks with minimal examples and reducing the need for extensive retraining. However, prior work on large-scale time series models has predominantly focused on forecasting, leaving a critical gap for versatile, fine-tuning-free classification. To address this, we introduce TiCT (Time-series in-Context Transformer), a transformer-based model pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data to perform in-context classification. We make two primary technical contributions: 1) a novel architecture featuring a scalable bit-based label encoding and a special output attention mechanism to handle an arbitrary number of classes; and 2) a synthetic pre-training framework that combines a Mixup-inspired process with data augmentation to foster generalization and noise invariance. Extensive evaluations on the UCR Archive show that TiCT achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art supervised methods. Crucially, this is accomplished using only in-context examples at inference time, without updating a single model weight.</p></details> |  |

Recent research has shown that long-term AD predictions by image generation often face difficulties maintaining disease-related characteristics when dealing with irregular time intervals in sequential data. Considering that the time-related aspects of the distribution can reflect changes in disease-related characteristics when images are distributed unevenly, this research proposes a model to estimate the temporal parameter within the Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution (T-NIG) to assist in generating images over the long term. The T-NIG model employs brain images from two different time points to create intermediate brain images, forecast future images, and predict the disease. T-NIG is designed by identifying features using coordinate neighborhoods. It incorporates a time parameter into the normal inverse gamma distribution to understand how features change in brain imaging sequences that have varying time intervals. Additionally, T-NIG utilizes uncertainty estimation to reduce both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in the model, which arise from insufficient temporal data. In particular, the T-NIG model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term prediction tasks within the dataset. Experimental results indicate that T-NIG is proficient in forecasting disease progression while maintaining disease-related characteristics, even when faced with an irregular temporal data distribution.</p></details> | 13pages, 6 figures |

For this purpose, farmers need to identify more resilient cows, which can cope better with farm conditions and complete more lactations. This decision-making process is inherently complex, with significant environmental and economic implications. In this study, we develop an AI-driven model to predict cow longevity using historical multivariate time-series data recorded from birth. Leveraging advanced AI techniques, specifically Multi-Head Attention Transformers, we analysed approximately 780,000 records from 19,000 unique cows across 7 farms in Australia. The results demonstrate that our model achieves an overall determination coefficient of 83% in predicting herd life across the studied farms, highlighting its potential for practical application in dairy herd management.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transfer entropy for finite data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16215v3)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transfer entropy is a widely used measure for quantifying directed information flows in complex systems. While the challenges of estimating transfer entropy for continuous data are well known, it has two major shortcomings for data of finite cardinality: it exhibits a substantial positive bias for sparse bin counts, and it has no clear means to assess statistical significance. By computing information content in finite data streams without explicitly considering symbols as instances of random variables, we derive a transfer entropy measure which is asymptotically equivalent to the standard plug-in estimator but remedies these issues for time series of small size and/or high cardinality, permitting a fully nonparametric assessment of statistical significance without simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added link to code at https://github.com/aleckirkley/Reduced-Transfer-Entropy</p></details> |

Manual measurement of this growth is time-consuming and often imprecise, as it is typically performed along 4 to 8 radial directions on a cross-sectional disc. In recent years, automated algorithms and datasets have emerged to enhance accuracy and automate the delineation of annual rings in cross-sectional images. To address the scarcity of wood cross-section data, we introduce the UruDendro4 dataset, a collection of 102 image samples of Pinus taeda L., each manually annotated with annual growth rings. Unlike existing public datasets, UruDendro4 includes samples extracted at multiple heights along the stem, allowing for the volumetric modeling of annual growth using manually delineated rings. This dataset (images and annotations) allows the development of volumetric models for annual wood estimation based on cross-sectional imagery. Additionally, we provide a performance baseline for automatic ring detection on this dataset using state-of-the-art methods. The highest performance was achieved by the DeepCS-TRD method, with a mean Average Precision of 0.838, a mean Average Recall of 0.782, and an Adapted Rand Error score of 0.084. A series of ablation experiments were conducted to empirically validate the final parameter configuration. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that training a learning model including this dataset improves the model's generalization in the tree-ring detection task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE 15th International Conference on Pattern Recognition Systems (ICPRS-25)</p></details> |
| **[TS-RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation based Time Series Foundation Models are Stronger Zero-Shot Forecaster](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07649v4)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and Foundation Models (FMs) have recently become prevalent for time series forecasting tasks. While fine-tuning LLMs enables domain adaptation, they often struggle to generalize across diverse and unseen datasets. Moreover, existing Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) still face challenges in handling non-stationary dynamics and distribution shifts, largely due to the lack of effective mechanisms for adaptation. To this end, we present TS-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework for time series forecasting that enhances the generalization and interpretability of TSFMs. Specifically, TS-RAG leverages pre-trained time series encoders to retrieve semantically relevant segments from a dedicated knowledge base, enriching the contextual representation of the input query. Furthermore, we propose an Adaptive Retrieval Mixer (ARM) module that dynamically fuses the retrieved patterns with the TSFM's internal representation, improving forecasting accuracy without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Thorough empirical studies on seven public benchmark datasets demonstrate that TS-RAG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasting performance, outperforming the existing TSFMs by up to 6.84% across diverse domains while also providing desirable interpretability.

Two time-series models were trained using bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) and transformer architectures. The dataset consisted of 3D full-body plug-in gait dynamic coordinates from 20 normal-weight healthy male individuals each performing 204 load-reaching tasks from different load positions while adapting various lifting and handling techniques. The model inputs consisted of the 3D position of the hand-load position, lifting (stoop, full-squat and semi-squat) and handling (one- and two-handed) techniques, body weight and height, and the 3D coordinate data of the body posture from the first 25% of the task duration. These inputs were used by the models to predict body coordinates during the remaining 75% of the task period. Moreover, a novel method was proposed to improve the accuracy of the previous and present posture prediction networks by enforcing constant body segment lengths through the optimization of a new cost function. The results indicated that the new cost function decreased the prediction error of the models by approximately 8% and 21% for the arm and leg models, respectively. We indicated that utilizing the transformer architecture, with a root-mean-square-error of 47.0 mm, exhibited ~58% more accurate long-term performance than the BLSTM-based model. This study merits the use of neural networks that capture time series dependencies in 3D motion frames, providing a unique approach for understanding and predict motion dynamics during manual material handling activities.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[MSTN: Fast and Efficient Multivariate Time Series Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20577v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world time-series data is highly non stationary and complex in dynamics that operate across multiple timescales, ranging from fast, short-term changes to slow, long-term trends. Most existing models rely on fixed-scale structural priors, such as patch-based tokenization, fixed frequency transformations, or frozen backbone architectures. This often leads to over-regularization of temporal dynamics, which limits their ability to adaptively model the full spectrum of temporal variations and impairs their performance on unpredictable, Sudden, high-magnitude events. To address this, we introduce the Multi-scale Temporal Network (MSTN), a novel deep learning architecture founded on a hierarchical multi-scale and sequence modeling principle. The MSTN framework integrates: (i) a multi-scale convolutional encoder that constructs a hierarchical feature pyramid for local patterns (ii) a sequence modeling component for long-range temporal dependencies. We empirically validate this with BiLSTM and Transformer variants, establishing a flexible foundation for future architectural advancements. and (iii) a gated fusion mechanism augmented with squeeze-and-excitation (SE) and multi-head temporal attention (MHTA) for dynamic, context-aware feature integration. This design enables MSTN to adaptively model temporal patterns from milliseconds to long-range dependencies within a unified framework. Extensive evaluations across time-series long-horizon forecasting, imputation, classification and generalizability study demonstrate that MSTN achieves competitive state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, showing improvements over contemporary approaches including EMTSF, LLM4TS, HiMTM, TIME-LLM, MTST, SOFTS, iTransformer, TimesNet, and PatchTST. In total, MSTN establishes new SOTA performance on 24 of 32 benchmark datasets, demonstrating its consistent performance across diverse temporal tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables</p></details> |

Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are powerful tools for modelling time-series data with underlying state structure. However, selecting appropriate parametric forms for the state-dependent distributions is often challenging and can lead to model misspecification. To address this, P-spline-based nonparametric estimation of state-dependent densities has been proposed. While offering great flexibility, these approaches can result in overly complex densities (e.g. bimodal) that hinder interpretability. 2. We propose a straightforward method that builds on shape-constrained spline theory to enforce unimodality in the estimated state-dependent densities through enforcing unimodality of the spline coefficients. This constraint strikes a practical balance between model flexibility, interpretability, and parsimony. 3. Through two simulation studies and a real-world case study using narwhal (Monodon monoceros) dive data, we demonstrate the proposed approach yields more stable estimates compared to fully flexible, unconstrained models improving model performance and interpretability. 4. Our method bridges a key methodological gap, by providing a parsimonious HMM framework that balances the interpretability of parametric models with the flexibility of nonparametric estimation. This provides ecologists with a powerful tool to derive ecologically meaningful inference from telemetry data while avoiding the pitfalls of overly complex models.</p></details> | 29 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Harnessing Vision-Language Models for Time Series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06836v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) has played a vital role in a variety of fields, including healthcare, finance, and sensor-based condition monitoring. Prior methods, which mainly focus on training domain-specific models on numerical data, lack the visual-temporal understanding capacity that human experts have to identify contextual anomalies. To fill this gap, we explore a solution based on vision language models (VLMs). Recent studies have shown the ability of VLMs for visual understanding tasks, yet their direct application to time series has fallen short on both accuracy and efficiency. To harness the power of VLMs for TSAD, we propose a two-stage solution, with (1) ViT4TS, a vision-screening stage built on a relatively lightweight pre-trained vision encoder, which leverages 2D time series representations to accurately localize candidate anomalies; (2) VLM4TS, a VLM-based stage that integrates global temporal context and VLM's visual understanding capacity to refine the detection upon the candidates provided by ViT4TS. We show that without any time-series training, VLM4TS outperforms time-series pre-trained and from-scratch baselines in most cases, yielding a 24.6% improvement in F1-max score over the best baseline. Moreover, VLM4TS also consistently outperforms existing language model-based TSAD methods and is on average 36x more efficient in token usage.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026 (Oral)</p></details> |

We present methods for estimating the locations and number of breaks using a dynamic programming algorithm and a sequential prediction-interval-based procedure, respectively, and outline strategies for specifying and estimating the full model. Empirical analysis of U.S. exports of goods to Mainland China (2006-2025) demonstrates that the STSA model accurately identifies structural breaks linked to major economic events and provides a meaningful decomposition of the underlying economic cycle dynamics. Evaluation on the monthly M4 Competition data shows that STSA significantly outperforms Prophet and, while generally less accurate than stochastic trend models such as ARIMA, ETS, TBATS, and Theta, it produces superior forecasts for series with abrupt structural breaks where stochastic approaches struggle to adapt. Unlike traditional time series models, STSA offers an interpretable decomposition that reveals the causal narrative behind the series' evolution, enhancing the credibility of out-of-sample forecasts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wavelet Canonical Coherence for Nonstationary Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14253v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the evolving dependence between two clusters of multivariate signals is fundamental in neuroscience and other domains where sub-networks in a system interact dynamically over time. Despite the growing interest in multivariate time series analysis, existing methods for between-clusters dependence typically rely on the assumption of stationarity and lack the temporal resolution to capture transient, frequency-specific interactions. To overcome this limitation, we propose scale-specific wavelet canonical coherence (WaveCanCoh), a novel framework that extends canonical coherence analysis to the nonstationary setting by leveraging the multivariate locally stationary wavelet model. The proposed WaveCanCoh enables the estimation of time-varying canonical coherence between clusters, providing interpretable insight into scale-specific time-varying interactions between clusters. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate that WaveCanCoh accurately recovers true coherence structures under both locally stationary and general nonstationary conditions. Application to local field potential (LFP) activity data recorded from the hippocampus reveals distinct dynamic coherence patterns between correct and incorrect memory-guided decisions, illustrating the capacity of the method to detect behaviorally relevant neural coordination. These results highlight WaveCanCoh as a flexible and principled tool for modeling complex cross-group dependencies in nonstationary multivariate systems.

| **[RED-F: Reconstruction-Elimination based Dual-stream Contrastive Forecasting for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20044v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proactive prediction of anomalies (AP) in multivariate time series (MTS) is a critical challenge to ensure system dependability. The difficulty lies in identifying subtle anomaly precursors concealed within normal signals. However, existing unsupervised methods, trained exclusively on normal data, demonstrate a fundamental propensity to reconstruct normal patterns. Consequently, when confronted with weak precursors, their predictions are dominated by the normal pattern, submerging the very signal required for prediction. To contend with the limitation, we propose RED-F, a Reconstruction-Elimination based Dual-stream Contrastive Forecasting framework, comprising the Reconstruction-Elimination Model (REM) and the Dual-stream Contrastive Forecasting Model (DFM). The REM utilizes a hybrid time-frequency mechanism to mitigate the precursor, generating a purified, normal-pattern baseline. The DFM then receives this purified baseline and the original sequence which retains the precursor as parallel inputs. At the core of our framework, RED-F employs a contrastive forecast that transforms the difficult task of absolute signal detection into a simpler, more robust task of relative trajectory comparison by computing the divergence between these two predictive streams. This contrastive mechanism serves to amplify the faint precursor signal. Furthermore, the DFM is trained with a novel Multi-Series Prediction (MSP) objective, which leverages distant future context to enhance its predictive sensitivity. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate the superior capability of RED-F in anomaly prediction tasks.</p></details> | 13 pages, 12 figures |

Using the HiQ dataset (U.S., 2000-2022), we systematically compare statistical baselines, a fully supervised LSTM, and the Sundial foundation model under multiple evaluation protocols. We find that Sundial, in the zero-shot setting, can outperform a fully trained LSTM provided that the input context window is sufficiently long-specifically, when covering more than one or two full seasonal cycles. This demonstrates, for the first time, that a general-purpose foundation model can surpass specialized supervised models on remote-sensing time series prediction without any task-specific tuning. These results highlight the strong potential of pretrained time-series foundation models to serve as effective plug-and-play forecasters in agricultural and environmental applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantile-Frequency Analysis and Spectral Measures for Diagnostic Checks of Time Series With Nonlinear Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02545v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nonlinear dynamic volatility has been observed in many financial time series. The recently proposed quantile periodogram offers an alternative way to examine this phenomena in the frequency domain. The quantile periodogram is constructed from trigonometric quantile regression of time series data at different frequencies and quantile levels, enabling the quantile-frequency analysis (QFA) of nonlinear serial dependence. This paper introduces some spectral measures based on the quantile periodogram for diagnostic checks of financial time series models and for model-based discriminant analysis. A simulation-based parametric bootstrapping technique is employed to compute the $p$-values of the spectral measures. The usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated by a simulation study and a motivating application using the daily log returns of the S\&P 500 index together with GARCH-type models. The results show that the QFA method is able to provide additional insights into the goodness of fit of these financial time series models that may have been missed by conventional tests. The results also show that the QFA method offers a more informative way of discriminant analysis for detecting regime changes in financial time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spline Autoregression Method for Estimation of Quantile Spectrum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17163v3)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quantile spectrum was introduced in Li (2012; 2014) as an alternative tool for spectral analysis of time series. It has the capability of providing a richer view of time series data than that offered by the ordinary spectrum especially for nonlinear dynamics such as stochastic volatility. A novel method, called spline autoregression (SAR), is proposed in this paper for estimating the quantile spectrum as a bivaraite function of frequency and quantile level, under the assumption that the quantile spectrum varies smoothly with the quantile level. The SAR method is facilitated by the quantile discrete Fourier transform (QDFT) based on trigonometric quantile regression. It is enabled by the resulting time-domain quantile series (QSER) which represents properly scaled oscillatory characteristics of the original time series around a quantile. A functional autoregressive (AR) model is fitted to the QSER on a grid of quantile levels by penalized least-squares with the AR coefficients represented as smoothing splines of the quantile level. While the ordinary AR model is widely used for conventional spectral estimation, the proposed SAR method provides an effective way of estimating the quantile spectrum as a bivariate function in comparison with the alternatives. This is confirmed by a simulation study.</p></details> |  |

However, facing the challenge of cross-domain generalization, existing studies utilize statistical prior as prompt engineering fails under the huge distribution shift among various domains. In this paper, a novel time series generalization diffusion model (TimeControl) that pioneers the Domain-Fusion paradigm, systematically integrating information from multiple time series domains into a unified generative process via diffusion models. Unlike the autoregressive models that capture the conditional probabilities of the prediction horizon to the historical sequence, we use the diffusion denoising process to model the mixed distribution of the cross-domain data and generate the prediction sequence for the target domain directly utilizing conditional sampling. The proposed TimeControl contains three pivotal designs: (1) The condition network captures the multi-scale fluctuation patterns from the observation sequence, which are utilized as context representations to guide the denoising network to generate the prediction sequence; (2) Adapter-based fine-tuning strategy, the multi-domain universal representation learned in the pretraining stage is utilized for downstream tasks in target domains; (3) A novel hybrid architecture is designed to align the observation and prediction spaces, enabling TimeControl to generate prediction sequences of arbitrary lengths with flexibility. We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream 49 benchmarks and 30 baselines, and the TimeControl outperforms existing baselines on all data domains, exhibiting superior zero-shot generalization ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have updated the abstract, introduction and related work.

While deep learning approaches have achieved significant success in this field, existing methods often adopt a "one-model one-task" architecture, limiting their generalization across different tasks. To address these limitations, we perform local energy analysis in the time-frequency domain to more precisely capture and disentangle transient and non-stationary oscillatory components. Furthermore, our representational analysis reveals that generative tasks tend to capture long-period patterns from low-frequency components, whereas discriminative tasks focus on high-frequency abrupt signals, which constitutes our core contribution. Concretely, we propose Pets, a novel "one-model many-tasks" architecture based on the General fluctuation Pattern Assisted (GPA) framework that is adaptable to versatile model structures for time series analysis. Pets integrates a Fluctuation Pattern Assisted (FPA) module and a Context-Guided Mixture of Predictors (MoP). The FPA module facilitates information fusion among diverse fluctuation patterns by capturing their dependencies and progressively modeling these patterns as latent representations at each layer. Meanwhile, the MoP module leverages these generalizable pattern representations to guide and regulate the reconstruction of distinct fluctuations hierarchically by energy proportion. Pets demonstrates strong versatility and achieves state-of-the-art performance across 60 benchmarks on various tasks, including forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and classification, while demonstrating strong generalization and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have updated the abstract, citations and related work.

This bivariate function of frequency and quantile level provides a richer view of serial dependence than that offered by the ordinary spectrum. We propose a new method for estimating the quantile-crossing spectrum as a bivariate function of frequency and quantile level. The proposed method, called spline autoregression (SAR), jointly fits an AR model to the quantile-crossing series across multiple quantiles; the AR coefficients are represented as spline functions of the quantile level and penalized for their roughness. Numerical experiments show that when the underlying spectrum is smooth in quantile level the proposed method is able to produce more accurate estimates in comparison with the alternative that ignores the smoothness.</p></details> |  |

However, the potential of using non-visual, continuous sequential, as a conditioning signal for high-fidelity image generation remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, existing methods that convert series into "pseudo-images" for temporal forecasting fail to establish semantic-level alignment. In this paper, we propose TimeArtist, a temporal-visual conversion framework that pioneers semantic-level alignment between time series fluctuations and visual concepts. It pioneers a "warmup-align" paradigm: first, a dual-autoencoder and shared quantizer are self-supervised trained on large-scale datasets to learn modality-shared representations. Then, the encoders and quantizer are frozen, and a projection is introduced to align temporal and visual samples at the representation level. TimeArtist establishes a versatile cross-modal framework, enabling high-quality, diverse image generation directly from time series, while capturing temporal fluctuation patterns to render images as styles transfer. Extensive experiments show that TimeArtist achieves satisfactory performance in image generation metrics, while also attaining superior results in zero-shot temporal tasks. Our work establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal generation, bridging the gap between temporal dynamics and visual semantics.</p></details> |  |

| **[LiteCast: A Lightweight Forecaster for Carbon Optimizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06187v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over recent decades, electricity demand has experienced sustained growth through widespread electrification of transportation and the accelerated expansion of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Grids have managed the resulting surges by scaling generation capacity, incorporating additional resources such as solar and wind, and implementing demand-response mechanisms. Altogether, these policies influence a region's carbon intensity by affecting its energy mix. To mitigate the environmental impacts of consumption, carbon-aware optimizations often rely on long-horizon, high-accuracy forecasts of the grid's carbon intensity that typically use compute intensive models with extensive historical energy mix data. In addition to limiting scalability, accuracy improvements do not necessarily translate into proportional increases in savings. Highlighting the need for more efficient forecasting strategies, we argue that carbon forecasting solutions can achieve the majority of savings without requiring highly precise and complex predictions. Instead, it is the preservation of the ranking of forecasts relative to the ground-truth that drives realized savings. In this paper, we present LiteCast, a lightweight time series forecasting method capable of quickly modeling a region's energy mix to estimate its carbon intensity. LiteCast requires only a few days of historical energy and weather data, delivering fast forecasts that can quickly adapt to sudden changes in the electrical grid. Our evaluation in 50 worldwide regions under various real-world workloads shows that LiteCast outperforms state-of-the-art forecasters, delivering 20% higher savings with near-optimal performance, achieving 97% of the maximum attainable average savings, while remaining lightweight, efficient to run, and adaptive to new data.</p></details> |  |

We propose an end-to-end offline RL framework for dual vasopressor administration in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) that directly addresses this challenge through principled action space design. Our method integrates discrete, continuous, and directional dosing strategies with conservative Q-learning and incorporates a novel recurrent modeling using a replay buffer to capture temporal dependencies in ICU time-series data. Our comparative analysis of norepinephrine dosing strategies across different action space formulations reveals that the designed action spaces improve interpretability and facilitate clinical adoption while preserving efficacy. Empirical results on eICU and MIMIC demonstrate that action space design profoundly influences learned behavioral policies. Compared with baselines, the proposed methods achieve more than 3x expected reward improvements, while aligning with established clinical protocols.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Structured Noise Modeling for Enhanced Time-Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19657v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting remains difficult in real-world settings because temporal patterns operate at multiple scales, from broad contextual trends to fast, fine-grained fluctuations that drive critical decisions. Existing neural models often struggle to represent these interacting dynamics, leading to unstable predictions and reduced reliability in downstream applications. This work introduces a forecast-blur-denoise framework that improves temporal fidelity through structured noise modeling. The approach incorporates a learnable Gaussian Process module that generates smooth, correlated perturbations, encouraging the forecasting backbone to capture long-range structure while a dedicated refinement model restores high-resolution temporal detail. Training the components jointly enables natural competence division and avoids the artifacts commonly produced by isotropic corruption methods. Experiments across electricity, traffic, and solar datasets show consistent gains in multi-horizon accuracy and stability. The modular design also allows the blur-denoise layer to operate as a lightweight enhancement for pretrained models, supporting efficient adaptation in limited-data scenarios. By strengthening the reliability and interpretability of fine-scale temporal predictions, this framework contributes to more trustworthy AI systems used in forecasting-driven decision support across energy, infrastructure, and other time-critical domains.</p></details> |  |

| **[Incorporating Ephemeral Traffic Waves in A Data-Driven Framework for Microsimulation in CARLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23236v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a data-driven traffic microsimulation framework in CARLA that reconstructs real-world wave dynamics using high-fidelity time-space data from the I-24 MOTION testbed. Calibration of road networks in microsimulators to reproduce ephemeral phenomena such as traffic waves for large-scale simulation is a process that is fraught with challenges. This work reconsiders the existence of the traffic state data as boundary conditions on an ego vehicle moving through previously recorded traffic data, rather than reproducing those traffic phenomena in a calibrated microsim. Our approach is to autogenerate a 1 mile highway segment corresponding to I-24, and use the I-24 data to power a cosimulation module that injects traffic information into the simulation. The CARLA and cosimulation simulations are centered around an ego vehicle sampled from the empirical data, with autogeneration of "visible" traffic within the longitudinal range of the ego vehicle. Boundary control beyond these visible ranges is achieved using ghost cells behind (upstream) and ahead (downstream) of the ego vehicle. Unlike prior simulation work that focuses on local car-following behavior or abstract geometries, our framework targets full time-space diagram fidelity as the validation objective. Leveraging CARLA's rich sensor suite and configurable vehicle dynamics, we simulate wave formation and dissipation in both low-congestion and high-congestion scenarios for qualitative analysis. The resulting emergent behavior closely mirrors that of real traffic, providing a novel cosimulation framework for evaluating traffic control strategies, perception-driven autonomy, and future deployment of wave mitigation solutions. Our work bridges microscopic modeling with physical experimental data, enabling the first perceptually realistic, boundary-driven simulation of empirical traffic wave phenomena in CARLA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE IV 2026</p></details> |
| **[Text2Traffic: A Text-to-Image Generation and Editing Method for Traffic Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12932v3)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of intelligent transportation systems, text-driven image generation and editing techniques have demonstrated significant potential in providing rich, controllable visual scene data for applications such as traffic monitoring and autonomous driving. However, several challenges remain, including insufficient semantic richness of generated traffic elements, limited camera viewpoints, low visual fidelity of synthesized images, and poor alignment between textual descriptions and generated content. To address these issues, we propose a unified text-driven framework for both image generation and editing, leveraging a controllable mask mechanism to seamlessly integrate the two tasks. Furthermore, we incorporate both vehicle-side and roadside multi-view data to enhance the geometric diversity of traffic scenes. Our training strategy follows a two-stage paradigm: first, we perform conceptual learning using large-scale coarse-grained text-image data; then, we fine-tune with fine-grained descriptive data to enhance text-image alignment and detail quality. Additionally, we introduce a mask-region-weighted loss that dynamically emphasizes small yet critical regions during training, thereby substantially enhancing the generation fidelity of small-scale traffic elements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves leading performance in text-based image generation and editing within traffic scenes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolutionary Discovery of Heuristic Policies for Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23122v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic Signal Control (TSC) involves a challenging trade-off: classic heuristics are efficient but oversimplified, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) achieves high performance yet suffers from poor generalization and opaque policies. Online Large Language Models (LLMs) provide general reasoning but incur high latency and lack environment-specific optimization. To address these issues, we propose Temporal Policy Evolution for Traffic (\textbf{\method{}}), which uses LLMs as an evolution engine to derive specialized heuristic policies. The framework introduces two key modules: (1) Structured State Abstraction (SSA), converting high-dimensional traffic data into temporal-logical facts for reasoning; and (2) Credit Assignment Feedback (CAF), tracing flawed micro-decisions to poor macro-outcomes for targeted critique. Operating entirely at the prompt level without training, \method{} yields lightweight, robust policies optimized for specific traffic environments, outperforming both heuristics and online LLM actors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Displacement and disconnection: the impact of violence on migration networks and highway traffic in Mexico](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12743v3)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We examine how violence affects migration flows and, crucially, how it reshapes the strength of migration networks -- measured by the intensity of migration between areas, accounting for the fact that some routes become more prominent or fade over time -- an aspect traditional studies overlook. Using a novel network algorithm and Mexican census data from 2005 to 2020, we first quantify changes in the strength of domestic and international migration networks across all Mexican municipalities. We exploit variation in local homicide rates, using exogenous fuel price increases and municipalities' proximity to oil pipelines as instruments, to estimate the causal impact of violence on migration. During our study period, following intensified government crackdowns on drug trafficking organizations, many criminal groups fragmented and turned toward large-scale oil theft, driving sharp increases in violence in areas with oil pipelines, particularly when fuel prices rose. The findings show that rising violence increased emigration flows, predominantly within Mexico, and strengthened the intensity of emigration networks both domestically and toward the United States. Although violent municipalities continued to receive new residents, the rise in emigration was larger. Increasing homicide rates led to at least an additional 1.12 million people emigrating domestically and 50,200 fewer Mexicans returning from the United States. Violence also eroded regional connectivity, causing a long-term decline in daily vehicle traffic on highways linking violent areas to the rest of the country.</p></details> |  |
| **[CNN-Based Framework for Pedestrian Age and Gender Classification Using Far-View Surveillance in Mixed-Traffic Intersections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22873v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian safety remains a pressing concern in congested urban intersections, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where traffic is multimodal, and infrastructure often lacks formal control. Demographic factors like age and gender significantly influence pedestrian vulnerability, yet real-time monitoring systems rarely capture this information. To address this gap, this study proposes a deep learning framework that classifies pedestrian age group and gender from far-view intersection footage using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), without relying on facial recognition or high-resolution imagery. The classification is structured as a unified six-class problem, distinguishing adult, teenager, and child pedestrians for both males and females, based on full-body visual cues. Video data was collected from three high-risk intersections in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Two CNN architectures were implemented: ResNet50, a deep convolutional neural network pretrained on ImageNet, and a custom lightweight CNN optimized for computational efficiency. Eight model variants explored combinations of pooling strategies and optimizers. ResNet50 with Max Pooling and SGD achieved the highest accuracy (86.19%), while the custom CNN performed comparably (84.15%) with fewer parameters and faster training. The model's efficient design enables real-time inference on standard surveillance feeds. For practitioners, this system provides a scalable, cost-effective tool to monitor pedestrian demographics at intersections using existing camera infrastructure. Its outputs can shape intersection design, optimize signal timing, and enable targeted safety interventions for vulnerable groups such as children or the elderly. By offering demographic insights often missing in conventional traffic data, the framework supports more inclusive, data-driven planning in mixed-traffic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for poster presentation at the 105th Annual Meeting of the Transportation Research Board</p></details> |
| **[Weaver: Kronecker Product Approximations of Spatiotemporal Attention for Traffic Network Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08888v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal forecasting on transportation networks is a complex task that requires understanding how traffic nodes interact within a dynamic, evolving system dictated by traffic flow dynamics and social behavioral patterns. The importance of transportation networks and ITS for modern mobility and commerce necessitates forecasting models that are not only accurate but also interpretable, efficient, and robust under structural or temporal perturbations. Recent approaches, particularly Transformer-based architectures, have improved predictive performance but often at the cost of high computational overhead and diminished architectural interpretability. In this work, we introduce Weaver, a novel attention-based model that applies Kronecker product approximations (KPA) to decompose the PN X PN spatiotemporal attention of O(P^2N^2) complexity into local P X P temporal and N X N spatial attention maps. This Kronecker attention map enables our Parallel-Kronecker Matrix-Vector product (P2-KMV) for efficient spatiotemporal message passing with O(P^2N + N^2P) complexity. To capture real-world traffic dynamics, we address the importance of negative edges in modeling traffic behavior by introducing Valence Attention using the continuous Tanimoto coefficient (CTC), which provides properties conducive to precise latent graph generation and training stability. To fully utilize the model's learning capacity, we introduce the Traffic Phase Dictionary for self-conditioning. Evaluations on PEMS-BAY and METR-LA show that Weaver achieves competitive performance across model categories while training more efficiently.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smart Traffic Signals: Comparing MARL and Fixed-Time Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14544v4)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban traffic congestion, particularly at intersections, significantly affects travel time, fuel consumption, and emissions. Traditional fixed-time signal control systems often lack the adaptability to effectively manage dynamic traffic patterns. This study explores the application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to optimize traffic signal coordination across multiple intersections within a simulated environment. A simulation was developed to model a network of interconnected intersections with randomly generated vehicle flows to reflect realistic traffic variability. A decentralized MARL controller was implemented in which each traffic signal operates as an autonomous agent, making decisions based on local observations and information from neighboring agents. Performance was evaluated against a baseline fixed-time controller using metrics such as average vehicle wait time and overall throughput. The MARL approach demonstrated statistically significant improvements, including reduced average waiting times and improved throughput. These findings suggest that MARL-based dynamic control strategies hold substantial promise to improve urban traffic management efficiency. More research is recommended to address the challenges of scalability and real-world implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine Unlearning of Traffic State Estimation and Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17984v3)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven traffic state estimation and prediction (TSEP) relies heavily on data sources that contain sensitive information. While the abundance of data has fueled significant breakthroughs, particularly in machine learning-based methods, it also raises concerns regarding privacy, cybersecurity, and data freshness. These issues can erode public trust in intelligent transportation systems. Recently, regulations have introduced the "right to be forgotten", allowing users to request the removal of their private data from models. As machine learning models can remember old data, simply removing it from back-end databases is insufficient in such systems. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel learning paradigm for TSEP-Machine Unlearning TSEP-which enables a trained TSEP model to selectively forget privacy-sensitive, poisoned, or outdated data. By empowering models to "unlearn," we aim to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of data-driven traffic TSEP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid SIFT-SNN for Efficient Anomaly Detection of Traffic Flow-Control Infrastructure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21337v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the SIFT-SNN framework, a low-latency neuromorphic signal-processing pipeline for real-time detection of structural anomalies in transport infrastructure. The proposed approach integrates Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for spatial feature encoding with a latency-driven spike conversion layer and a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for classification. The Auckland Harbour Bridge dataset is recorded under various weather and lighting conditions, comprising 6,000 labelled frames that include both real and synthetically augmented unsafe cases. The presented system achieves a classification accuracy of 92.3% (+- 0.8%) with a per-frame inference time of 9.5 ms. Achieved sub-10 millisecond latency, combined with sparse spike activity (8.1%), enables real-time, low-power edge deployment. Unlike conventional CNN-based approaches, the hybrid SIFT-SNN pipeline explicitly preserves spatial feature grounding, enhances interpretability, supports transparent decision-making, and operates efficiently on embedded hardware. Although synthetic augmentation improved robustness, generalisation to unseen field conditions remains to be validated. The SIFT-SNN framework is validated through a working prototype deployed on a consumer-grade system and framed as a generalisable case study in structural safety monitoring for movable concrete barriers, which, as a traffic flow-control infrastructure, is deployed in over 20 cities worldwide.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

| **[TrafficLens: Multi-Camera Traffic Video Analysis Using LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20965v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic cameras are essential in urban areas, playing a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. Multiple cameras at intersections enhance law enforcement capabilities, traffic management, and pedestrian safety. However, efficiently managing and analyzing multi-camera feeds poses challenges due to the vast amount of data. Analyzing such huge video data requires advanced analytical tools. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, excel in text-based tasks, integrating them into traffic video analysis demands converting video data into text using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), which is time-consuming and delays the timely utilization of traffic videos for generating insights and investigating incidents. To address these challenges, we propose TrafficLens, a tailored algorithm for multi-camera traffic intersections. TrafficLens employs a sequential approach, utilizing overlapping coverage areas of cameras. It iteratively applies VLMs with varying token limits, using previous outputs as prompts for subsequent cameras, enabling rapid generation of detailed textual descriptions while reducing processing time. Additionally, TrafficLens intelligently bypasses redundant VLM invocations through an object-level similarity detector. Experimental results with real-world datasets demonstrate that TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to $4\times$ while maintaining information accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 IEEE 27th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)</p></details> |

In this paper, we explore the computer vision approach for TSC that modulates on-road traffic flows through visual observation. Unlike traditional feature-based approaches, vision-based methods depend much less on heuristics and predefined features, bringing promising potentials for end-to-end learning and optimization of traffic signals. Thus, we introduce a simple traffic simulation framework called TrafficDojo towards vision-based TSC and its benchmark by integrating the microscopic traffic flow provided in SUMO into the 3D driving simulator MetaDrive. This proposed framework offers a versatile traffic environment for in-depth analysis and comprehensive evaluation of traffic signal controllers across diverse traffic conditions and scenarios. We establish and compare baseline algorithms including both traditional and Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches. This work sheds light on the design and development of vision-based TSC approaches and opens up new research opportunities</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the Transportation Research Board (TRB) 105th Annual Meeting</p></details> |
| **[Quantifying the Privacy Implications of High-Fidelity Synthetic Network Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20497v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the scarcity and privacy concerns of network traffic data, various generative models have been developed to produce synthetic traffic. However, synthetic traffic is not inherently privacy-preserving, and the extent to which it leaks sensitive information, and how to measure such leakage, remain largely unexplored. This challenge is further compounded by the diversity of model architectures, which shape how traffic is represented and synthesized. We introduce a comprehensive set of privacy metrics for synthetic network traffic, combining standard approaches like membership inference attacks (MIA) and data extraction attacks with network-specific identifiers and attributes. Using these metrics, we systematically evaluate the vulnerability of different representative generative models and examine the factors that influence attack success. Our results reveal substantial variability in privacy risks across models and datasets. MIA success ranges from 0% to 88%, and up to 100% of network identifiers can be recovered from generated traffic, highlighting serious privacy vulnerabilities. We further identify key factors that significantly affect attack outcomes, including training data diversity and how well the generative model fits the training data. These findings provide actionable guidance for designing and deploying generative models that minimize privacy leakage, establishing a foundation for safer synthetic network traffic generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 13 Figures, 6 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Denoising Refinement Diffusion Models for Simultaneous Generation of Multi-scale Mobile Network Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17532v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The planning, management, and resource scheduling of cellular mobile networks require joint estimation of mobile traffic across different layers and nodes. Mobile traffic generation can proactively anticipate user demands and capture the dynamics of network load. However, existing methods mainly focus on generating traffic at a single spatiotemporal resolution, making it difficult to jointly model multi-scale traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose ZoomDiff, a diffusion-based model for multi-scale mobile traffic generation. ZoomDiff maps urban environmental context into mobile traffic with multiple spatial and temporal resolutions through a set of customized Denoising Refinement Diffusion Models (DRDM). DRDM employs a multi-stage noise-adding and denoising mechanism, enabling different stages to generate traffic at distinct spatiotemporal resolutions. This design aligns the progressive denoising process with hierarchical network layers, including base stations, cells, and grids of varying granularities. Experiments on real-world mobile traffic datasets show that ZoomDiff achieves at least an 18.4% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines in multi-scale traffic generation tasks. Moreover, ZoomDiff demonstrates strong efficiency and cross-city generalization, highlighting its potential as a powerful generative framework for modeling multi-scale mobile network dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks often simplify pedestrian interactions, failing to capture complex, dynamic intentions and varied responses critical for robust system deployment. To overcome this, we introduce HABIT (Human Action Benchmark for Interactive Traffic), a high-fidelity simulation benchmark. HABIT integrates real-world human motion, sourced from mocap and videos, into CARLA (Car Learning to Act, a full autonomous driving simulator) via a modular, extensible, and physically consistent motion retargeting pipeline. From an initial pool of approximately 30,000 retargeted motions, we curate 4,730 traffic-compatible pedestrian motions, standardized in SMPL format for physically consistent trajectories. HABIT seamlessly integrates with CARLA's Leaderboard, enabling automated scenario generation and rigorous agent evaluation. Our safety metrics, including Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) and False Positive Braking Rate (FPBR), reveal critical failure modes in state-of-the-art AD agents missed by prior evaluations. Evaluating three state-of-the-art autonomous driving agents, InterFuser, TransFuser, and BEVDriver, demonstrates how HABIT exposes planner weaknesses that remain hidden in scripted simulations. Despite achieving close or equal to zero collisions per kilometer on the CARLA Leaderboard, the autonomous agents perform notably worse on HABIT, with up to 7.43 collisions/km and a 12.94% AIS 3+ injury risk, and they brake unnecessarily in up to 33% of cases. All components are publicly released to support reproducible, pedestrian-aware AI research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026.

However, existing diffusion and autoregressive approaches are limited by iterative sampling, sequential decoding, or task-specific designs, which hinder efficiency and reuse. We propose Masked Denoising Generation (MDG), a unified generative framework that reformulates multi-agent behavior modeling as the reconstruction of independently noised spatiotemporal tensors. Instead of relying on diffusion time steps or discrete tokenization, MDG applies continuous, per-agent and per-timestep noise masks that enable localized denoising and controllable trajectory generation in a single or few forward passes. This mask-driven formulation generalizes across open-loop prediction, closed-loop simulation, motion planning, and conditional generation within one model. Trained on large-scale real-world driving datasets, MDG achieves competitive closed-loop performance on the Waymo Sim Agents and nuPlan Planning benchmarks, while providing efficient, consistent, and controllable open-loop multi-agent trajectory generation. These results position MDG as a simple yet versatile paradigm for multi-agent behavior modeling.</p></details> |  |

Yet, recognizing traffic signs at night remains challenging due to visual noise and scarcity of public nighttime datasets. Despite advances in vision architectures, existing methods struggle with robustness under low illumination and fail to leverage complementary mutlimodal cues effectively. To overcome these limitations, firstly, we introduce INTSD, a large-scale dataset comprising street-level night-time images of traffic signboards collected across diverse regions of India. The dataset spans 41 traffic signboard classes captured under varying lighting and weather conditions, providing a comprehensive benchmark for both detection and classification tasks. To benchmark INTSD for night-time sign recognition, we conduct extensive evaluations using state-of-the-art detection and classification models. Secondly, we propose LENS-Net, which integrates an adaptive image enhancement detector for joint illumination correction and sign localization, followed by a structured multimodal CLIP-GCNN classifier that leverages cross-modal attention and graph-based reasoning for robust and semantically consistent recognition. Our method surpasses existing frameworks, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of its key components. The dataset and code for LENS-Net is publicly available for research.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately estimating flow frequencies is challenging due to the large number of flows and increasing network speeds. Hardware accelerators are often used in this endeavor due to their high computational power, but their limited amount of on-chip memory constrains their performance. Various sketch-based algorithms have been proposed to estimate properties of traffic such as frequency, with lower memory usage and theoretical bounds, but they often under perform with the skewed distribution of network traffic. In this work, we propose an algorithm for top-K identification using a modified TowerSketch and a priority queue array. Tested on real traffic traces, we identify the top-K flows, with K up to 32,768, with a precision of more than 0.94, and estimate their frequency with an average relative error under 1.96%. We designed and implemented an accelerator for this algorithm on an AMD VirtexU280 UltraScale+ FPGA, which processes one packet per cycle at392 MHz, reaching a minimum line rate of more than 200 Gbps.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, to be published in 2025 28th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)</p></details> |

Existing coordination methods enable agents to reach consensus without a centralized coordinator, but do not provide formal guarantees on system-level objectives such as efficiency or fairness. To address this limitation, we propose an iterative negotiation and oversight framework that augments a decentralized negotiation mechanism with taxation-like oversight. The framework builds upon the trading auction for consensus, enabling noncooperative agents with conflicting preferences to negotiate through asset trading while preserving valuation privacy. We introduce an oversight mechanism, which implements a taxation-like intervention that guides decentralized negotiation toward system-efficient and equitable outcomes while also regulating how fast the framework converges. We establish theoretical guarantees of finite-time termination and derive bounds linking system efficiency and convergence rate to the level of central intervention. A case study based on the collaborative trajectory options program, a rerouting initiative in U.S. air traffic management, demonstrates that the framework can reliably achieve consensus among noncooperative airspace sector managers, and reveals how the level of intervention regulates the relationship between system efficiency and convergence speed. Taken together, the theoretical and experimental results indicate that the proposed framework provides a general mechanism for decentralized coordination in noncooperative multi-agent systems while safeguarding system-level objectives.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches typically rely on either lane-changing or inter-vehicle gap creation strategies based solely on local or neighboring information, often leading to suboptimal performance in terms of safety and traffic efficiency. In this paper, we present a V2X (vehicle-to-everything communication)-assisted Multiagent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework for on-ramp merging that effectively coordinates the complex interplay between lane-changing and inter-vehicle gap adaptation strategies by utilizing zone-specific global information available from a roadside unit (RSU). The merging control problem is formulated as a Multiagent Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (MA-POMDP), where agents leverage both local and global observations through V2X communication. To support both discrete and continuous control decisions, we design a hybrid action space and adopt a parameterized deep Q-learning approach. Extensive simulations, integrating the SUMO traffic simulator and the MOSAIC V2X simulator, demonstrate that our framework significantly improves merging success rate, traffic efficiency, and road safety across diverse traffic scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing LLM-based Autonomous Driving with Modular Traffic Light and Sign Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14391v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making and planning in autonomous driving, showing promising reasoning capabilities and potential to generalize across diverse traffic situations. However, current LLM-based driving agents lack explicit mechanisms to enforce traffic rules and often struggle to reliably detect small, safety-critical objects such as traffic lights and signs. To address this limitation, we introduce TLS-Assist, a modular redundancy layer that augments LLM-based autonomous driving agents with explicit traffic light and sign recognition. TLS-Assist converts detections into structured natural language messages that are injected into the LLM input, enforcing explicit attention to safety-critical cues. The framework is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and supports both single-view and multi-view camera setups. We evaluate TLS-Assist in a closed-loop setup on the LangAuto benchmark in CARLA. The results demonstrate relative driving performance improvements of up to 14% over LMDrive and 7% over BEVDriver, while consistently reducing traffic light and sign infractions.

| **[Unified Low-Light Traffic Image Enhancement via Multi-Stage Illumination Recovery and Adaptive Noise Suppression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17612v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing low-light traffic images is crucial for reliable perception in autonomous driving, intelligent transportation, and urban surveillance systems. Nighttime and dimly lit traffic scenes often suffer from poor visibility due to low illumination, noise, motion blur, non-uniform lighting, and glare from vehicle headlights or street lamps, which hinder tasks such as object detection and scene understanding. To address these challenges, we propose a fully unsupervised multi-stage deep learning framework for low-light traffic image enhancement. The model decomposes images into illumination and reflectance components, progressively refined by three specialized modules: (1) Illumination Adaptation, for global and local brightness correction; (2) Reflectance Restoration, for noise suppression and structural detail recovery using spatial-channel attention; and (3) Over-Exposure Compensation, for reconstructing saturated regions and balancing scene luminance. The network is trained using self-supervised reconstruction, reflectance smoothness, perceptual consistency, and domain-aware regularization losses, eliminating the need for paired ground-truth images. Experiments on general and traffic-specific datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, NIQE) and qualitative visual quality. Our approach enhances visibility, preserves structure, and improves downstream perception reliability in real-world low-light traffic scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Master's thesis, Korea University, 2025</p></details> |

Traditional centralized machine learning struggles with the distributed data and privacy concerns in these heterogeneous environments, while existing federated learning approaches suffer from high costs and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose HFL-FlowLLM, which to our knowledge is the first framework to apply large language models to network traffic flow classification in heterogeneous federated learning. Compared to state-of-the-art heterogeneous federated learning methods for network traffic flow classification, the proposed approach improves the average F1 score by approximately 13%, demonstrating compelling performance and strong robustness. When compared to existing large language models federated learning frameworks, as the number of clients participating in each training round increases, the proposed method achieves up to a 5% improvement in average F1 score while reducing the training costs by about 87%. These findings prove the potential and practical value of HFL-FlowLLM in modern communication networks security.</p></details> |  |
| **[MalRAG: A Retrieval-Augmented LLM Framework for Open-set Malicious Traffic Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14129v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained identification of IDS-flagged suspicious traffic is crucial in cybersecurity. In practice, cyber threats evolve continuously, making the discovery of novel malicious traffic a critical necessity as well as the identification of known classes. Recent studies have advanced this goal with deep models, but they often rely on task-specific architectures that limit transferability and require per-dataset tuning. In this paper we introduce MalRAG, the first LLM driven retrieval-augmented framework for open-set malicious traffic identification. MalRAG freezes the LLM and operates via comprehensive traffic knowledge construction, adaptive retrieval, and prompt engineering. Concretely, we construct a multi-view traffic database by mining prior malicious traffic from content, structural, and temporal perspectives. Furthermore, we introduce a Coverage-Enhanced Retrieval Algorithm that queries across these views to assemble the most probable candidates, thereby improving the inclusion of correct evidence. We then employ Traffic-Aware Adaptive Pruning to select a variable subset of these candidates based on traffic-aware similarity scores, suppressing incorrect matches and yielding reliable retrieved evidence. Moreover, we develop a suite of guidance prompts where task instruction, evidence referencing, and decision guidance are integrated with the retrieved evidence to improve LLM performance. Across diverse real-world datasets and settings, MalRAG delivers state-of-the-art results in both fine-grained identification of known classes and novel malicious traffic discovery. Ablation and deep-dive analyses further show that MalRAG effective leverages LLM capabilities yet achieves open-set malicious traffic identification without relying on a specific LLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 13 figures.

| **[PAST: A Primary-Auxiliary Spatio-Temporal Network for Traffic Time Series Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13414v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic time series imputation is crucial for the safety and reliability of intelligent transportation systems, while diverse types of missing data, including random, fiber, and block missing make the imputation task challenging. Existing models often focus on disentangling and separately modeling spatial and temporal patterns based on relationships between data points. However, these approaches struggle to adapt to the random missing positions, and fail to learn long-term and large-scale dependencies, which are essential in extensive missing conditions. In this paper, patterns are categorized into two types to handle various missing data conditions: primary patterns, which originate from internal relationships between data points, and auxiliary patterns, influenced by external factors like timestamps and node attributes. Accordingly, we propose the Primary-Auxiliary Spatio-Temporal network (PAST). It comprises a graph-integrated module (GIM) and a cross-gated module (CGM). GIM captures primary patterns via dynamic graphs with interval-aware dropout and multi-order convolutions, and CGM extracts auxiliary patterns through bidirectional gating on embedded external features. The two modules interact via shared hidden vectors and are trained under an ensemble self-supervised framework. Experiments on three datasets under 27 missing data conditions demonstrate that the imputation accuracy of PAST outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines by up to 26.2% in RMSE and 31.6% in MAE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Descriptor: Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question Answering (DTPQA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13397v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable progress of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on a variety of tasks has raised interest in their application to automated driving. However, for these models to be trusted in such a safety-critical domain, they must first possess robust perception capabilities, i.e., they must be capable of understanding a traffic scene, which can often be highly complex, with many things happening simultaneously. Moreover, since critical objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at long distances, we require systems with not only strong perception capabilities at close distances (up to 20 meters), but also at long (30+ meters) range. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the perception capabilities of these models in isolation from other skills like reasoning or advanced world knowledge. Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question Answering (DTPQA) is a Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark designed specifically for this purpose: it can be used to evaluate the perception systems of VLMs in traffic scenarios using trivial yet crucial questions relevant to driving decisions. It consists of two parts: a synthetic benchmark (DTP-Synthetic) created using a simulator, and a real-world benchmark (DTP-Real) built on top of existing images of real traffic scenes. Additionally, DTPQA includes distance annotations, i.e., how far the object in question is from the camera. More specifically, each DTPQA sample consists of (at least): (a) an image, (b) a question, (c) the ground truth answer, and (d) the distance of the object in question, enabling analysis of how VLM performance degrades with increasing object distance. In this article, we provide the dataset itself along with the Python scripts used to create it, which can be used to generate additional data of the same kind.</p></details> |  |
| **[T2I-Based Physical-World Appearance Attack against Traffic Sign Recognition Systems in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12956v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) systems play a critical role in Autonomous Driving (AD) systems, enabling real-time detection of road signs, such as STOP and speed limit signs. While these systems are increasingly integrated into commercial vehicles, recent research has exposed their vulnerability to physical-world adversarial appearance attacks. In such attacks, carefully crafted visual patterns are misinterpreted by TSR models as legitimate traffic signs, while remaining inconspicuous or benign to human observers. However, existing adversarial appearance attacks suffer from notable limitations. Pixel-level perturbation-based methods often lack stealthiness and tend to overfit to specific surrogate models, resulting in poor transferability to real-world TSR systems. On the other hand, text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model-based approaches demonstrate limited effectiveness and poor generalization to out-of-distribution sign types. In this paper, we present DiffSign, a novel T2I-based appearance attack framework designed to generate physically robust, highly effective, transferable, practical, and stealthy appearance attacks against TSR systems. To overcome the limitations of prior approaches, we propose a carefully designed attack pipeline that integrates CLIP-based loss and masked prompts to improve attack focus and controllability. We also propose two novel style customization methods to guide visual appearance and improve out-of-domain traffic sign attack generalization and attack stealthiness. We conduct extensive evaluations of DiffSign under varied real-world conditions, including different distances, angles, light conditions, and sign categories. Our method achieves an average physical-world attack success rate of 83.3%, leveraging DiffSign's high effectiveness in attack transferability.</p></details> | 16 pages, 12 figures |

Most existing methods for traffic signal modeling often rely on the original data modality, i.e., numerical direct readings from the sensors in cities. However, this unimodal approach overlooks the semantic information existing in multimodal heterogeneous urban data in different perspectives, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of traffic signals and limits the accurate prediction of complex traffic dynamics. To address this problem, we propose a novel Multimodal framework, MTP, for urban Traffic Profiling, which learns multimodal features through numeric, visual, and textual perspectives. The three branches drive for a multimodal perspective of urban traffic signal learning in the frequency domain, while the frequency learning strategies delicately refine the information for extraction. Specifically, we first conduct the visual augmentation for the traffic signals, which transforms the original modality into frequency images and periodicity images for visual learning. Also, we augment descriptive texts for the traffic signals based on the specific topic, background information and item description for textual learning. To complement the numeric information, we utilize frequency multilayer perceptrons for learning on the original modality. We design a hierarchical contrastive learning on the three branches to fuse the spectrum of three modalities. Finally, extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

We present CareNet, a router-centric system that transforms household network metadata into interpretable behavioral indicators aligned with DSM-5 depressive-symptom domains. All processing occurs locally at the home gateway, preserving privacy while maintaining visibility of temporal routines. The core contribution is the Fuzzy Additive Symptom Likelihood (FASL), a transparent formulation that fuses header-level metrics into daily criterion-level likelihoods using bounded fuzzy memberships and additive aggregation. Combined with a DSM-style temporal gate, FASL integrates short-term traffic fluctuations into persistent, clinically interpretable indicators. Evaluation on realistic multi-day traces shows that CareNet captures characteristic patterns such as delayed sleep timing and attentional instability without payload inspection. The results highlight the feasibility of reproducible, explainable behavioral inference from router-side telemetry.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantifying Distribution Shift in Traffic Signal Control with Histogram-Based GEH Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13785v1)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signal control algorithms are vulnerable to distribution shift, where performance degrades under traffic conditions that differ from those seen during design or training. This paper introduces a principled approach to quantify distribution shift by representing traffic scenarios as demand histograms and comparing them with a GEH-based distance function. The method is policy-independent, interpretable, and leverages a widely used traffic engineering statistic. We validate the approach on 20 simulated scenarios using both a NEMA actuated controller and a reinforcement learning controller (FRAP++). Results show that larger scenario distances consistently correspond to increased travel time and reduced throughput, with particularly strong explanatory power for learning-based control. Overall, this method can predict performance degradation under distribution shift better than previously published techniques. These findings highlight the utility of the proposed framework for benchmarking, training regime design, and monitoring in adaptive traffic signal control.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyperD: Hybrid Periodicity Decoupling Framework for Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09275v2)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate traffic forecasting plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion control, route planning, and urban mobility optimization. However, traffic forecasting remains challenging due to two key factors: (1) complex spatial dependencies arising from dynamic interactions between road segments and traffic sensors across the network, and (2) the coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns (e.g., daily and weekly periodic patterns driven by human routines) with irregular fluctuations caused by unpredictable events (e.g., accidents, weather, or construction). To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ground Plane Projection for Improved Traffic Analytics at Intersections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12342v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate turning movement counts at intersections are important for signal control, traffic management and urban planning. Computer vision systems for automatic turning movement counts typically rely on visual analysis in the image plane of an infrastructure camera. Here we explore potential advantages of back-projecting vehicles detected in one or more infrastructure cameras to the ground plane for analysis in real-world 3D coordinates. For single-camera systems we find that back-projection yields more accurate trajectory classification and turning movement counts. We further show that even higher accuracy can be achieved through weak fusion of back-projected detections from multiple cameras. These results suggeest that traffic should be analyzed on the ground plane, not the image plane</p></details> |  |
| **[CATS-V2V: A Real-World Vehicle-to-Vehicle Cooperative Perception Dataset with Complex Adverse Traffic Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11168v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) cooperative perception has great potential to enhance autonomous driving performance by overcoming perception limitations in complex adverse traffic scenarios (CATS). Meanwhile, data serves as the fundamental infrastructure for modern autonomous driving AI. However, due to stringent data collection requirements, existing datasets focus primarily on ordinary traffic scenarios, constraining the benefits of cooperative perception. To address this challenge, we introduce CATS-V2V, the first-of-its-kind real-world dataset for V2V cooperative perception under complex adverse traffic scenarios. The dataset was collected by two hardware time-synchronized vehicles, covering 10 weather and lighting conditions across 10 diverse locations. The 100-clip dataset includes 60K frames of 10 Hz LiDAR point clouds and 1.26M multi-view 30 Hz camera images, along with 750K anonymized yet high-precision RTK-fixed GNSS and IMU records. Correspondingly, we provide time-consistent 3D bounding box annotations for objects, as well as static scenes to construct a 4D BEV representation. On this basis, we propose a target-based temporal alignment method, ensuring that all objects are precisely aligned across all sensor modalities. We hope that CATS-V2V, the largest-scale, most supportive, and highest-quality dataset of its kind to date, will benefit the autonomous driving community in related tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strada-LLM: Graph LLM for traffic prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20856v3)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting is pivotal for intelligent transportation systems, where accurate and interpretable predictions can significantly enhance operational efficiency and safety. A key challenge stems from the heterogeneity of traffic conditions across diverse locations, leading to highly varied traffic data distributions. Large language models (LLMs) show exceptional promise for few-shot learning in such dynamic and data-sparse scenarios. However, existing LLM-based solutions often rely on prompt-tuning, which can struggle to fully capture complex graph relationships and spatiotemporal dependencies-thereby limiting adaptability and interpretability in real-world traffic networks. We address these gaps by introducing Strada-LLM, a novel multivariate probabilistic forecasting LLM that explicitly models both temporal and spatial traffic patterns. By incorporating proximal traffic information as covariates, Strada-LLM more effectively captures local variations and outperforms prompt-based existing LLMs. To further enhance adaptability, we propose a lightweight distribution-derived strategy for domain adaptation, enabling parameter-efficient model updates when encountering new data distributions or altered network topologies-even under few-shot constraints. Empirical evaluations on spatio-temporal transportation datasets demonstrate that Strada-LLM consistently surpasses state-of-the-art LLM-driven and traditional GNN-based predictors. Specifically, it improves long-term forecasting by 17% in RMSE error and 16% more efficiency. Moreover, it maintains robust performance across different LLM backbones with minimal degradation, making it a versatile and powerful solution for real-world traffic prediction tasks.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Advanced Tool for Traffic Crash Analysis: An AI-Driven Multi-Agent Approach to Pre-Crash Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10853v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic collision reconstruction traditionally relies on human expertise, often yielding inconsistent results when analyzing incomplete multimodal data. This study develops a multi-agent AI framework that reconstructs pre-crash scenarios and infers vehicle behaviors from fragmented collision data. We present a two-phase collaborative framework combining reconstruction and reasoning phases. The system processes 277 rear-end lead vehicle deceleration (LVD) collisions from the Crash Investigation Sampling System, integrating textual crash reports, structured tabular data, and visual scene diagrams. Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset. The system maintained robust performance even when processing incomplete data, including missing or erroneous EDR records and ambiguous scene diagrams. This study demonstrates superior AI capabilities in processing heterogeneous collision data, providing unprecedented precision in reconstructing impact dynamics and characterizing pre-crash behaviors.</p></details> | 26 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Unlocking Dynamic Inter-Client Spatial Dependencies: A Federated Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning Method for Traffic Flow Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10434v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal graphs are powerful tools for modeling complex dependencies in traffic time series. However, the distributed nature of real-world traffic data across multiple stakeholders poses significant challenges in modeling and reconstructing inter-client spatial dependencies while adhering to data locality constraints. Existing methods primarily address static dependencies, overlooking their dynamic nature and resulting in suboptimal performance. In response, we propose Federated Spatio-Temporal Graph with Dynamic Inter-Client Dependencies (FedSTGD), a framework designed to model and reconstruct dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies in federated learning. FedSTGD incorporates a federated nonlinear computation decomposition module to approximate complex graph operations. This is complemented by a graph node embedding augmentation module, which alleviates performance degradation arising from the decomposition. These modules are coordinated through a client-server collective learning protocol, which decomposes dynamic inter-client spatial dependency learning tasks into lightweight, parallelizable subtasks. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedSTGD achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, approaching that of centralized baselines. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each module in addressing dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies, while sensitivity analysis highlights the robustness of FedSTGD to variations in hyperparameters.</p></details> |  |

While existing attack vectors demonstrate security concerns, they suffer from visual detectability or implementation constraints, suggesting unexplored vulnerability surfaces in TSR systems. We introduce the Adversarial Retroreflective Patch (ARP), a novel attack vector that combines the high deployability of patch attacks with the stealthiness of laser projections by utilizing retroreflective materials activated only under victim headlight illumination. We develop a retroreflection simulation method and employ black-box optimization to maximize attack effectiveness. ARP achieves $\geq$93.4\% success rate in dynamic scenarios at 35 meters and $\geq$60\% success rate against commercial TSR systems in real-world conditions. Our user study demonstrates that ARP attacks maintain near-identical stealthiness to benign signs while achieving $\geq$1.9\% higher stealthiness scores than previous patch attacks. We propose the DPR Shield defense, employing strategically placed polarized filters, which achieves $\geq$75\% defense success rates for stop signs and speed limit signs against micro-prism patches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leader-Follower Identification Methodology for Non-Lane Disciplined Heterogeneous Traffic Using Steady State Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09946v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Road traffic in developing countries, such as India, features a heterogeneous mix of vehicles operating under weak lane discipline (HWLD), encompassing both motorised and non-motorised modes with diverse sizes and manoeuvrability. These conditions lead to complex driver interactions, complicating the reliable identification of vehicle-following (VF) behaviour and leader-follower (LF) pairs. Traditional identification methods based on fixed thresholds for longitudinal and lateral proximity often misclassify non-following instances as valid LF pairs, degrading model performance. This study presents a refined and adaptive method for LF identification in HWLD traffic. It employs vehicle-type- and speed-specific desirable gap thresholds derived from the fundamental density-speed diagram to eliminate false-positive pairs. Additionally, Mexican Hat Wavelet Transform (MWT) is employed to analyse LV and SV speed profiles, verifying LV-SV interaction for LF pair identification. The three-stage filtering includes: (i) speed-gap consistency, (ii) approach/diverge detection via relative velocity sign changes and gap range, and (iii) wavelet-based speed correlation using MWT to confirm LV influence on SV. The framework effectively filters out LF pairs associated with overtaking, tailgating, and inconsistent gap dynamics, retaining only those with consistent VF behaviour and improving model accuracy. Analysis across thirteen LF combinations shows that VF dynamics depend on both SV and LV types. Symmetric pairs (e.g., CAR-CAR, AUTO-CAR) exhibit higher predictability and lower errors, while asymmetric pairs with heavy vehicles or two-wheelers show greater variability. The framework offers a robust foundation for traffic modelling and behaviour analysis.</p></details> |  |

Existing datasets, focused on detection and localization, lack the annotations required for this legal reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce the \textbf{C}hinese \textbf{A}ccident \textbf{D}uty-determination \textbf{D}ataset (\textbf{CADD}), the first benchmark for statute-based liability attribution. CADD contains 792 real-world driving recorder videos, each annotated within a novel \textbf{``Behavior--Liability--Statute''} pipeline. This framework provides \textbf{granular, symmetric behavior annotations}, clear responsibility assignments, and, uniquely, links each case to the specific \textbf{Chinese traffic law statute} violated. We demonstrate the utility of CADD through detailed analysis and establish benchmarks for liability prediction and explainable decision-making. By directly connecting perceptual data to legal consequences, CADD provides a foundational resource for developing accountable and legally-grounded autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |

An Extensive Approach Considering Statistical, Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09450v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With rapid urbanization in recent decades, traffic congestion has intensified due to increased movement of people and goods. As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE. The study concludes by identifying hybrid models as a promising future direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>6,227...</summary><p>6,227 words text + 2*250 (2 tables) = 6,727 words</p></details> |

A core technology for analyzing such images, associated with spatiotemporal information, is Traffic Scene Understanding (TSU), which aims to provide a comprehensive description of the traffic scene. Unlike traditional spatio-temporal data analysis tasks, the dependence on both spatio-temporal and visual-textual data introduces distinct challenges to TSU task. However, recent research often treats TSU as a common image understanding task, ignoring the spatio-temporal information and overlooking the interrelations between different aspects of the traffic scene. To address these issues, we propose a novel SpatioTemporal Enhanced Model based on CILP (ST-CLIP) for TSU. Our model uses the classic vision-language model, CLIP, as the backbone, and designs a Spatio-temporal Context Aware Multiaspect Prompt (SCAMP) learning method to incorporate spatiotemporal information into TSU. The prompt learning method consists of two components: A dynamic spatio-temporal context representation module that extracts representation vectors of spatio-temporal data for each traffic scene image, and a bi-level ST-aware multi-aspect prompt learning module that integrates the ST-context representation vectors into word embeddings of prompts for the CLIP model. The second module also extracts low-level visual features and image-wise high-level semantic features to exploit interactive relations among different aspects of traffic scenes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate spatio-temporal information into visionlanguage models to facilitate TSU task. Experiments on two realworld datasets demonstrate superior performance in the complex scene understanding scenarios with a few-shot learning strategy.</p></details> |  |

These limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction performance and lightweight deployment.Our code is available at https://github.com/jinguangyin/M3_NET</p></details> |  |

Macroscopic emission fundamental diagram (eMFD)captures an orderly relationship among emission and aggregated traffic variables at the network level, allowing for real-time monitoring of region-wide emissions and optimal allocation of travel demand to existing networks, reducing urban congestion and associated emissions. However, empirically derived eMFD models are sparse due to historical data limitation. Leveraging a large-scale and granular traffic and emission data derived from probe vehicles, this study is the first to apply machine learning methods to predict the network wide emission rate to traffic relationship in U.S. urban areas at a large scale. The analysis framework and insights developed in this work generate data-driven eMFDs and a deeper understanding of their location dependence on network, infrastructure, land use, and vehicle characteristics, enabling transportation authorities to measure carbon emissions from urban transport of given travel demand and optimize location specific traffic management and planning decisions to mitigate network-wide emissions.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 pag...</summary><p>3 pages, 5 figures, IEEE Big Data 2024 conference</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting Network Traffic Analysis: Compatible network flows for ML models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08345v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To ensure that Machine Learning (ML) models can perform a robust detection and classification of cyberattacks, it is essential to train them with high-quality datasets with relevant features. However, it can be difficult to accurately represent the complex traffic patterns of an attack, especially in Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. This paper studies the impact that seemingly similar features created by different network traffic flow exporters can have on the generalization and robustness of ML models. In addition to the original CSV files of the Bot-IoT, IoT-23, and CICIoT23 datasets, the raw network packets of their PCAP files were analysed with the HERA tool, generating new labelled flows and extracting consistent features for new CSV versions. To assess the usefulness of these new flows for intrusion detection, they were compared with the original versions and were used to fine-tune multiple models. Overall, the results indicate that directly analysing and preprocessing PCAP files, instead of just using the commonly available CSV files, enables the computation of more relevant features to train bagging and gradient boosting decision tree ensembles. It is important to continue improving feature extraction and feature selection processes to make different datasets more compatible and enable a trustworthy evaluation and comparison of the ML models used in cybersecurity solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 12 tables, 1 figure, FPS 2025 conference</p></details> |
| **[Capturing Complex Spatial-Temporal Dependencies in Traffic Forecasting: A Self-Attention Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07980v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of traffic forecasting, aiming to predict the inflow and outflow of a region in the subsequent time slot. The problem is complex due to the intricate spatial and temporal interdependence among regions. Prior works study the spatial and temporal dependency in a decouple manner, failing to capture their joint effect. In this work, we propose ST-SAM, a novel and efficient Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention Model for traffic forecasting. ST-SAM uses a region embedding layer to learn time-specific embedding from traffic data for regions. Then, it employs a spatial-temporal dependency learning module based on self-attention mechanism to capture the joint spatial-temporal dependency for both nearby and faraway regions. ST-SAM entirely relies on self-attention to capture both local and global spatial-temporal correlations, which make it effective and efficient. Extensive experiments on two real world datasets show that ST-SAM is substantially more accurate and efficient than the state-of-the-art approaches (with an average improvement of up to 15% on RMSE, 17% on MAPE, and 32 times on training time in our experiments).</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[Virtual Traffic Lights for Multi-Robot Navigation: Decentralized Planning with Centralized Conflict Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07811v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a hybrid multi-robot coordination framework that combines decentralized path planning with centralized conflict resolution. In our approach, each robot autonomously plans its path and shares this information with a centralized node. The centralized system detects potential conflicts and allows only one of the conflicting robots to proceed at a time, instructing others to stop outside the conflicting area to avoid deadlocks. Unlike traditional centralized planning methods, our system does not dictate robot paths but instead provides stop commands, functioning as a virtual traffic light. In simulation experiments with multiple robots, our approach increased the success rate of robots reaching their goals while reducing deadlocks. Furthermore, we successfully validated the system in real-world experiments with two quadruped robots and separately with wheeled Duckiebots.</p></details> |  |
| **[MULTI-LF: A Continuous Learning Framework for Real-Time Malicious Traffic Detection in Multi-Environment Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11575v2)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-environment (M-En) networks integrate diverse traffic sources, including Internet of Things (IoT) and traditional computing systems, creating complex and evolving conditions for malicious traffic detection. Existing machine learning (ML)-based approaches, typically trained on static single-domain datasets, often fail to generalize across heterogeneous network environments. To address this gap, we develop a realistic Docker-NS3-based testbed that emulates both IoT and traditional traffic conditions, enabling the generation and capture of live, labeled network flows. The resulting M-En Dataset combines this traffic with curated public PCAP traces to provide comprehensive coverage of benign and malicious behaviors. Building on this foundation, we propose Multi-LF, a real-time continuous learning framework that combines a lightweight model (M1) for rapid detection with a deeper model (M2) for high-confidence refinement and adaptation. A confidence-based coordination mechanism enhances efficiency without compromising accuracy, while weight interpolation mitigates catastrophic forgetting during continuous updates. Features extracted at 1-second intervals capture fine-grained temporal patterns, enabling early recognition of evolving attack behaviors. Implemented and evaluated within the Docker-NS3 testbed on live traffic, Multi-LF achieves an accuracy of 0.999 while requiring human intervention for only 0.0026 percent of packets, demonstrating its effectiveness and practicality for real-time malicious traffic detection in heterogeneous network environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version (v2) corresponds to the revised manuscript submitted to the Journal of Network and Computer Applications (Elsevier).

| **[Convergence of Multiagent Learning Systems for Traffic control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11654v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid urbanization in cities like Bangalore has led to severe traffic congestion, making efficient Traffic Signal Control (TSC) essential. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), often modeling each traffic signal as an independent agent using Q-learning, has emerged as a promising strategy to reduce average commuter delays. While prior work Prashant L A et. al has empirically demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach, a rigorous theoretical analysis of its stability and convergence properties in the context of traffic control has not been explored. This paper bridges that gap by focusing squarely on the theoretical basis of this multi-agent algorithm. We investigate the convergence problem inherent in using independent learners for the cooperative TSC task. Utilizing stochastic approximation methods, we formally analyze the learning dynamics. The primary contribution of this work is the proof that the specific multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm for traffic control is proven to converge under the given conditions extending it from single agent convergence proofs for asynchronous value iteration.</p></details> | 14 pages 2 figures |
| **[On the Redundant Distributed Observability of Mixed Traffic Transportation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06950v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, the problem of distributed state estimation of human-driven vehicles (HDVs) by connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is investigated in mixed traffic transportation systems. Toward this, a distributed observable state-space model is derived, which paves the way for estimation and observability analysis of HDVs in mixed traffic scenarios. In this direction, first, we obtain the condition on the network topology to satisfy the distributed observability, i.e., the condition such that each HDV state is observable to every CAV via information-exchange over the network. It is shown that strong connectivity of the network, along with the proper design of the observer gain, is sufficient for this. A distributed observer is then designed by locally sharing estimates/observations of each CAV with its neighborhood. Second, in case there exist faulty sensors or unreliable observation data, we derive the condition for redundant distributed observability as a $q$-node/link-connected network design. This redundancy is achieved by extra information-sharing over the network and implies that a certain number of faulty sensors and unreliable links can be isolated/removed without losing the observability. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>EURAS...</summary><p>EURASIP journal on advances in signal processing</p></details> |

FedNET employs Federated Learning (FL) to model the temporal evolution of node-level traffic in a distributed manner, enabling accurate multi-step-ahead predictions (e.g., several hours to days) without exposing sensitive network data. Using these node-level forecasts and known routing information, FedNET estimates the future link-level utilization by aggregating traffic contributions across all source-destination pairs. The links are then ranked according to the predicted load intensity and temporal variability, providing an early warning signal for potential high-risk links. We compare the federated traffic prediction of FedNET against a centralized multi-step learning baseline and then systematically analyze the impact of history and prediction window sizes on forecast accuracy using the $R^2$ score. Results indicate that FL achieves accuracy close to centralized training, with shorter prediction horizons consistently yielding the highest accuracy ($R^2 >0.92$), while longer horizons providing meaningful forecasts ($R^2 \approx 0.45\text{--}0.55$). We further validate the efficacy of the FedNET framework in predicting network utilization on a realistic network topology and demonstrate that it consistently identifies high-risk links well in advance (i.e., three days ahead) of the critical stress states emerging, making it a practical tool for anticipatory traffic engineering and capacity planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Vehicles at Unsignalized Intersections: Safety and Efficiency Implications of Mixed Human and Automated Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12538v3)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of automated vehicles (AVs) into transportation systems presents an unprecedented opportunity to enhance road safety and efficiency. However, understanding the interactions between AVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs) at intersections remains an open research question. This study aims to bridge this gap by examining behavioral differences and adaptations of AVs and HVs at unsignalized intersections by utilizing two large-scale AV datasets from Waymo and Lyft. By using a systematic methodology, the research identifies and analyzes merging and crossing conflicts by calculating key safety and efficiency metrics, including time to collision (TTC), post-encroachment time (PET), maximum required deceleration (MRD), time advantage (TA), and speed and acceleration profiles. Through this approach, the study assesses the safety and efficiency implications of these behavioral differences and adaptations for mixed-autonomy traffic. The findings reveal a paradox: while AVs maintain larger safety margins, their conservative behavior can lead to unexpected situations for human drivers, potentially causing unsafe conditions. From a performance point of view, human drivers tend to exhibit more consistent behavior when interacting with AVs versus other HVs, suggesting AVs may contribute to harmonizing traffic flow patterns. Moreover, notable differences were observed between Waymo and Lyft vehicles, which highlights the importance of considering manufacturer-specific AV behaviors in traffic modeling and management strategies for the safe integration of AVs. The processed dataset, as well as the developed algorithms and scripts, are openly published to foster research on AV-HV interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published OnlineFirst in Transportation Research Record (TRR), DOI: 10.1177/03611981251370343</p></details> |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning for Fair and Efficient Urban Traffic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06363v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The optimization of urban traffic is threatened by the complexity of achieving a balance between transport efficiency and the maintenance of privacy, as well as the equitable distribution of traffic based on socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods. Current centralized traffic management schemes invade user location privacy and further entrench traffic disparity by offering disadvantaged route suggestions, whereas current federated learning frameworks do not consider fairness constraints in multi-objective traffic settings. This study presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework, termed FedFair-Traffic, that jointly and simultaneously optimizes travel efficiency, traffic fairness, and differential privacy protection. This is the first attempt to integrate three conflicting objectives to improve urban transportation systems. The proposed methodology enables collaborative learning between related vehicles with data locality by integrating Graph Neural Networks with differential privacy mechanisms ($ε$-privacy guarantees) and Gini coefficient-based fair constraints using multi-objective optimization. The framework uses federated aggregation methods of gradient clipping and noise injection to provide differential privacy and optimize Pareto-efficient solutions for the efficiency-fairness tradeoff. Real-world comprehensive experiments on the METR-LA traffic dataset showed that FedFair-Traffic can reduce the average travel time by 7\% (14.2 minutes) compared with their centralized baselines, promote traffic fairness by 73\% (Gini coefficient, 0.78), and offer high privacy protection (privacy score, 0.8) with an 89\% reduction in communication overhead. These outcomes demonstrate that FedFair-Traffic is a scalable privacy-aware smart city infrastructure with possible use-cases in metropolitan traffic flow control and federated transportation networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at IEEE journal</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Guided Reinforcement Learning with Representative Agents for Traffic Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06260v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as behavioral proxies for self-interested travelers in agent-based traffic models. Although more flexible and generalizable than conventional models, the practical use of these approaches remains limited by scalability due to the cost of calling one LLM for every traveler. Moreover, it has been found that LLM agents often make opaque choices and produce unstable day-to-day dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose to model each homogeneous traveler group facing the same decision context with a single representative LLM agent who behaves like the population's average, maintaining and updating a mixed strategy over routes that coincides with the group's aggregate flow proportions. Each day, the LLM reviews the travel experience and flags routes with positive reinforcement that they hope to use more often, and an interpretable update rule then converts this judgment into strategy adjustments using a tunable (progressively decaying) step size. The representative-agent design improves scalability, while the separation of reasoning from updating clarifies the decision logic while stabilizing learning. In classic traffic assignment settings, we find that the proposed approach converges rapidly to the user equilibrium. In richer settings with income heterogeneity, multi-criteria costs, and multi-modal choices, the generated dynamics remain stable and interpretable, reproducing plausible behavioral patterns well-documented in psychology and economics, for example, the decoy effect in toll versus non-toll road selection, and higher willingness-to-pay for convenience among higher-income travelers when choosing between driving, transit, and park-and-ride options.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Origin-Destination Matrix Estimation in Microscopic Traffic Simulations Considering Credit Assignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06229v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on dynamic origin-destination matrix estimation (DODE), a crucial calibration process necessary for the effective application of microscopic traffic simulations. The fundamental challenge of the DODE problem in microscopic simulations stems from the complex temporal dynamics and inherent uncertainty of individual vehicle dynamics. This makes it highly challenging to precisely determine which vehicle traverses which link at any given moment, resulting in intricate and often ambiguous relationships between origin-destination (OD) matrices and their contributions to resultant link flows. This phenomenon constitutes the credit assignment problem, a central challenge addressed in this study. We formulate the DODE problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a novel framework that applies model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Within our proposed framework, the agent learns an optimal policy to sequentially generate OD matrices, refining its strategy through direct interaction with the simulation environment. The proposed method is validated on the Nguyen-Dupuis network using SUMO, where its performance is evaluated against ground-truth link flows aggregated at 5-minute intervals over a 30-minute horizon. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a 43.2% reduction in mean squared error (MSE) compared to the best-performing conventional baseline. By reframing DODE as a sequential decision-making problem, our approach addresses the credit assignment challenge through its learned policy, thereby overcoming the limitations of conventional methods and proposing a novel framework for calibration of microscopic traffic simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Neural policies, however, tend to be over-parameterized and non-transparent, hindering their interpretability and deployability on resource-limited edge devices. This work presents SymLight, a priority function search framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for discovering inherently interpretable and deployable symbolic priority functions to serve as the TSC policies. The priority function, in particular, accepts traffic features as input and then outputs a priority for each traffic signal phase, which subsequently directs the phase transition. For effective search, we propose a concise yet expressive priority function representation. This helps mitigate the combinatorial explosion of the action space in MCTS. Additionally, a probabilistic structural rollout strategy is introduced to leverage structural patterns from previously discovered high-quality priority functions, guiding the rollout process. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate SymLight's superior performance across a range of baselines. A key advantage is SymLight's ability to produce interpretable and deployable TSC policies while maintaining excellent performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[BLADE: Behavior-Level Anomaly Detection Using Network Traffic in Web Services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05193v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With their widespread popularity, web services have become the main targets of various cyberattacks. Existing traffic anomaly detection approaches focus on flow-level attacks, yet fail to recognize behavior-level attacks, which appear benign in individual flows but reveal malicious purpose using multiple network flows. To transcend this limitation, we propose a novel unsupervised traffic anomaly detection system, BLADE, capable of detecting not only flow-level but also behavior-level attacks in web services. Our key observation is that application-layer operations of web services exhibit distinctive communication patterns at the network layer from a multi-flow perspective. BLADE first exploits a flow autoencoder to learn a latent feature representation and calculates its reconstruction losses per flow. Then, the latent representation is assigned a pseudo operation label using an unsupervised clustering method. Next, an anomaly score is computed based on the reconstruction losses. Finally, the triplets of timestamps, pseudo labels, and anomaly scores from multiple flows are aggregated and fed into a one-class classifier to characterize the behavior patterns of legitimate web operations, enabling the detection of flow-level and behavior-level anomalies. BLADE is extensively evaluated on both the custom dataset and the CIC-IDS2017 dataset. The experimental results demonstrate BLADE's superior performance, achieving high F1 scores of 0.9732 and 0.9801, respectively, on the two datasets, and outperforming traditional single-flow anomaly detection baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE MSN 2025</p></details> |
| **[Self-Interest and Systemic Benefits: Emergence of Collective Rationality in Mixed Autonomy Traffic Through Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04883v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to be commercially available in the near future, leading to mixed autonomy traffic consisting of both AVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs). Although numerous studies have shown that AVs can be deployed to benefit the overall traffic system performance by incorporating system-level goals into their decision making, it is not clear whether the benefits still exist when agents act out of self-interest -- a trait common to all driving agents, both human and autonomous. This study aims to understand whether self-interested AVs can bring benefits to all driving agents in mixed autonomy traffic systems. The research is centered on the concept of collective rationality (CR). This concept, originating from game theory and behavioral economics, means that driving agents may cooperate collectively even when pursuing individual interests. Our recent research has proven the existence of CR in an analytical game-theoretical model and empirically in mixed human-driven traffic. In this paper, we demonstrate that CR can be attained among driving agents trained using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with a simple reward design. We examine the extent to which self-interested traffic agents can achieve CR without directly incorporating system-level objectives. Results show that CR consistently emerges in various scenarios, which indicates the robustness of this property. We also postulate a mechanism to explain the emergence of CR in the microscopic and dynamic environment and verify it based on simulation evidence. This research suggests the possibility of leveraging advanced learning methods (such as federated learning) to achieve collective cooperation among self-interested driving agents in mixed-autonomy systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smartphone User Fingerprinting on Wireless Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03229v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the openness of the wireless medium, smartphone users are susceptible to user privacy attacks, where user privacy information is inferred from encrypted Wi-Fi wireless traffic. Existing attacks are limited to recognizing mobile apps and their actions and cannot infer the smartphone user identity, a fundamental part of user privacy. To overcome this limitation, we propose U-Print, a novel attack system that can passively recognize smartphone apps, actions, and users from over-the-air MAC-layer frames. We observe that smartphone users usually prefer different add-on apps and in-app actions, yielding different changing patterns in Wi-Fi traffic. U-Print first extracts multi-level traffic features and exploits customized temporal convolutional networks to recognize smartphone apps and actions, thus producing users' behavior sequences. Then, it leverages the silhouette coefficient method to determine the number of users and applies the k-means clustering to profile and identify smartphone users. We implement U-Print using a laptop with a Kali dual-band wireless network card and evaluate it in three real-world environments. U-Print achieves an overall accuracy of 98.4% and an F1 score of 0.983 for user inference. Moreover, it can correctly recognize up to 96% of apps and actions in the closed world and more than 86% in the open world.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.07263</p></details> |
| **[Modeling Headway in Heterogeneous and Mixed Traffic Flow: A Statistical Distribution Based on a General Exponential Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03154v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability of existing headway distributions to accurately reflect the diverse behaviors and characteristics in heterogeneous traffic (different types of vehicles) and mixed traffic (human-driven vehicles with autonomous vehicles) is limited, leading to unsatisfactory goodness of fit. To address these issues, we modified the exponential function to obtain a novel headway distribution. Rather than employing Euler's number (e) as the base of the exponential function, we utilized a real number base to provide greater flexibility in modeling the observed headway. However, the proposed is not a probability function. We normalize it to calculate the probability and derive the closed-form equation. In this study, we utilized a comprehensive experiment with five open datasets: highD, exiD, NGSIM, Waymo, and Lyft to evaluate the performance of the proposed distribution and compared its performance with six existing distributions under mixed and heterogeneous traffic flow. The results revealed that the proposed distribution not only captures the fundamental characteristics of headway distribution but also provides physically meaningful parameters that describe the distribution shape of observed headways. Under heterogeneous flow on highways (i.e., uninterrupted traffic flow), the proposed distribution outperforms other candidate distributions. Under urban road conditions (i.e., interrupted traffic flow), including heterogeneous and mixed traffic, the proposed distribution still achieves decent results.</p></details> |  |

The dataset comprises 26,646 high-resolution (1080p) images sampled from 2800 Bengaluru's Safe-City CCTV cameras over a 4-week period, and subsequently annotated through a crowdsourced hackathon involving 565 college students from across India. In total, 1.8 million bounding boxes were labeled across 14 vehicle classes specific to India: Cycle, 2-Wheeler (Motorcycle), 3-Wheeler (Auto-rickshaw), LCV (Light Commercial Vehicles), Van, Tempo-traveller, Hatchback, Sedan, SUV, MUV, Mini-bus, Bus, Truck and Other. Of these, 283k-316k consensus ground truth bounding boxes and labels were derived for distinct objects in the 26k images using Majority Voting and STAPLE algorithms. Further, we train multiple contemporary detectors, including YOLO11-S/X, RT-DETR-S/X, and DAMO-YOLO-T/L using these datasets, and report accuracy based on mAP50, mAP75 and mAP50:95. Models trained on UVH-26 achieve 8.4-31.5% improvements in mAP50:95 over equivalent baseline models trained on COCO dataset, with RT-DETR-X showing the best performance at 0.67 (mAP50:95) as compared to 0.40 for COCO-trained weights for common classes (Car, Bus, and Truck). This demonstrates the benefits of domain-specific training data for Indian traffic scenarios. The release package provides the 26k images with consensus annotations based on Majority Voting (UVH-26-MV) and STAPLE (UVH-26-ST) and the 6 fine-tuned YOLO and DETR models on each of these datasets. By capturing the heterogeneity of Indian urban mobility directly from operational traffic-camera streams, UVH-26 addresses a critical gap in existing global benchmarks, and offers a foundation for advancing detection, classification, and deployment of intelligent transportation systems in emerging nations with complex traffic conditions.</p></details> |  |

However, such testing is limited by the scarcity of long-tailed, safety-critical scenarios in existing datasets collected in the real world. To tackle the data issue, we propose the Adv-BMT framework, which augments real-world scenarios with diverse and realistic adversarial traffic interactions. The core component of Adv-BMT is a bidirectional motion transformer (BMT) model to perform inverse traffic motion predictions, which takes agent information in the last time step of the scenario as input, and reconstructs the traffic in the inverse of chronological order until the initial time step. The Adv-BMT framework is a two-staged pipeline: it first conducts adversarial initializations and then inverse motion predictions. Different from previous work, we do not need any collision data for pretraining, and are able to generate realistic and diverse collision interactions. Our experimental results validate the quality of generated collision scenarios by Adv-BMT: training in our augmented dataset would reduce episode collision rates by 20%.

| **[A Spatio-Temporal Online Robust Tensor Recovery Approach for Streaming Traffic Data Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01267v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data quality is critical to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), as complete and accurate traffic data underpin reliable decision-making in traffic control and management. Recent advances in low-rank tensor recovery algorithms have shown strong potential in capturing the inherent structure of high-dimensional traffic data and restoring degraded observations. However, traditional batch-based methods demand substantial computational and storage resources, which limits their scalability in the face of continuously expanding traffic data volumes. Moreover, recent online tensor recovery methods often suffer from severe performance degradation in complex real-world scenarios due to their insufficient exploitation of the intrinsic structural properties of traffic data. To address these challenges, we reformulate the traffic data recovery problem within a streaming framework, and propose a novel online robust tensor recovery algorithm that simultaneously leverages both the global spatio-temporal correlations and local consistency of traffic data, achieving high recovery accuracy and significantly improved computational efficiency in large-scale scenarios. Our method is capable of simultaneously handling missing and anomalous values in traffic data, and demonstrates strong adaptability across diverse missing patterns. Experimental results on three real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high recovery accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency by up to three orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art batch-based methods. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed approach as a scalable and effective solution for traffic data quality enhancement in ITS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-agent Reinforcement Learning Model for Regional Adaptive Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00551v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several studies have employed reinforcement learning (RL) to address the challenges of regional adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) and achieved promising results. In this field, existing research predominantly adopts multi-agent frameworks. However, the adoption of multi-agent frameworks presents challenges for scalability. Instead, the Traffic signal control (TSC) problem necessitates a single-agent framework. TSC inherently relies on centralized management by a single control center, which can monitor traffic conditions across all roads in the study area and coordinate the control of all intersections. This work proposes a single-agent RL-based regional ATSC model compatible with probe vehicle technology. Key components of the RL design include state, action, and reward function definitions. To facilitate learning and manage congestion, both state and reward functions are defined based on queue length, with action designed to regulate queue dynamics. The queue length definition used in this study differs slightly from conventional definitions but is closely correlated with congestion states. More importantly, it allows for reliable estimation using link travel time data from probe vehicles. With probe vehicle data already covering most urban roads, this feature enhances the proposed method's potential for widespread deployment. The method was comprehensively evaluated using the SUMO simulation platform. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively mitigates large-scale regional congestion levels via coordinated multi-intersection control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Single-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Regional Traffic Signal Control Under Demand Fluctuations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00549v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic congestion, primarily driven by intersection queuing, significantly impacts urban living standards, safety, environmental quality, and economic efficiency. While Traffic Signal Control (TSC) systems hold potential for congestion mitigation, traditional optimization models often fail to capture real-world traffic complexity and dynamics. This study introduces a novel single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework for regional adaptive TSC, circumventing the coordination complexities inherent in multi-agent systems through a centralized decision-making paradigm. The model employs an adjacency matrix to unify the encoding of road network topology, real-time queue states derived from probe vehicle data, and current signal timing parameters. Leveraging the efficient learning capabilities of the DreamerV3 world model, the agent learns control policies where actions sequentially select intersections and adjust their signal phase splits to regulate traffic inflow/outflow, analogous to a feedback control system. Reward design prioritizes queue dissipation, directly linking congestion metrics (queue length) to control actions. Simulation experiments conducted in SUMO demonstrate the model's effectiveness: under inference scenarios with multi-level (10%, 20%, 30%) Origin-Destination (OD) demand fluctuations, the framework exhibits robust anti-fluctuation capability and significantly reduces queue lengths. This work establishes a new paradigm for intelligent traffic control compatible with probe vehicle technology. Future research will focus on enhancing practical applicability by incorporating stochastic OD demand fluctuations during training and exploring regional optimization mechanisms for contingency events.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information-Theoretic Greedy Layer-wise Training for Traffic Sign Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27651v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained with a global cross-entropy loss in a supervised end-to-end manner: neurons need to store their outgoing weights; training alternates between a forward pass (computation) and a top-down backward pass (learning) which is biologically implausible. Alternatively, greedy layer-wise training eliminates the need for cross-entropy loss and backpropagation. By avoiding the computation of intermediate gradients and the storage of intermediate outputs, it reduces memory usage and helps mitigate issues such as vanishing or exploding gradients. However, most existing layer-wise training approaches have been evaluated only on relatively small datasets with simple deep architectures. In this paper, we first systematically analyze the training dynamics of popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) through an information-theoretic lens. Our findings reveal that networks converge layer-by-layer from bottom to top and that the flow of information adheres to a Markov information bottleneck principle. Building on these observations, we propose a novel layer-wise training approach based on the recently developed deterministic information bottleneck (DIB) and the matrix-based Rényi's $α$-order entropy functional. Specifically, each layer is trained jointly with an auxiliary classifier that connects directly to the output layer, enabling the learning of minimal sufficient task-relevant representations. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our training procedure on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using modern deep CNNs and further demonstrate its applicability to a practical task involving traffic sign recognition. Our approach not only outperforms existing layer-wise training baselines but also achieves performance comparable to SGD.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Dual Large Language Models Architecture with Herald Guided Prompts for Parallel Fine Grained Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00136v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging large language models (LLMs) in traffic signal control (TSC) improves optimization efficiency and interpretability compared to traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods. However, existing LLM-based approaches are limited by fixed time signal durations and are prone to hallucination errors, while RL methods lack robustness in signal timing decisions and suffer from poor generalization. To address these challenges, this paper proposes HeraldLight, a dual LLMs architecture enhanced by Herald guided prompts. The Herald Module extracts contextual information and forecasts queue lengths for each traffic phase based on real-time conditions. The first LLM, LLM-Agent, uses these forecasts to make fine grained traffic signal control, while the second LLM, LLM-Critic, refines LLM-Agent's outputs, correcting errors and hallucinations. These refined outputs are used for score-based fine-tuning to improve accuracy and robustness. Simulation experiments using CityFlow on real world datasets covering 224 intersections in Jinan (12), Hangzhou (16), and New York (196) demonstrate that HeraldLight outperforms state of the art baselines, achieving a 20.03% reduction in average travel time across all scenarios and a 10.74% reduction in average queue length on the Jinan and Hangzhou scenarios.

Traditional batch learning models face challenges such as high maintenance and poor adaptability to rapid anomaly changes, known as concept drift. In contrast, streaming learning integrates online and incremental learning, enabling seamless updates and concept drift detection to improve robustness. This study investigates anomaly detection in streaming IoT traffic as binary classification, comparing batch and streaming learning approaches while assessing the limitations of current IoT traffic datasets. We simulated heterogeneous network data streams by carefully mixing existing datasets and streaming the samples one by one. Our results highlight the failure of batch models to handle concept drift, but also reveal persisting limitations of current datasets to expose model limitations due to low traffic heterogeneity. We also investigated the competitiveness of tree-based ML algorithms, well-known in batch anomaly detection, and compared it to non-tree-based ones, confirming the advantages of the former. Adaptive Random Forest achieved F1-score of 0.990 $\pm$ 0.006 at one-third the computational cost of its batch counterpart. Hoeffding Adaptive Tree reached F1-score of 0.910 $\pm$ 0.007, reducing computational cost by four times, making it a viable choice for online applications despite a slight trade-off in stability.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Traditional accident prediction models treat road segments independently, failing to capture complex spatial relationships and temporal dependencies in urban transportation networks. This study develops MDAS-GNN, a Multi-Dimensional Attention-based Spatial-diffusion Graph Neural Network integrating three core risk dimensions: traffic safety, infrastructure, and environmental risk. The framework employs feature-specific spatial diffusion mechanisms and multi-head temporal attention to capture dependencies across different time horizons. Evaluated on UK Department for Transport accident data across Central London, South Manchester, and SE Birmingham, MDASGNN achieves superior performance compared to established baseline methods. The model maintains consistently low prediction errors across short, medium, and long-term periods, with particular strength in long-term forecasting. Ablation studies confirm that integrated multi-dimensional features outperform singlefeature approaches, reducing prediction errors by up to 40%. This framework provides civil engineers and urban planners with advanced predictive capabilities for transportation infrastructure design, enabling data-driven decisions for road network optimization, infrastructure resource improvements, and strategic safety interventions in urban development projects.</p></details> |  |

However, existing MLLMs in this domain primarily focus on coarse-grained image-level or video-level comprehension and often struggle to handle fine-grained visual details or localized scene components, limiting their applicability in complex accident scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose SafePLUG, a novel framework that empowers MLLMs with both Pixel-Level Understanding and temporal Grounding for comprehensive traffic accident analysis. SafePLUG supports both arbitrary-shaped visual prompts for region-aware question answering and pixel-level segmentation based on language instructions, while also enabling the recognition of temporally anchored events in traffic accident scenarios. To advance the development of MLLMs for traffic accident understanding, we curate a new dataset containing multimodal question-answer pairs centered on diverse accident scenarios, with detailed pixel-level annotations and temporal event boundaries. Experimental results show that SafePLUG achieves strong performance on multiple tasks, including region-based question answering, pixel-level segmentation, temporal event localization, and accident event understanding. These capabilities lay a foundation for fine-grained understanding of complex traffic scenes, with the potential to improve driving safety and enhance situational awareness in smart transportation systems.

| **[A Cloud-Based Spatio-Temporal GNN-Transformer Hybrid Model for Traffic Flow Forecasting with External Feature Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27039v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate traffic flow forecasting is essential for the development of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), supporting tasks such as traffic signal optimization, congestion management, and route planning. Traditional models often fail to effectively capture complex spatial-temporal dependencies in large-scale road networks, especially under the influence of external factors such as weather, holidays, and traffic accidents. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a cloud-based hybrid model that integrates Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNN) with a Transformer architecture for traffic flow prediction. The model leverages the strengths of GNNs in modeling spatial correlations across road networks and the Transformers' ability to capture long-term temporal dependencies. External contextual features are incorporated via feature fusion to enhance predictive accuracy. The proposed model is deployed on a cloud computing platform to achieve scalability and real-time adaptability. Experimental evaluation of the dataset shows that our model outperforms baseline methods (LSTM, TCN, GCN, pure Transformer) with an RMSE of only 17.92 and a MAE of only 10.53. These findings suggest that the hybrid GNN-Transformer approach provides an effective and scalable solution for cloud-based ITS applications, offering methodological advancements for traffic flow forecasting and practical implications for congestion mitigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval Augmented Generation-Enhanced Distributed LLM Agents for Generalizable Traffic Signal Control with Emergency Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26242v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3 adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17 to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[DARTS: A Drone-Based AI-Powered Real-Time Traffic Incident Detection System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26004v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid and reliable incident detection is critical for reducing crash-related fatalities, injuries, and congestion. However, conventional methods, such as closed-circuit television, dashcam footage, and sensor-based detection, separate detection from verification, suffer from limited flexibility, and require dense infrastructure or high penetration rates, restricting adaptability and scalability to shifting incident hotspots. To overcome these challenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic incident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial perspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better low-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep learning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident detection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected dataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity assessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a web-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS detected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local transportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion propagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and enable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk. Crucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on frequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and cost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings. This study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated real-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for the operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation management.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version.

| **[VISAT: Benchmarking Adversarial and Distribution Shift Robustness in Traffic Sign Recognition with Visual Attributes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26833v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present VISAT, a novel open dataset and benchmarking suite for evaluating model robustness in the task of traffic sign recognition with the presence of visual attributes. Built upon the Mapillary Traffic Sign Dataset (MTSD), our dataset introduces two benchmarks that respectively emphasize robustness against adversarial attacks and distribution shifts. For our adversarial attack benchmark, we employ the state-of-the-art Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) method to generate adversarial inputs and evaluate their impact on popular models. Additionally, we investigate the effect of adversarial attacks on attribute-specific multi-task learning (MTL) networks, revealing spurious correlations among MTL tasks. The MTL networks leverage visual attributes (color, shape, symbol, and text) that we have created for each traffic sign in our dataset. For our distribution shift benchmark, we utilize ImageNet-C's realistic data corruption and natural variation techniques to perform evaluations on the robustness of both base and MTL models. Moreover, we further explore spurious correlations among MTL tasks through synthetic alterations of traffic sign colors using color quantization techniques. Our experiments focus on two major backbones, ResNet-152 and ViT-B/32, and compare the performance between base and MTL models. The VISAT dataset and benchmarking framework contribute to the understanding of model robustness for traffic sign recognition, shedding light on the challenges posed by adversarial attacks and distribution shifts. We believe this work will facilitate advancements in developing more robust models for real-world applications in autonomous driving and cyber-physical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Pre-Padding: Generating Evasive Network Traffic Against Transformer-Based Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25810v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To date, traffic obfuscation techniques have been widely adopted to protect network data privacy and security by obscuring the true patterns of traffic. Nevertheless, as the pre-trained models emerge, especially transformer-based classifiers, existing traffic obfuscation methods become increasingly vulnerable, as witnessed by current studies reporting the traffic classification accuracy up to 99\% or higher. To counter such high-performance transformer-based classification models, we in this paper propose a novel and effective \underline{adv}ersarial \underline{traffic}-generating approach (AdvTraffic\footnote{The code and data are available at: http://xxx}). Our approach has two key innovations: (i) a pre-padding strategy is proposed to modify packets, which effectively overcomes the limitations of existing research against transformer-based models for network traffic classification; and (ii) a reinforcement learning model is employed to optimize network traffic perturbations, aiming to maximize adversarial effectiveness against transformer-based classification models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply adversarial perturbation techniques to defend against transformer-based traffic classifiers. Furthermore, our method can be easily deployed into practical network environments. Finally, multi-faceted experiments are conducted across several real-world datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively undermine transformer-based classifiers, significantly reducing classification accuracy from 99\% to as low as 25.68\%.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot and few-shot generalization across diverse domains, yet their effectiveness for computer networking remains unexplored. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of a TSFM, IBM's Tiny Time Mixer (TTM), on the CESNET-TimeSeries24 dataset, a 40-week real-world ISP telemetry corpus. We assess TTM under zero-shot and few-shot settings across multiple forecasting horizons (hours to days), aggregation hierarchies (institutions, subnets, IPs), and temporal resolutions (10-minute and hourly). Results show that TTM achieves consistent accuracy (RMSE 0.026-0.057) and stable $R^2$ scores across horizons and context lengths, outperforming or matching fully trained deep learning baselines such as GRU and LSTM. Inference latency remains under 0.05s per 100 points on a single MacBook Pro using CPU-only computation, confirming deployability without dedicated GPU or MPS acceleration. These findings highlight the potential of pretrained TSFMs to enable scalable, efficient, and training-free forecasting for modern network monitoring and management systems.</p></details> |  |

Traffic was captured using Wireshark, and key metrics (including delay, jitter, bandwidth, and packet loss) were analyzed. Google Drive maintained the most consistent performance across both types of networks, showing low latency and reduced jitter. Dropbox showed efficient bandwidth utilization, but experienced a longer delay over LTE, attributed to a greater number of intermediate hops. OneDrive presented variable behavior, with elevated packet rates and increased sensitivity to fluctuations in the mobile network. A bimodal distribution of packet sizes was observed and modeled using a dual Poisson function. In general, Wi-Fi connections provided greater stability for multimedia transfers, while LTE performance varied depending on platform-specific implementations. The results contribute to a better understanding of traffic behavior in cloud-based storage applications and suggest further analysis with larger datasets and heterogeneous access networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 20th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies (CISTI), Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems</p></details> |

The dataset provides a unique view into global threat activity as observed through scanning and backscatter traffic, key indicators of large-scale probing behavior, data outages, and ongoing denial-of-service (DoS) campaigns. To process this extensive archive, coarse-to-fine methodology is adopted in which general insights are first extracted through a resource-efficient metadata sub-pipeline, followed by a more detailed packet header sub-pipeline for finer-grained analysis. The methodology establishes two sub-pipelines to enable scalable processing of nearly two decades of telescope data and supports multi-level exploration of traffic dynamics. Initial insights highlight long-term trends and recurring traffic spikes, some attributable to Internet-wide scanning events and others likely linked to DoS activities.We present general observations spanning 2006-2024, with a focused analysis of traffic characteristics during 2024.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue a comprehensive methodology is designed to optimize traffic flow and minimize delays. The framework is structured with three primary components: (a) vehicle detection, (b) traffic prediction, and (c) traffic signal optimization. This paper presents the first component, vehicle detection. The methodology involves analyzing multiple sequential frames from a camera feed to compute the background, i.e. the underlying roadway, by averaging pixel values over time. The computed background is then utilized to extract the foreground, where the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is applied to detect vehicles. With its computational efficiency and minimal infrastructure modification requirements, the proposed methodology offers a practical and scalable solution for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

Nonstabilizerness is a fundamental resource for quantum advantage, and efficient SRE estimations are highly beneficial in practical applications. We address the nonstabilizerness estimation problem through three supervised learning formulations starting from easier classification tasks to the more challenging regression task. Experimental results show that the proposed GNN manages to capture meaningful features from the graph-based circuit representation, resulting in robust generalization performances achieved across diverse scenarios. In classification tasks, the GNN is trained on product states and generalizes on circuits evolved under Clifford operations, entangled states, and circuits with higher number of qubits. In the regression task, the GNN significantly improves the SRE estimation on out-of-distribution circuits with higher number of qubits and gate counts compared to previous work, for both random quantum circuits and structured circuits derived from the transverse-field Ising model. Moreover, the graph representation of quantum circuits naturally integrates hardware-specific information. Simulations on noisy quantum hardware highlight the potential of the proposed GNN to predict the SRE measured on quantum devices.</p></details> |  |

The challenge of efficiently mapping application components to virtual machines (VMs) across diverse VM Offers from Cloud Providers is formalized as a constrained optimization problem (COP), considering both general and application-specific constraints. Due to the NP-hard nature and scalability limitations of exact solvers, we introduce a machine learning-enhanced approach where graph neural networks (GNNs) are trained on small-scale deployment instances and their predictions are used as soft constraints within the Z3 SMT solver. The deployment problem is recast as a graph edge classification task over a heterogeneous graph, combining relational embeddings with constraint reasoning. Our framework is validated through several realistic case studies, each highlighting different constraint profiles. Experimental results confirm that incorporating GNN predictions improves solver scalability and often preserves or even improves cost-optimality. This work demonstrates the practical benefits of neuro-symbolic coupling for Cloud infrastructure planning and contributes a reusable methodology for general NP-hard problems.</p></details> |  |

We introduce ARM-Explainer, a post-hoc, model-level explainer based on association rule mining, and demonstrate it on the predictions of the hybrid geometric scattering (HGS) GNN for the maximum clique problem (MCP), a canonical NP-hard graph-based COP. The eight most explanatory association rules discovered by ARM-Explainer achieve high median lift and confidence values of 2.42 and 0.49, respectively, on test instances from the TWITTER and BHOSLIB-DIMACS benchmark datasets. ARM-Explainer identifies the most important node features, together with their value ranges, that influence the GNN's predictions on these datasets. Furthermore, augmenting the GNN with informative node features substantially improves its performance on the MCP, increasing the median largest-found clique size by 22% (from 29.5 to 36) on large graphs from the BHOSLIB-DIMACS dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intelligent Neural Networks: From Layered Architectures to Graph-Organized Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22813v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biological neurons exhibit remarkable intelligence: they maintain internal states, communicate selectively with other neurons, and self-organize into complex graphs rather than rigid hierarchical layers. What if artificial intelligence could emerge from similarly intelligent computational units? We introduce Intelligent Neural Networks (INN), a paradigm shift where neurons are first-class entities with internal memory and learned communication patterns, organized in complete graphs rather than sequential layers. Each Intelligent Neuron combines selective state-space dynamics (knowing when to activate) with attention-based routing (knowing to whom to send signals), enabling emergent computation through graph-structured interactions. On the standard Text8 character modeling benchmark, INN achieves 1.705 Bit-Per-Character (BPC), significantly outperforming a comparable Transformer (2.055 BPC) and matching a highly optimized LSTM baseline. Crucially, a parameter-matched baseline of stacked Mamba blocks fails to converge (>3.4 BPC) under the same training protocol, demonstrating that INN's graph topology provides essential training stability. Ablation studies confirm this: removing inter-neuron communication degrades performance or leads to instability, proving the value of learned neural routing. This work demonstrates that neuron-centric design with graph organization is not merely bio-inspired -- it is computationally effective, opening new directions for modular, interpretable, and scalable neural architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/AntoineSal/IntelligentNeuralNetwork</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Ensembles: Simulating All-Atom Protein Dynamics in a Learned Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02196v4)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating the long-timescale dynamics of biomolecules is a central challenge in computational science. While enhanced sampling methods can accelerate these simulations, they rely on pre-defined collective variables that are often difficult to identify, restricting their ability to model complex switching mechanisms between metastable states. A recent generative model, LD-FPG, demonstrated that this problem could be bypassed by learning to sample the static equilibrium ensemble as all-atom deformations from a reference structure, establishing a powerful method for all-atom ensemble generation. However, while this approach successfully captures a system's probable conformations, it does not model the temporal evolution between them. We introduce the Graph Latent Dynamics Propagator (GLDP), a modular component for simulating dynamics within the learned latent space of LD-FPG. We then compare three classes of propagators: (i) score-guided Langevin dynamics, (ii) Koopman-based linear operators, and (iii) autoregressive neural networks. Within a unified encoder-propagator-decoder framework, we evaluate long-horizon stability, backbone and side-chain ensemble fidelity, and temporal kinetics via TICA. Benchmarks on systems ranging from small peptides to mixed-topology proteins and large GPCRs reveal that autoregressive neural networks deliver the most robust long rollouts and coherent physical timescales; score-guided Langevin best recovers side-chain thermodynamics when the score is well learned; and Koopman provides an interpretable, lightweight baseline that tends to damp fluctuations. These results clarify the trade-offs among propagators and offer practical guidance for latent-space simulators of all-atom protein dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Particle Dynamics Subject to Rigid Body Manipulations Using Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03446v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating particle dynamics with high fidelity is crucial for solving real-world interaction and control tasks involving liquids in design, graphics, and robotics. Recently, data-driven approaches, particularly those based on graph neural networks (GNNs), have shown progress in tackling such problems. However, these approaches are often limited to learning fluid behavior in static free-fall environments or simple manipulation settings involving primitive objects, often overlooking complex interactions with dynamically moving kinematic rigid bodies. Here, we propose a GNN-based framework designed from the ground up to learn the dynamics of liquids under rigid body interactions and active manipulations, where particles are represented as graph nodes and particle-object collisions are handled using surface representations with the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) algorithm. Our approach accurately captures fluid behavior in dynamic settings and can also function as a simulator in static free-fall environments. Despite being trained on single-object manipulation tasks, our model generalizes effectively to environments with novel objects and novel manipulation tasks. Finally, we show that the learned dynamics can be leveraged to solve control and manipulation tasks using gradient-based optimization methods.</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become mainstream for social bot detection due to their ability to integrate structural and attribute features, with spectral-based approaches demonstrating particular efficacy due to discriminative patterns in the spectral domain. However, current spectral GNN methods face two limitations: (1) their broad-spectrum fitting mechanisms degrade the focus on bot-specific spectral features, and (2) certain domain knowledge valuable for bot detection, e.g., low homophily correlates with high-frequency features, has not been fully incorporated into existing methods. To address these challenges, we propose HW-GNN, a novel homophily-aware graph spectral network with Gaussian window constraints. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (i) a Gaussian-window constrained spectral network that employs learnable Gaussian windows to highlight bot-related spectral features, and (ii) a homophily-aware adaptation mechanism that injects domain knowledge between homophily ratios and frequency features into the Gaussian window optimization process. Through extensive experimentation on multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that HW-GNN achieves state-of-the-art bot detection performance, outperforming existing methods with an average improvement of 4.3% in F1-score, while exhibiting strong plug-in compatibility with existing spectral GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interactive Query Answering on Knowledge Graphs with Soft Entity Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13663v3)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Methods for query answering over incomplete knowledge graphs retrieve entities that are \emph{likely} to be answers, which is particularly useful when such answers cannot be reached by direct graph traversal due to missing edges. However, existing approaches have focused on queries formalized using first-order-logic. In practice, many real-world queries involve constraints that are inherently vague or context-dependent, such as preferences for attributes or related categories. Addressing this gap, we introduce the problem of query answering with soft constraints. We formalize the problem and introduce two efficient methods designed to adjust query answer scores by incorporating soft constraints without disrupting the original answers to a query. These methods are lightweight, requiring tuning only two parameters or a small neural network trained to capture soft constraints while maintaining the original ranking structure. To evaluate the task, we extend existing QA benchmarks by generating datasets with soft constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that our methods can capture soft constraints while maintaining robust query answering performance and adding very little overhead. With our work, we explore a new and flexible way to interact with graph databases that allows users to specify their preferences by providing examples interactively.</p></details> |  |
| **[RELiQ: Scalable Entanglement Routing via Reinforcement Learning in Quantum Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22321v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum networks are becoming increasingly important because of advancements in quantum computing and quantum sensing, such as recent developments in distributed quantum computing and federated quantum machine learning. Routing entanglement in quantum networks poses several fundamental as well as technical challenges, including the high dynamicity of quantum network links and the probabilistic nature of quantum operations. Consequently, designing hand-crafted heuristics is difficult and often leads to suboptimal performance, especially if global network topology information is unavailable. In this paper, we propose RELiQ, a reinforcement learning-based approach to entanglement routing that only relies on local information and iterative message exchange. Utilizing a graph neural network, RELiQ learns graph representations and avoids overfitting to specific network topologies - a prevalent issue for learning-based approaches. Our approach, trained on random graphs, consistently outperforms existing local information heuristics and learning-based approaches when applied to random and real-world topologies. When compared to global information heuristics, our method achieves similar or superior performance because of its rapid response to topology changes.</p></details> |  |

A new measure, value-linked credit exposure between protocols, is defined as the inferred financial dependency relationships derived from changes in Total Value Locked (TVL). We develop a token-to-protocol model using DefiLlama metadata to infer inter-protocol credit exposure from the token's stock dynamics, as reported by the protocols. Based on the curated dataset, we develop three benchmarks for machine learning research with financial applications: (1) graph clustering for global network measurement, tracking the structural evolution of credit exposure networks, (2) vector autoregression for sector-level credit exposure dynamics during major shocks (Terra and FTX), and (3) temporal graph neural networks for dynamic link prediction on temporal graphs. From the analysis, we observe (1) a rapid growth of network volume, (2) a trend of concentration to key protocols, (3) a decline of network density (the ratio of actual connections to possible connections), and (4) distinct shock propagation across sectors, such as lending platforms, trading exchanges, and asset management protocols. The DeXposure dataset and code have been released publicly. We envision they will help with research and practice in machine learning as well as financial risk monitoring, policy analysis, DeFi market modeling, amongst others. The dataset also contributes to machine learning research by offering benchmarks for graph clustering, vector autoregression, and temporal graph analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Data ...</summary><p>Data and code: https://github.com/dthinkr/DeXposure - Visualisation: https://ccaf.io/defi/ecosystem-map/visualisation/graph</p></details> |

Previous studies predominantly rely on pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to learn facial appearance representations, overlooking the relationships between facial regions. To address this issue, this paper presents an Appearance- and Relation-aware Parallel Graph attention fusion Network (ARPGNet) to learn mutually enhanced spatial-temporal representations of appearance and relation information. Specifically, we construct a facial region relation graph and leverage the graph attention mechanism to model the relationships between facial regions. The resulting relational representation sequences, along with CNN-based appearance representation sequences, are then fed into a parallel graph attention fusion module for mutual interaction and enhancement. This module simultaneously explores the complementarity between different representation sequences and the temporal dynamics within each sequence. Experimental results on three facial expression recognition datasets demonstrate that the proposed ARPGNet outperforms or is comparable to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing.

This paper presents a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model, incorporating Chebyshev Spectral Graph Convolution and Graph Attention Networks (GAT), to increase the classification accuracy of ASD utilizing multimodal neuroimaging and phenotypic data. Leveraging the ABIDE I dataset, which contains resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), structural MRI (sMRI), and phenotypic variables from 870 patients, the model leverages a multi-branch architecture that processes each modality individually before merging them via concatenation. Graph structure is encoded using site-based similarity to generate a population graph, which helps in understanding relationship connections across individuals. Chebyshev polynomial filters provide localized spectral learning with lower computational complexity, whereas GAT layers increase node representations by attention-weighted aggregation of surrounding information. The proposed model is trained using stratified five-fold cross-validation with a total input dimension of 5,206 features per individual. Extensive trials demonstrate the enhanced model's superiority, achieving a test accuracy of 74.82\% and an AUC of 0.82 on the entire dataset, surpassing multiple state-of-the-art baselines, including conventional GCNs, autoencoder-based deep neural networks, and multimodal CNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables, Accepted and presented at Image and Vision Computing New Zealand (IVCNZ) 2025</p></details> |
| **[ARES: Anomaly Recognition Model For Edge Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22078v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world scenarios involving streaming information can be represented as temporal graphs, where data flows through dynamic changes in edges over time. Anomaly detection in this context has the objective of identifying unusual temporal connections within the graph structure. Detecting edge anomalies in real time is crucial for mitigating potential risks. Unlike traditional anomaly detection, this task is particularly challenging due to concept drifts, large data volumes, and the need for real-time response. To face these challenges, we introduce ARES, an unsupervised anomaly detection framework for edge streams. ARES combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for feature extraction with Half-Space Trees (HST) for anomaly scoring. GNNs capture both spike and burst anomalous behaviors within streams by embedding node and edge properties in a latent space, while HST partitions this space to isolate anomalies efficiently. ARES operates in an unsupervised way without the need for prior data labeling. To further validate its detection capabilities, we additionally incorporate a simple yet effective supervised thresholding mechanism. This approach leverages statistical dispersion among anomaly scores to determine the optimal threshold using a minimal set of labeled data, ensuring adaptability across different domains. We validate ARES through extensive evaluations across several real-world cyber-attack scenarios, comparing its performance against existing methods while analyzing its space and time complexity.</p></details> | Accepted at KDD 2026 |

Existing forecasting methods, particularly those based on graph neural networks, are often limited to modeling pairwise relationships between stations, failing to capture the complex, group-wise dynamics inherent in urban charging networks. To address this gap, we develop a novel forecasting framework namely HyperCast, leveraging the expressive power of hypergraphs to model the higher-order spatiotemporal dependencies hidden in EV charging patterns. HyperCast integrates multi-view hypergraphs, which capture both static geographical proximity and dynamic demand-based functional similarities, along with multi-timescale inputs to differentiate between recent trends and weekly periodicities. The framework employs specialized hyper-spatiotemporal blocks and tailored cross-attention mechanisms to effectively fuse information from these diverse sources: views and timescales. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that HyperCast significantly outperforms a wide array of state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of explicitly modeling collective charging behaviors for more accurate forecasting.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Leveraging them for predictive modeling can be impactful for timely identification of chronic diseases. However, they present core natural language processing (NLP) challenges: long text, irregular event distribution, complex temporal dependencies, privacy constraints, and resource limitations. We present two complementary methods for temporally and contextually grounded risk prediction from longitudinal notes. First, we introduce HiTGNN, a hierarchical temporal graph neural network that integrates intra-note temporal event structures, inter-visit dynamics, and medical knowledge to model patient trajectories with fine-grained temporal granularity. Second, we propose ReVeAL, a lightweight, test-time framework that distills the reasoning of large language models into smaller verifier models. Applied to opportunistic screening for Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) using temporally realistic cohorts curated from private and public hospital corpora, HiTGNN achieves the highest predictive accuracy, especially for near-term risk, while preserving privacy and limiting reliance on large proprietary models. ReVeAL enhances sensitivity to true T2D cases and retains explanatory reasoning. Our ablations confirm the value of temporal structure and knowledge augmentation, and fairness analysis shows HiTGNN performs more equitably across subgroups.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Efficient Training of Graph Neural Networks: A Multiscale Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19666v5)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become powerful tools for learning from graph-structured data, finding applications across diverse domains. However, as graph sizes and connectivity increase, standard GNN training methods face significant computational and memory challenges, limiting their scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we present a novel framework for efficient multiscale training of GNNs. Our approach leverages hierarchical graph representations and subgraphs, enabling the integration of information across multiple scales and resolutions. By utilizing coarser graph abstractions and subgraphs, each with fewer nodes and edges, we significantly reduce computational overhead during training. Building on this framework, we propose a suite of scalable training strategies, including coarse-to-fine learning, subgraph-to-full-graph transfer, and multiscale gradient computation. We also provide some theoretical analysis of our methods and demonstrate their effectiveness across various datasets and learning tasks. Our results show that multiscale training can substantially accelerate GNN training for large scale problems while maintaining, or even improving, predictive performance.</p></details> |  |

While graph neural networks (GNNs) have advanced molecular property prediction, they often rely on molecular topology and neglect the three-dimensional geometric information crucial for modeling transport mechanisms. This paper introduces the geometric multi-color message-passing graph neural network (GMC-MPNN), a novel framework that enhances standard message-passing architectures by explicitly incorporating atomic-level geometric features and long-range interactions. Our model constructs weighted colored subgraphs based on atom types to capture the spatial relationships and chemical context that govern BBB permeability. We evaluated GMC-MPNN on three benchmark datasets for both classification and regression tasks, using rigorous scaffold-based splitting to ensure a robust assessment of generalization. The results demonstrate that GMC-MPNN consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving superior performance in both classifying compounds as permeable/non-permeable (AUC-ROC of 0.9704 and 0.9685) and in regressing continuous permeability values (RMSE of 0.4609, Pearson correlation of 0.7759). An ablation study further quantified the impact of specific atom-pair interactions, revealing that the model's predictive power derives from its ability to learn from both common and rare, but chemically significant, functional motifs. By integrating spatial geometry into the graph representation, GMC-MPNN sets a new performance benchmark and offers a more accurate and generalizable tool for drug discovery pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is withdrawn due to an error in the training methodology that invalidates the results.

| **[Learning Individual Behavior in Agent-Based Models with Graph Diffusion Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21426v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agent-Based Models (ABMs) are powerful tools for studying emergent properties in complex systems. In ABMs, agent behaviors are governed by local interactions and stochastic rules. However, these rules are, in general, non-differentiable, limiting the use of gradient-based methods for optimization, and thus integration with real-world data. We propose a novel framework to learn a differentiable surrogate of any ABM by observing its generated data. Our method combines diffusion models to capture behavioral stochasticity and graph neural networks to model agent interactions. Distinct from prior surrogate approaches, our method introduces a fundamental shift: rather than approximating system-level outputs, it models individual agent behavior directly, preserving the decentralized, bottom-up dynamics that define ABMs. We validate our approach on two ABMs (Schelling's segregation model and a Predator-Prey ecosystem) showing that it replicates individual-level patterns and accurately forecasts emergent dynamics beyond training. Our results demonstrate the potential of combining diffusion models and graph learning for data-driven ABM simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Earth Observation Satellite Scheduling with Graph Neural Networks and Monte Carlo Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15041v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Earth Observation Satellite Planning (EOSP) is a difficult optimization problem with considerable practical interest. A set of requested observations must be scheduled on an agile Earth observation satellite while respecting constraints on their visibility window, as well as maneuver constraints that impose varying delays between successive observations. In addition, the problem is largely oversubscribed: there are much more candidate observations than can possibly be achieved. Therefore, one must select the set of observations that will be performed while maximizing their cumulative benefit and propose a feasible schedule for these observations. As previous work mostly focused on heuristic and iterative search algorithms, this paper presents a new technique for selecting and scheduling observations based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). GNNs are used to extract relevant information from the graphs representing instances of the EOSP, and DRL drives the search for optimal schedules. A post-learning search step based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is added that is able to find even better solutions. Experiments show that it is able to learn on small problem instances and generalize to larger real-world instances, with very competitive performance compared to traditional approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Workshop on Planning & Scheduling for Space (IWPSS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[MoEGCL: Mixture of Ego-Graphs Contrastive Representation Learning for Multi-View Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05876v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the advancement of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has significantly propelled progress in Multi-View Clustering (MVC). However, existing methods face the problem of coarse-grained graph fusion. Specifically, current approaches typically generate a separate graph structure for each view and then perform weighted fusion of graph structures at the view level, which is a relatively rough strategy. To address this limitation, we present a novel Mixture of Ego-Graphs Contrastive Representation Learning (MoEGCL). It mainly consists of two modules. In particular, we propose an innovative Mixture of Ego-Graphs Fusion (MoEGF), which constructs ego graphs and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts network to implement fine-grained fusion of ego graphs at the sample level, rather than the conventional view-level fusion. Additionally, we present the Ego Graph Contrastive Learning (EGCL) module to align the fused representation with the view-specific representation. The EGCL module enhances the representation similarity of samples from the same cluster, not merely from the same sample, further boosting fine-grained graph representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoEGCL achieves state-of-the-art results in deep multi-view clustering tasks.

While edge-based MPNNs effectively capture local interactions, their expressive power is theoretically bounded, limiting the discovery of higher-order relationships. We introduce the Higher-Order Graph Attention (HoGA) module, which constructs a k-order attention matrix by sampling subgraphs to maximize diversity among feature vectors. Unlike existing higher-order attention methods that greedily resample similar k-order relationships, HoGA targets diverse modalities in higher-order topology, reducing redundancy and expanding the range of captured substructures. Applied to two single-hop attention models, HoGA achieves at least a 5% accuracy gain on all benchmark node classification datasets and outperforms recent baselines on six of eight datasets.

| **[Representation Integrity in Temporal Graph Learning Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20873v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world systems ranging from airline routes to cryptocurrency transfers are naturally modelled as dynamic graphs whose topology changes over time. Conventional benchmarks judge dynamic-graph learners by a handful of task-specific scores, yet seldom ask whether the embeddings themselves remain a truthful, interpretable reflection of the evolving network. We formalize this requirement as representation integrity and derive a family of indexes that measure how closely embedding changes follow graph changes. Three synthetic scenarios, Gradual Merge, Abrupt Move, and Periodic Re-wiring, are used to screen forty-two candidate indexes. Based on which we recommend one index that passes all of our theoretical and empirical tests. In particular, this validated metric consistently ranks the provably stable UASE and IPP models highest. We then use this index to do a comparative study on representation integrity of common dynamic graph learning models. This study exposes the scenario-specific strengths of neural methods, and shows a strong positive rank correlation with one-step link-prediction AUC. The proposed integrity framework, therefore, offers a task-agnostic and interpretable evaluation tool for dynamic-graph representation quality, providing more explicit guidance for model selection and future architecture design.</p></details> | 70 pages |

However, most industrial deployments adopt a two-stage pipeline: GNNs are first pre-trained offline to generate node embeddings, which are then used as static features for downstream recommender systems. This decoupled paradigm leads to two key limitations: (1) high computational overhead, since large-scale GNN inference must be repeatedly executed to refresh embeddings; and (2) lack of joint optimization, as the gradient from the recommender system cannot directly influence the GNN learning process, causing the GNN to be suboptimally informative for the recommendation task. In this paper, we propose E2E-GRec, a novel end-to-end training framework that unifies GNN training with the recommender system. Our framework is characterized by three key components: (i) efficient subgraph sampling from a large-scale cross-domain heterogeneous graph to ensure training scalability and efficiency; (ii) a Graph Feature Auto-Encoder (GFAE) serving as an auxiliary self-supervised task to guide the GNN to learn structurally meaningful embeddings; and (iii) a two-level feature fusion mechanism combined with Gradnorm-based dynamic loss balancing, which stabilizes graph-aware multi-task end-to-end training. Extensive offline evaluations, online A/B tests (e.g., a +0.133% relative improvement in stay duration, a 0.3171% reduction in the average number of videos a user skips) on large-scale production data, together with theoretical analysis, demonstrate that E2E-GRec consistently surpasses traditional approaches, yielding significant gains across multiple recommendation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Short-Range Oversquashing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20406v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are widely used for learning on graphs, but their ability to process long-range information is limited by the phenomenon of oversquashing. This limitation has led some researchers to advocate Graph Transformers as a better alternative, whereas others suggest that it can be mitigated within the MPNN framework, using virtual nodes or other rewiring techniques. In this work, we demonstrate that oversquashing is not limited to long-range tasks, but can also arise in short-range problems. This observation allows us to disentangle two distinct mechanisms underlying oversquashing: (1) the bottleneck phenomenon, which can arise even in low-range settings, and (2) the vanishing gradient phenomenon, which is closely associated with long-range tasks. We further show that the short-range bottleneck effect is not captured by existing explanations for oversquashing, and that adding virtual nodes does not resolve it. In contrast, transformers do succeed in such tasks, positioning them as the more compelling solution to oversquashing, compared to specialized MPNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Learning on Graphs (LoG) 2025.

First, we formulate sum rate (SR) and energy efficiency (EE) maximization problems in a unified framework, subject to constraints on the movable region of PAs, total power budget, and tunable phase of RIS elements. Then, by leveraging a graph-structured topology of the RIS-assisted PASS, a novel three-stage graph neural network (GNN) is proposed, which learns PA positions based on user locations, and RIS phase shifts according to composite channel conditions at the first two stages, respectively, and finally determines beamforming vectors. Specifically, the proposed GNN is achieved through unsupervised training, together with three implementation strategies for its integration with convex optimization, thus offering trade-offs between inference time and solution optimality. Extensive numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed GNN, and to support its unique attributes of viable generalization capability, good performance reliability, and real-time applicability. Moreover, the impact of key parameters on RIS-assisted PASS is illustrated and analyzed.</p></details> |  |

They have been used to eliminate issues such as over-smoothing or over-squashing, to significantly enhance the accuracy of GNN predictions, to improve the expressiveness of GNN architectures, and for numerous other goals. A plethora of HOGNN models have been introduced, and they come with diverse neural architectures, and even with different notions of what the "higher-order" means. This richness makes it very challenging to appropriately analyze and compare HOGNN models, and to decide in what scenario to use specific ones. To alleviate this, we first design an in-depth taxonomy and a blueprint for HOGNNs. This facilitates designing models that maximize performance. Then, we use our taxonomy to analyze and compare the available HOGNN models. The outcomes of our analysis are synthesized in a set of insights that help to select the most beneficial GNN model in a given scenario, and a comprehensive list of challenges and opportunities for further research into more powerful HOGNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decoupling and Damping: Structurally-Regularized Gradient Matching for Multimodal Graph Condensation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20222v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In critical web applications such as e-commerce and recommendation systems, multimodal graphs integrating rich visual and textual attributes are increasingly central, yet their large scale introduces substantial computational burdens for training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). While Graph Condensation (GC) offers a promising solution by synthesizing smaller datasets, existing methods falter in the multimodal setting. We identify a dual challenge causing this failure: (1) conflicting gradients arising from semantic misalignments between modalities, and (2) the GNN's message-passing architecture pathologically amplifying this gradient noise across the graph structure. To address this, we propose Structurally-Regularized Gradient Matching (SR-GM), a novel condensation framework tailored for multimodal graphs. SR-GM introduces two synergistic components: first, a gradient decoupling mechanism that resolves inter-modality conflicts at their source via orthogonal projection; and second, a structural damping regularizer that acts directly on the gradient field. By leveraging the graph's Dirichlet energy, this regularizer transforms the topology from a noise amplifier into a stabilizing force during optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SR-GM significantly improves accuracy and accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods. Ablation studies confirm that addressing both gradient conflict and structural amplification in tandem is essential for achieving superior performance. Moreover, the condensed multimodal graphs exhibit strong cross-architecture generalization and promise to accelerate applications like Neural Architecture Search. This research provides a scalable methodology for multimodal graph-based learning in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>11pag...</summary><p>11pages,5 figures,6 tables</p></details> |

Unlike traditional pixel-based methods, each frame is represented as a scene graph and human nodes across frames are linked to a global root, forming the video-level graph and enabling cross-frame reasoning centered on human actors. The video-level graphs are then processed by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), transforming them into rich, context-aware embeddings for efficient processing. Finally, these embeddings are integrated with question features in a hierarchical network operating across different abstraction levels, enhancing both local and global understanding of video content. This explicit human-rooted structure enhances interpretability by decomposing actions into human-object interactions and enables a more profound understanding of spatiotemporal dynamics. We validate our approach on the Action Genome Question Answering (AGQA) dataset, achieving significant performance improvements, including a 7.3% improvement in object-relation reasoning over the state of the art.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Kernel Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07436v3)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The convolution operator at the core of many modern neural architectures can effectively be seen as performing a dot product between an input matrix and a filter. While this is readily applicable to data such as images, which can be represented as regular grids in the Euclidean space, extending the convolution operator to work on graphs proves more challenging, due to their irregular structure. In this paper, we propose to use graph kernels, i.e. kernel functions that compute an inner product on graphs, to extend the standard convolution operator to the graph domain. This allows us to define an entirely structural model that does not require computing the embedding of the input graph. Our architecture allows to plug-in any type of graph kernels and has the added benefit of providing some interpretability in terms of the structural masks that are learned during the training process, similarly to what happens for convolutional masks in traditional convolutional neural networks. We perform an extensive ablation study to investigate the model hyper-parameters' impact and show that our model achieves competitive performance on standard graph classification and regression datasets.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose the DDSM, a new MPNN model built on an optimization framework that includes the stress majorization and orthogonal regularization for overcoming the above issues. Further, we introduce the diffusion distances for nodes into the framework to guide the new message passing operations and develop efficient algorithms for distance approximations, both backed by rigorous theoretical analyses.

| **[Rethinking Semi-Supervised Node Classification with Self-Supervised Graph Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19976v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of graph neural networks (GNNs) has offered a powerful tool for semi-supervised node classification tasks. Subsequent studies have achieved further improvements through refining the message passing schemes in GNN models or exploiting various data augmentation techniques to mitigate limited supervision. In real graphs, nodes often tend to form tightly-knit communities/clusters, which embody abundant signals for compensating label scarcity in semi-supervised node classification but are not explored in prior methods. Inspired by this, this paper presents NCGC that integrates self-supervised graph clustering and semi-supervised classification into a unified framework. Firstly, we theoretically unify the optimization objectives of GNNs and spectral graph clustering, and based on that, develop soft orthogonal GNNs (SOGNs) that leverage a refined message passing paradigm to generate node representations for both classification and clustering. On top of that, NCGC includes a self-supervised graph clustering module that enables the training of SOGNs for learning representations of unlabeled nodes in a self-supervised manner. Particularly, this component comprises two non-trivial clustering objectives and a Sinkhorn-Knopp normalization that transforms predicted cluster assignments into balanced soft pseudo-labels. Through combining the foregoing clustering module with the classification model using a multi-task objective containing the supervised classification loss on labeled data and self-supervised clustering loss on unlabeled data, NCGC promotes synergy between them and achieves enhanced model capacity. Our extensive experiments showcase that the proposed NCGC framework consistently and considerably outperforms popular GNN models and recent baselines for semi-supervised node classification on seven real graphs, when working with various classic GNN backbones.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Recent advanced methods leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and contrastive learning to characterize the spatial structure of road segments in a self-supervised paradigm. However, spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics of road networks raise severe challenges to the neighborhood smoothing mechanism of self-supervised GNNs. To address these issues, we propose a $\textbf{D}$ual-branch $\textbf{S}$patial-$\textbf{T}$emporal self-supervised representation framework for enhanced road representations, termed as DST. On one hand, DST designs a mix-hop transition matrix for graph convolution to incorporate dynamic relations of roads from trajectories. Besides, DST contrasts road representations of the vanilla road network against that of the hypergraph in a spatial self-supervised way. The hypergraph is newly built based on three types of hyperedges to capture long-range relations. On the other hand, DST performs next token prediction as the temporal self-supervised task on the sequences of traffic dynamics based on a causal Transformer, which is further regularized by differentiating traffic modes of weekdays from those of weekends. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art methods verify the superiority of our proposed framework. Moreover, the comprehensive spatiotemporal modeling facilitates DST to excel in zero-shot learning scenarios.</p></details> | Accept by AAAI 2026 |
| **[SCNode: Spatial and Contextual Coordinates for Graph Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02158v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective node representation lies at the heart of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), as it directly impacts their ability to perform downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Most existing GNNs, particularly message passing graph neural networks, rely on neighborhood aggregation to iteratively compute node embeddings. While powerful, this paradigm suffers from well-known limitations of oversquashing, oversmoothing, and underreaching that degrade representation quality. More critically, MPGNNs often assume homophily, where connected nodes share similar features or labels, leading to poor generalization in heterophilic graphs where this assumption breaks down. To address these challenges, we propose \textit{SCNode}, a \textit{Spatial-Contextual Node Embedding} framework designed to perform consistently well in both homophilic and heterophilic settings. SCNode integrates spatial and contextual information, yielding node embeddings that are not only more discriminative but also structurally aware. Our approach introduces new homophily matrices for understanding class interactions and tendencies. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that SCNode achieves superior performance over conventional GNN models, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability in diverse graph structures.</p></details> | 24 pages, 5 figures |
| **[GED-Consistent Disentanglement of Aligned and Unaligned Substructures for Graph Similarity Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19837v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Similarity Computation (GSC) is a fundamental graph related task where Graph Edit Distance (GED) serves as a prevalent metric. GED is determined by an optimal alignment between a pair of graphs that partitions each into aligned (zero-cost) and unaligned (cost-incurring) substructures. Due to NP-hard nature of exact GED computation, GED approximations based on Graph Neural Network(GNN) have emerged. Existing GNN-based GED approaches typically learn node embeddings for each graph and then aggregate pairwise node similarities to estimate the final similarity. Despite their effectiveness, we identify a mismatch between this prevalent node-centric matching paradigm and the core principles of GED. This discrepancy leads to two critical limitations: (1) a failure to capture the global structural correspondence for optimal alignment, and (2) a misattribution of edit costs driven by spurious node level signals. To address these limitations, we propose GCGSim, a GED-consistent graph similarity learning framework centering on graph-level matching and substructure-level edit costs. Specifically, we make three core technical contributions. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that GCGSim achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our comprehensive analyses further validate that the framework effectively learns disentangled and semantically meaningful substructure representations.</p></details> |  |

However, developing reliable machine learning (ML) models for AD diagnosis is challenging due to limited labeled data, multi-site heterogeneity, and class imbalance. We propose a Transformer-based diagnostic framework that combines diffusion-based synthetic data generation with graph representation learning and transfer learning. A class-conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is trained on the real-world NACC dataset to generate a large synthetic cohort that mirrors multimodal clinical and neuroimaging feature distributions while balancing diagnostic classes. Modality-specific Graph Transformer encoders are first pretrained on this synthetic data to learn robust, class-discriminative representations and are then frozen while a neural classifier is trained on embeddings from the original NACC data. We quantify distributional alignment between real and synthetic cohorts using metrics such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Frechet distance, and energy distance, and complement discrimination metrics with calibration and fixed-specificity sensitivity analyses. Empirically, our framework outperforms standard baselines, including early and late fusion deep neural networks and the multimodal graph-based model MaGNet, yielding higher AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity under subject-wise cross-validation on NACC. These results show that diffusion-based synthetic pretraining with Graph Transformers can improve generalization in low-sample, imbalanced clinical prediction settings.</p></details> | 14 pages.

| **[Sentence Smith: Controllable Edits for Evaluating Text Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14734v4)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable and transparent text generation has been a long-standing goal in NLP. Almost as long-standing is a general idea for addressing this challenge: Parsing text to a symbolic representation, and generating from it. However, earlier approaches were hindered by parsing and generation insufficiencies. Using modern parsers and a safety supervision mechanism, we show how close current methods come to this goal. Concretely, we propose the Sentence Smith framework for English, which has three steps: 1. Parsing a sentence into a semantic graph. 2. Applying human-designed semantic manipulation rules. 3. Generating text from the manipulated graph. A final entailment check (4.) verifies the validity of the applied transformation. To demonstrate our framework's utility, we use it to induce hard negative text pairs that challenge text embedding models. Since the controllable generation makes it possible to clearly isolate different types of semantic shifts, we can evaluate text embedding models in a fine-grained way, also addressing an issue in current benchmarking where linguistic phenomena remain opaque. Human validation confirms that our transparent generation process produces texts of good quality. Notably, our way of generation is very resource-efficient, since it relies only on smaller neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 (main), this version fixes a subscript typo in Eq 1</p></details> |
| **[Interpreting Graph Inference with Skyline Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07635v4)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference queries have been routinely issued to graph machine learning models such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for various network analytical tasks. Nevertheless, GNN outputs are often hard to interpret comprehensively. Existing methods typically conform to individual pre-defined explainability measures (such as fidelity), which often leads to biased, ``one-side'' interpretations. This paper introduces skyline explanation, a new paradigm that interprets GNN outputs by simultaneously optimizing multiple explainability measures of users' interests. (1) We propose skyline explanations as a Pareto set of explanatory subgraphs that dominate others over multiple explanatory measures. We formulate skyline explanation as a multi-criteria optimization problem, and establish its hardness results. (2) We design efficient algorithms with an onion-peeling approach, which strategically prioritizes nodes and removes unpromising edges to incrementally assemble skyline explanations. (3) We also develop an algorithm to diversify the skyline explanations to enrich the comprehensive interpretation. (4) We introduce efficient parallel algorithms with load-balancing strategies to scale skyline explanation for large-scale GNN-based inference. Using real-world and synthetic graphs, we experimentally verify our algorithms' effectiveness and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICDE 2026</p></details> |

Using weekly sales data from 45 Walmart stores, we construct a relational forecasting framework that models inter-store dependencies through a learned adaptive graph. The proposed STGNN predicts log-differenced sales and reconstructs final values through a residual path, enabling stable training and improved generalisation. Experiments show that STGNN achieves the lowest overall forecasting error, outperforming all baselines in Normalised Total Absolute Error, P90 MAPE, and variance of MAPE across stores. Analysis of the learned adjacency matrix reveals meaningful functional store clusters and high-influence nodes that emerge without geographic metadata. These results demonstrate that relational structure significantly improves forecast quality in interconnected retail environments and establishes STGNNs as a robust modelling choice for multi-store demand prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

However, their performance as multi-scale devices is determined by complex interactions between their constituent layers. This creates a vast combinatorial space of possible materials and device architectures, making the conventional experimental-based screening process slow and expensive. Machine learning models try to address this problem, but they only focus on individual material properties or neglect the important geometric information of the perovskite crystal. To address this problem, we propose to predict perovskite solar cell power conversion efficiency with a geometric-aware co-attention (Solar-GECO) model. Solar-GECO combines a geometric graph neural network (GNN) - that directly encodes the atomic structure of the perovskite absorber - with language model embeddings that process the textual strings representing the chemical compounds of the transport layers and other device components. Solar-GECO also integrates a co-attention module to capture intra-layer dependencies and inter-layer interactions, while a probabilistic regression head predicts both power conversion efficiency (PCE) and its associated uncertainty. Solar-GECO achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming several baselines, reducing the mean absolute error (MAE) for PCE prediction from 3.066 to 2.936 compared to semantic GNN (the previous state-of-the-art model). Solar-GECO demonstrates that integrating geometric and textual information provides a more powerful and accurate framework for PCE prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the AI for Accelerated Materials Design (AI4Mat) Workshop at NeurIPS 2025. 14 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Rapid cardiac activation prediction for cardiac resynchronization therapy planning using geometric deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08987v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a common intervention for patients with dyssynchronous heart failure, yet approximately one-third of recipients fail to respond due to multiple contributing factors, including suboptimal lead placement. Identifying optimal pacing sites remains challenging, largely due to patient-specific anatomical variability and the limitations of current individualized planning strategies. In a step towards constructing an in-silico approach to help address this issue, we develop two geometric deep learning (DL) models, based on graph neural network (GNN) and geometry-informed neural operator (GINO), to predict cardiac activation time maps in real time for CRT planning and optimization. Both models are trained on a large dataset generated from finite-element (FE) simulations over a wide range of synthetic left ventricular (LV) geometries, pacing site configurations, and tissue conductivities. In testing, the GINO model outperforms the GNN model on synthetic test data, with lower prediction errors (1.38% vs 2.44%), while both demonstrate comparable performance on real-world LV geometries (GINO: 4.79% vs GNN: 4.07%). Using the trained models, we also develop a workflow for optimizing the pacing site in CRT from a given activation time map and LV geometry. The trained DL models were capable of recovering the ground truth subject-specific parameters from the noisy activation time map with small errors. In conjunction with an interactive web-based graphical user interface (GUI) available at https://dcsim.egr.msu.edu/, this study shows promising potential as a clinical decision-support tool for personalized pre-procedural CRT optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphMind: Theorem Selection and Conclusion Generation Framework with Dynamic GNN for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19078v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, including multi-step reasoning such as mathematical proving. However, existing approaches often lack an explicit and dynamic mechanism to structurally represent and evolve intermediate reasoning states, which limits their ability to perform context-aware theorem selection and iterative conclusion generation. To address these challenges, we propose GraphMind, a novel dynamic graph-based framework that integrates the graph neural network (GNN) with LLMs to iteratively select theorems and generate intermediate conclusions for multi-step reasoning. Our method models the reasoning process as a heterogeneous evolving graph, where nodes represent conditions, theorems, and conclusions, while edges capture logical dependencies between nodes. By encoding the current reasoning state with GNN and leveraging semantic matching for theorem selection, our framework enables context-aware, interpretable, and structured reasoning in a closed-loop manner. Experiments on various question-answering (QA) datasets demonstrate that our proposed GraphMind method achieves consistent performance improvements and significantly outperforms existing baselines in multi-step reasoning, validating the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resolving Node Identifiability in Graph Neural Processes via Laplacian Spectral Encodings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19037v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message passing graph neural networks are widely used for learning on graphs, yet their expressive power is limited by the one-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman test and can fail to distinguish structurally different nodes. We provide rigorous theory for a Laplacian positional encoding that is invariant to eigenvector sign flips and to basis rotations within eigenspaces. We prove that this encoding yields node identifiability from a constant number of observations and establishes a sample-complexity separation from architectures constrained by the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. The analysis combines a monotone link between shortest-path and diffusion distance, spectral trilateration with a constant set of anchors, and quantitative spectral injectivity with logarithmic embedding size. As an instantiation, pairing this encoding with a neural-process style decoder yields significant gains on a drug-drug interaction task on chemical graphs, improving both the area under the ROC curve and the F1 score and demonstrating the practical benefits of resolving theoretical expressiveness limitations with principled positional information.</p></details> |  |

SplitGNN incorporates a co-training architecture consisting of supervised message passing mech anism and unsupervised solution boosting layer. A new graph representation called edge-splitting factor graph is proposed to provide more structural information for learning, which is based on spanning tree generation and edge classification. To improve the solutions on challenging and weighted instances, we implement a GPU-accelerated layer applying efficient score calculation and relaxation-based optimization. Exper iments show that SplitGNN achieves 3* faster convergence and better predictions compared with other GNN-based ar chitectures. More notably, SplitGNN successfully finds solu tions that outperform modern heuristic MaxSAT solvers on much larger and harder weighted MaxSAT benchmarks, and demonstrates exceptional generalization abilities on diverse structural instances.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Interpretability of Graph Neural Networks to Assess Effects of Global Change Drivers on Ecological Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15107v3)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pollinators play a crucial role for plant reproduction, either in natural ecosystem or in human-modified landscape. Global change drivers,including climate change or land use modifications, can alter the plant-pollinator interactions. To assess the potential influence of global change drivers on pollination, large-scale interactions, climate and land use data are required. While recent machine learning methods, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), allow the analysis of such datasets, interpreting their results can be challenging. We explore existing methods for interpreting GNNs in order to highlight the effects of various environmental covariates on pollination network connectivity. An extensive simulation study is performed to confirm whether these methods can detect the interactive effect between a covariate and a genus of plant on connectivity, and whether the application of debiasing techniques influences the estimation of these effects. An application on the Spipoll dataset, with and without accounting for sampling effects, highlights the potential impact of land use on network connectivity and shows that accounting for sampling effects partially alters the estimation of these effects.</p></details> |  |

Simulating HAT is challenging due to the need for quantum chemical accuracy at biologically relevant scales; thus, neither classical force fields nor DFT-based molecular dynamics are applicable. Machine-learned potentials offer an alternative, able to learn potential energy surfaces (PESs) with near-quantum accuracy. However, training these models to generalize across diverse HAT configurations, especially at radical positions in proteins, requires tailored data generation and careful model selection. Here, we systematically generate HAT configurations in peptides to build large datasets using semiempirical methods and DFT. We benchmark three graph neural network architectures (SchNet, Allegro, and MACE) on their ability to learn HAT PESs and indirectly predict reaction barriers from energy predictions. MACE consistently outperforms the others in energy, force, and barrier prediction, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.13 kcal/mol on out-of-distribution DFT barrier predictions. Using molecular dynamics, we show our MACE potential is stable, reactive, and generalizes beyond training data to model HAT barriers in collagen I. This accuracy enables integration of ML potentials into large-scale collagen simulations to compute reaction rates from predicted barriers, advancing mechanistic understanding of HAT and radical migration in peptides. We analyze scaling laws, model transferability, and cost-performance trade-offs, and outline strategies for improvement by combining ML potentials with transition state search algorithms and active learning. Our approach is generalizable to other biomolecular systems, enabling quantum-accurate simulations of chemical reactivity in complex environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 12 figures, and 4 tables (references and SI included)</p></details> |

Existing methods typically extract unified features to process all actions in one video, which makes it challenging to model the interactions between different objects in multi-action scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we explore disentangling any specified actions from complex scenes as an effective solution. In this paper, we propose Prompt-guided Disentangled Representation for Action Recognition (ProDA), a novel framework that disentangles any specified actions from a multi-action scene. ProDA leverages Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs) and introduces Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. Furthermore, we design a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights. Experiments in video action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach when compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

Building on our earlier work on graph convolutional network hypermodels, HGNN(O) extends four architectures-One Level, Two Level, Two Level Pseudo Embedding, and Two Level Embedding-across six canonical GNN operators. A self-tuning mechanism based on Bayesian optimization with pruning and early stopping enables efficient adaptation over architectures and hyperparameters without manual configuration. Empirical evaluation on both balanced and imbalanced event logs shows that HGNN(O) achieves accuracy exceeding 0.98 on the Traffic Fines dataset and weighted F1 scores up to 0.86 on the Patients dataset without explicit imbalance handling. These results demonstrate that the proposed AutoML-GNN approach provides a robust and generalizable benchmark for outcome prediction in complex event-sequence data.</p></details> | 6 pages |

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are well suited to capture structural dependencies in process data, existing GNN-based PBPM models remain underdeveloped. Most rely either on short prefix subgraphs or global architectures that overlook temporal relevance and transition semantics. We propose a unified, interpretable GNN framework that advances the state of the art along three key axes. First, we compare prefix-based Graph Convolutional Networks(GCNs) and full trace Graph Attention Networks(GATs) to quantify the performance gap between localized and global modeling. Second, we introduce a novel time decay attention mechanism that constructs dynamic, prediction-centered windows, emphasizing temporally relevant history and suppressing noise. Third, we embed transition type semantics into edge features to enable fine grained reasoning over structurally ambiguous traces. Our architecture includes multilevel interpretability modules, offering diverse visualizations of attention behavior. Evaluated on five benchmarks, the proposed models achieve competitive Top-k accuracy and DL scores without per-dataset tuning. By addressing architectural, temporal, and semantic gaps, this work presents a robust, generalizable, and explainable solution for next event prediction in PBPM.</p></details> | 42 pages |
| **[Hypergraph Contrastive Learning for both Homophilic and Heterophilic Hypergraphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18783v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hypergraphs, as a generalization of traditional graphs, naturally capture high-order relationships. In recent years, hypergraph neural networks (HNNs) have been widely used to capture complex high-order relationships. However, most existing hypergraph neural network methods inherently rely on the homophily assumption, which often does not hold in real-world scenarios that exhibit significant heterophilic structures. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{HONOR}, a novel unsupervised \textbf{H}ypergraph c\textbf{ON}trastive learning framework suitable for both hom\textbf{O}philic and hete\textbf{R}ophilic hypergraphs. Specifically, HONOR explicitly models the heterophilic relationships between hyperedges and nodes through two complementary mechanisms: a prompt-based hyperedge feature construction strategy that maintains global semantic consistency while suppressing local noise, and an adaptive attention aggregation module that dynamically captures the diverse local contributions of nodes to hyperedges. Combined with high-pass filtering, these designs enable HONOR to fully exploit heterophilic connection patterns, yielding more discriminative and robust node and hyperedge representations. Theoretically, we demonstrate the superior generalization ability and robustness of HONOR. Empirically, extensive experiments further validate that HONOR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under both homophilic and heterophilic datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pilot Contamination-Aware Graph Attention Network for Power Control in CFmMIMO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00967v4)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization-based power control algorithms are predominantly iterative with high computational complexity, making them impractical for real-time applications in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) systems. Learning-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative, and among them, graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their excellent performance in solving power control problems. However, all existing GNN-based approaches assume ideal orthogonality among pilot sequences for user equipments (UEs), which is unrealistic given that the number of UEs exceeds the available orthogonal pilot sequences in CFmMIMO schemes. Moreover, most learning-based methods assume a fixed number of UEs, whereas the number of active UEs varies over time in practice. Additionally, supervised training necessitates costly computational resources for computing the target power control solutions for a large volume of training samples. To address these issues, we propose a graph attention network for downlink power control in CFmMIMO systems that operates in a self-supervised manner while effectively handling pilot contamination and adapting to a dynamic number of UEs. Experimental results show its effectiveness, even in comparison to the optimal accelerated projected gradient method as a baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[CycleChemist: A Dual-Pronged Machine Learning Framework for Organic Photovoltaic Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19500v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials offer a promising path toward sustainable energy generation, but their development is limited by the difficulty of identifying high performance donor and acceptor pairs with strong power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Existing design strategies typically focus on either the donor or the acceptor alone, rather than using a unified approach capable of modeling both components. In this work, we introduce a dual machine learning framework for OPV discovery that combines predictive modeling with generative molecular design. We present the Organic Photovoltaic Donor Acceptor Dataset (OPV2D), the largest curated dataset of its kind, containing 2000 experimentally characterized donor acceptor pairs. Using this dataset, we develop the Organic Photovoltaic Classifier (OPVC) to predict whether a material exhibits OPV behavior, and a hierarchical graph neural network that incorporates multi task learning and donor acceptor interaction modeling. This framework includes the Molecular Orbital Energy Estimator (MOE2) for predicting HOMO and LUMO energy levels, and the Photovoltaic Performance Predictor (P3) for estimating PCE. In addition, we introduce the Material Generative Pretrained Transformer (MatGPT) to produce synthetically accessible organic semiconductors, guided by a reinforcement learning strategy with three objective policy optimization. By linking molecular representation learning with performance prediction, our framework advances data driven discovery of high performance OPV materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Mesh-Quantization for Neural PDE Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18474v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical systems commonly exhibit spatially varying complexity, presenting a significant challenge for neural PDE solvers. While Graph Neural Networks can handle the irregular meshes required for complex geometries and boundary conditions, they still apply uniform computational effort across all nodes regardless of the underlying physics complexity. This leads to inefficient resource allocation where computationally simple regions receive the same treatment as complex phenomena. We address this challenge by introducing Adaptive Mesh Quantization: spatially adaptive quantization across mesh node, edge, and cluster features, dynamically adjusting the bit-width used by a quantized model. We propose an adaptive bit-width allocation strategy driven by a lightweight auxiliary model that identifies high-loss regions in the input mesh. This enables dynamic resource distribution in the main model, where regions of higher difficulty are allocated increased bit-width, optimizing computational resource utilization. We demonstrate our framework's effectiveness by integrating it with two state-of-the-art models, MP-PDE and GraphViT, to evaluate performance across multiple tasks: 2D Darcy flow, large-scale unsteady fluid dynamics in 2D, steady-state Navier-Stokes simulations in 3D, and a 2D hyper-elasticity problem. Our framework demonstrates consistent Pareto improvements over uniformly quantized baselines, yielding up to 50% improvements in performance at the same cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learn from Global Correlations: Enhancing Evolutionary Algorithm via Spectral GNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17629v5)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) simulate natural selection but have two main limitations: (1) they rarely update individuals based on global correlations, limiting comprehensive learning; (2) they struggle with balancing exploration and exploitation, where excessive exploitation causes premature convergence, and excessive exploration slows down the search. Moreover, EAs often depend on manual parameter settings, which can disrupt the exploration-exploitation balance. To address these issues, we propose Graph Neural Evolution (GNE), a novel EA framework. GNE represents the population as a graph, where nodes represent individuals, and edges capture their relationships, enabling global information usage. GNE utilizes spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) to decompose evolutionary signals into frequency components, applying a filtering function to fuse these components. High-frequency components capture diverse global information, while low-frequency ones capture more consistent information. This explicit frequency filtering strategy directly controls global-scale features through frequency components, overcoming the limitations of manual parameter settings and making the exploration-exploitation control more interpretable and manageable. Tests on nine benchmark functions (e.g., Sphere, Rastrigin, Rosenbrock) show that GNE outperforms classical (GA, DE, CMA-ES) and advanced algorithms (SDAES, RL-SHADE) under various conditions, including noise-corrupted and optimal solution deviation scenarios. GNE achieves solutions several orders of magnitude better (e.g., 3.07e-20 mean on Sphere vs. 1.51e-07).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 40th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

Equivariance is formulated as naturality in a topological category with Radon measures, formulating linear and nonlinear layers in the categorical setup. We prove the equivariant universal approximation theorem in the general setting: the class of finite-depth CENNs is dense in the space of continuous equivariant transformations. We instantiate the framework for groups/groupoids, posets/lattices, graphs and cellular sheaves, deriving universal approximation theorems for them in a systematic manner. Categorical equivariant deep learning thus allows us to expand the horizons of equivariant deep learning beyond group actions, encompassing not only geometric symmetries but also contextual and compositional symmetries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pre-training Graph Neural Networks on 2D and 3D Molecular Structures by using Multi-View Conditional Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18404v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent pre-training strategies for molecular graphs have attempted to use 2D and 3D molecular views as both inputs and self-supervised signals, primarily aligning graph-level representations. However, existing studies remain limited in addressing two main challenges of multi-view molecular learning: (1) discovering shared information between two views while diminishing view-specific information and (2) identifying and aligning important substructures, e.g., functional groups, which are crucial for enhancing cross-view consistency and model expressiveness. To solve these challenges, we propose a Multi-View Conditional Information Bottleneck framework, called MVCIB, for pre-training graph neural networks on 2D and 3D molecular structures in a self-supervised setting. Our idea is to discover the shared information while minimizing irrelevant features from each view under the MVCIB principle, which uses one view as a contextual condition to guide the representation learning of its counterpart. To enhance semantic and structural consistency across views, we utilize key substructures, e.g., functional groups and ego-networks, as anchors between the two views. Then, we propose a cross-attention mechanism that captures fine-grained correlations between the substructures to achieve subgraph alignment across views. Extensive experiments in four molecular domains demonstrated that MVCIB consistently outperforms baselines in both predictive performance and interpretability. Moreover, MVCIB achieved the 3d Weisfeiler-Lehman expressiveness power to distinguish not only non-isomorphic graphs but also different 3D geometries that share identical 2D connectivity, such as isomers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network Model for Citywide Air Pollution Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12630v2)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Citywide Air Pollution Forecasting tries to precisely predict the air quality multiple hours ahead for the entire city. This topic is challenged since air pollution varies in a spatiotemporal manner and depends on many complicated factors. Our previous research has solved the problem by considering the whole city as an image and leveraged a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) model to learn the spatiotemporal features. However, an image-based representation may not be ideal as air pollution and other impact factors have natural graph structures. In this research, we argue that a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) can efficiently represent the spatial features of air quality readings in the whole city. Specially, we extend the ConvLSTM model to a Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (Spatiotemporal GCRNN) model by tightly integrating a GCN architecture into an RNN structure for efficient learning spatiotemporal characteristics of air quality values and their influential factors. Our extensive experiments prove the proposed model has a better performance compare to the state-of-the-art ConvLSTM model for air pollution predicting while the number of parameters is much smaller. Moreover, our approach is also superior to a hybrid GCN-based method in a real-world air pollution dataset.</p></details> | Updated metadata |

We present Brain-MGF, a multimodal graph fusion network for joint EEG-fMRI connectivity analysis. For each modality, we construct graphs with partial-correlation edges and Pearson-profile node features, and learn subject-level embeddings via graph convolution. An adaptive softmax gate then fuses modalities with sample-specific weights to capture context-dependent contributions. Using the world's largest single-site psilocybin dataset, PsiConnect, Brain-MGF distinguishes psilocybin from no-psilocybin conditions in meditation and rest. Fusion improves over unimodal and non-adaptive variants, achieving 74.0% accuracy and 76.5% F1 score on meditation, and 76.0% accuracy with 85.8% ROC-AUC on rest. UMAP visualisations reveal clearer class separation for fused embeddings. These results indicate that adaptive graph fusion effectively integrates complementary EEG-fMRI information, providing an interpretable framework for characterising psilocybin-induced alterations in large-scale neural organisation.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[GROOT: Graph Edge Re-growth and Partitioning for the Verification of Large Designs in Logic Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18297v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional verification methods in chip design are highly time-consuming and computationally demanding, especially for large scale circuits. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained popularity as a potential solution to improve verification efficiency. However, there lacks a joint framework that considers all chip design domain knowledge, graph theory, and GPU kernel designs. To address this challenge, we introduce GROOT, an algorithm and system co-design framework that contains chip design domain knowledge and redesigned GPU kernels, to improve verification efficiency. More specifically, we create node features utilizing the circuit node types and the polarity of the connections between the input edges to nodes in And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs). We utilize a graph partitioning algorithm to divide the large graphs into smaller sub-graphs for fast GPU processing and develop a graph edge re-growth algorithm to recover verification accuracy. We carefully profile the EDA graph workloads and observe the uniqueness of their polarized distribution of high degree (HD) nodes and low degree (LD) nodes. We redesign two GPU kernels (HD-kernel and LD-kernel), to fit the EDA graph learning workload on a single GPU. We compare the results with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods: GAMORA, a GNN-based approach, and the traditional ABC framework. Results show that GROOT achieves a significant reduction in memory footprint (59.38 %), with high accuracy (99.96%) for a very large CSA multiplier, i.e. 1,024 bits with a batch size of 16, which consists of 134,103,040 nodes and 268,140,544 edges. We compare GROOT with GPU-based GPU Kernel designs SOTAs such as cuSPARSE, MergePath-SpMM, and GNNAdvisor. We achieve up to 1.104x, 5.796x, and 1.469x improvement in runtime, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model Enhanced Graph Invariant Contrastive Learning for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18282v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization has emerged as a significant challenge in graph recommender systems. Traditional graph neural network algorithms often fail because they learn spurious environmental correlations instead of stable causal relationships, leading to substantial performance degradation under distribution shifts. While recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue due to their vast world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, effectively integrating this knowledge with the fine-grained topology of specific graphs to solve the OOD problem remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we propose {$\textbf{Inv}$ariant $\textbf{G}$raph $\textbf{C}$ontrastive Learning with $\textbf{LLM}$s for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation (InvGCLLM)}, an innovative causal learning framework that synergistically integrates the strengths of data-driven models and knowledge-driven LLMs. Our framework first employs a data-driven invariant learning model to generate causal confidence scores for each user-item interaction. These scores then guide an LLM to perform targeted graph refinement, leveraging its world knowledge to prune spurious connections and augment missing causal links. Finally, the structurally purified graphs provide robust supervision for a causality-guided contrastive learning objective, enabling the model to learn representations that are resilient to spurious correlations. Experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate that InvGCLLM achieves significant improvements in out-of-distribution recommendation, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Human Brain as a Combinatorial Complex](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20692v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a framework for constructing combinatorial complexes (CCs) from fMRI time series data that captures both pairwise and higher-order neural interactions through information-theoretic measures, bridging topological deep learning and network neuroscience. Current graph-based representations of brain networks systematically miss the higher-order dependencies that characterize neural complexity, where information processing often involves synergistic interactions that cannot be decomposed into pairwise relationships. Unlike topological lifting approaches that map relational structures into higher-order domains, our method directly constructs CCs from statistical dependencies in the data. Our CCs generalize graphs by incorporating higher-order cells that represent collective dependencies among brain regions, naturally accommodating the multi-scale, hierarchical nature of neural processing. The framework constructs data-driven combinatorial complexes using O-information and S-information measures computed from fMRI signals, preserving both pairwise connections and higher-order cells (e.g., triplets, quadruplets) based on synergistic dependencies. Using NetSim simulations as a controlled proof-of-concept dataset, we demonstrate our CC construction pipeline and show how both pairwise and higher-order dependencies in neural time series can be quantified and represented within a unified structure. This work provides a framework for brain network representation that preserves fundamental higher-order structure invisible to traditional graph methods, and enables the application of topological deep learning (TDL) architectures to neural data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as an Extended Abstract at the NeurReps Workshop, NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Exact computation of this parameter is NP-hard, restricting classical methods to small instances. We compare two neural paradigms: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which operate on adjacency matrix representations, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which learn directly from graph structure through message passing. Across 2,000 random graphs with up to 64 vertices, GNNs achieve markedly higher accuracy ($R^2=0.987$, MAE $=0.372$) than CNNs ($R^2=0.955$, MAE $=0.500$). Both models offer substantial speedups over exact solvers, with GNNs delivering more than $200\times$ acceleration while retaining near-perfect fidelity. Our results position GNNs as a practical surrogate for combinatorial graph invariants, with implications for scalable graph optimization and mathematical discovery.</p></details> |  |

Classical GNNs excel at graph learning but incur high computational costs in large-scale settings. We present a fully quantum Graph Neural Network (QGNN) that implements message passing via Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs). Our Quantum Graph Convolutional Layers (QGCLs) encode features into quantum states, process graphs with NISQ-compatible unitaries, and retrieve embeddings through measurement. Applied to D2D power control for SINR maximization, our QGNN matches classical performance with fewer parameters and inherent parallelism. This end-to-end PQC-based GNN marks a step toward quantum-accelerated wireless optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[FAST: Topology-Aware Frequency-Domain Distribution Matching for Coreset Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19476v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coreset selection compresses large datasets into compact, representative subsets, reducing the energy and computational burden of training deep neural networks. Existing methods are either: (i) DNN-based, which are tied to model-specific parameters and introduce architectural bias; or (ii) DNN-free, which rely on heuristics lacking theoretical guarantees. Neither approach explicitly constrains distributional equivalence, largely because continuous distribution matching is considered inapplicable to discrete sampling. Moreover, prevalent metrics (e.g., MSE, KL, MMD, CE) cannot accurately capture higher-order moment discrepancies, leading to suboptimal coresets. In this work, we propose FAST, the first DNN-free distribution-matching coreset selection framework that formulates the coreset selection task as a graph-constrained optimization problem grounded in spectral graph theory and employs the Characteristic Function Distance (CFD) to capture full distributional information in the frequency domain. We further discover that naive CFD suffers from a "vanishing phase gradient" issue in medium and high-frequency regions; to address this, we introduce an Attenuated Phase-Decoupled CFD. Furthermore, for better convergence, we design a Progressive Discrepancy-Aware Sampling strategy that progressively schedules frequency selection from low to high, preserving global structure before refining local details and enabling accurate matching with fewer frequencies while avoiding overfitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAST significantly outperforms state-of-the-art coreset selection methods across all evaluated benchmarks, achieving an average accuracy gain of 9.12%. Compared to other baseline coreset methods, it reduces power consumption by 96.57% and achieves a 2.2x average speedup, underscoring its high performance and energy efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolving Graph Learning for Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Non-stationary Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02354v2)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks have shown remarkable success in exploiting the spatial and temporal patterns on dynamic graphs. However, existing GNNs exhibit poor generalization ability under distribution shifts, which is inevitable in dynamic scenarios. As dynamic graph generation progresses amid evolving latent non-stationary environments, it is imperative to explore their effects on out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. This paper proposes a novel Evolving Graph Learning framework for OOD generalization (EvoOOD) by environment-aware invariant pattern recognition. Specifically, we first design an environment sequential variational auto-encoder to model environment evolution and infer the underlying environment distribution. Then, we introduce a mechanism for environment-aware invariant pattern recognition, tailored to address environmental diversification through inferred distributions. Finally, we conduct fine-grained causal interventions on individual nodes using a mixture of instantiated environment samples. This approach helps to distinguish spatio-temporal invariant patterns for OOD prediction, especially in non-stationary environments. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of EvoGOOD on both real-world and synthetic dynamic datasets under distribution shifts. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to study the dynamic graph OOD generalization problem from the environment evolution perspective.</p></details> | Accepted by TPAMI |
| **[Privacy Auditing of Multi-domain Graph Pre-trained Model under Membership Inference Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17989v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-domain graph pre-training has emerged as a pivotal technique in developing graph foundation models. While it greatly improves the generalization of graph neural networks, its privacy risks under membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to identify whether a specific instance was used in training (member), remain largely unexplored. However, effectively conducting MIAs against multi-domain graph pre-trained models is a significant challenge due to: (i) Enhanced Generalization Capability: Multi-domain pre-training reduces the overfitting characteristics commonly exploited by MIAs. (ii) Unrepresentative Shadow Datasets: Diverse training graphs hinder the obtaining of reliable shadow graphs. (iii) Weakened Membership Signals: Embedding-based outputs offer less informative cues than logits for MIAs. To tackle these challenges, we propose MGP-MIA, a novel framework for Membership Inference Attacks against Multi-domain Graph Pre-trained models. Specifically, we first propose a membership signal amplification mechanism that amplifies the overfitting characteristics of target models via machine unlearning. We then design an incremental shadow model construction mechanism that builds a reliable shadow model with limited shadow graphs via incremental learning. Finally, we introduce a similarity-based inference mechanism that identifies members based on their similarity to positive and negative samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed MGP-MIA and reveal the privacy risks of multi-domain graph pre-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026(Oral)</p></details> |
| **[Neural Graph Navigation for Intelligent Subgraph Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17939v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subgraph matching, a cornerstone of relational pattern detection in domains ranging from biochemical systems to social network analysis, faces significant computational challenges due to the dramatically growing search space. Existing methods address this problem within a filtering-ordering-enumeration framework, in which the enumeration stage recursively matches the query graph against the candidate subgraphs of the data graph. However, the lack of awareness of subgraph structural patterns leads to a costly brute-force enumeration, thereby critically motivating the need for intelligent navigation in subgraph matching. To address this challenge, we propose Neural Graph Navigation (NeuGN), a neuro-heuristic framework that transforms brute-force enumeration into neural-guided search by integrating neural navigation mechanisms into the core enumeration process. By preserving heuristic-based completeness guarantees while incorporating neural intelligence, NeuGN significantly reduces the \textit{First Match Steps} by up to 98.2\% compared to state-of-the-art methods across six real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Scaling Kinetic Monte-Carlo Simulations of Grain Growth with Combined Convolutional and Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17848v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNN) have emerged as a promising machine learning method for microstructure simulations such as grain growth. However, accurate modeling of realistic grain boundary networks requires large simulation cells, which GNN has difficulty scaling up to. To alleviate the computational costs and memory footprint of GNN, we propose a hybrid architecture combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) based bijective autoencoder to compress the spatial dimensions, and a GNN that evolves the microstructure in the latent space of reduced spatial sizes. Our results demonstrate that the new design significantly reduces computational costs with using fewer message passing layer (from 12 down to 3) compared with GNN alone. The reduction in computational cost becomes more pronounced as the spatial size increases, indicating strong computational scalability. For the largest mesh evaluated (160^3), our method reduces memory usage and runtime in inference by 117x and 115x, respectively, compared with GNN-only baseline. More importantly, it shows higher accuracy and stronger spatiotemporal capability than the GNN-only baseline, especially in long-term testing. Such combination of scalability and accuracy is essential for simulating realistic material microstructures over extended time scales. The improvements can be attributed to the bijective autoencoder's ability to compress information losslessly from spatial domain into a high dimensional feature space, thereby producing more expressive latent features for the GNN to learn from, while also contributing its own spatiotemporal modeling capability. The training was optimized to learn from the stochastic Potts Monte Carlo method. Our findings provide a highly scalable approach for simulating grain growth.</p></details> |  |

These models are trained on fleet movement data, including robot positions, goals, and interactions, from hundreds of thousands of robots in Amazon warehouses worldwide. DeepFleet consists of four architectures that each embody a distinct inductive bias and collectively explore key points in the design space for multi-agent foundation models: the robot-centric (RC) model is an autoregressive decision transformer operating on neighborhoods of individual robots; the robot-floor (RF) model uses a transformer with cross-attention between robots and the warehouse floor; the image-floor (IF) model applies convolutional encoding to a multi-channel image representation of the full fleet; and the graph-floor (GF) model combines temporal attention with graph neural networks for spatial relationships. In this paper, we describe these models and present our evaluation of the impact of these design choices on prediction task performance. We find that the robot-centric and graph-floor models, which both use asynchronous robot state updates and incorporate the localized structure of robot interactions, show the most promise. We also present experiments that show that these two models can make effective use of larger warehouses operation datasets as the models are scaled up.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, these structures rely on a binary multiplication operator and therefore model only pairwise interactions. Many symbolic AI tasks are inherently triadic, including subject-predicate-object relations in knowledge graphs, logical rules involving two premises and one conclusion, and multi-entity dependencies in structured decision processes. Existing neural architectures usually approximate these interactions by flattening or factorizing them into binary components, which weakens inductive structure, distorts relational meaning, and reduces interpretability. This paper introduces the Neural Ternary Semiring (NTS), a learnable and differentiable algebraic framework grounded in the theory of ternary Gamma-semirings. The central idea is to replace the usual binary product with a native ternary operator implemented by neural networks and guided by algebraic regularizers enforcing approximate associativity and distributivity. This construction allows triadic relationships to be represented directly rather than reconstructed from binary interactions. We establish a soundness result showing that, when algebraic violations vanish during training, the learned operator converges to a valid ternary Gamma-semiring. We also outline an evaluation strategy for triadic reasoning tasks such as knowledge-graph completion and rule-based inference. These insights demonstrate that ternary Gamma-semirings provide a mathematically principled and practically effective foundation for learnable symbolic reasoning.</p></details> |  |

While important for general security purposes, real-time applicable pursuit strategies for graph-based PEGs are currently missing when the pursuers only have imperfect information about the evader's position. Although state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Equilibrium Policy Generalization (EPG) and Grasper provide guidelines for learning graph neural network (GNN) policies robust to different game dynamics, they are restricted to the scenario of perfect information and do not take into account the possible case where the evader can predict the pursuers' actions. This paper introduces the first approach to worst-case robust real-time pursuit strategies (R2PS) under partial observability. We first prove that a traditional dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for solving Markov PEGs maintains optimality under the asynchronous moves by the evader. Then, we propose a belief preservation mechanism about the evader's possible positions, extending the DP pursuit strategies to a partially observable setting. Finally, we embed the belief preservation into the state-of-the-art EPG framework to finish our R2PS learning scheme, which leads to a real-time pursuer policy through cross-graph reinforcement learning against the asynchronous-move DP evasion strategies. After reinforcement learning, our policy achieves robust zero-shot generalization to unseen real-world graph structures and consistently outperforms the policy directly trained on the test graphs by the existing game RL approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking the Curse of Knowledge: Towards Effective Multimodal Recommendation using Knowledge Soft Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07419v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A critical challenge in contemporary recommendation systems lies in effectively leveraging multimodal content to enhance recommendation personalization. Although various solutions have been proposed, most fail to account for discrepancies between knowledge extracted through isolated feature extraction and its application in recommendation tasks. Specifically, multimodal feature extraction does not incorporate task-specific prior knowledge, while downstream recommendation tasks typically use these features as auxiliary information. This misalignment often introduces biases in model fitting and degrades performance, a phenomenon we refer to as the curse of knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose a knowledge soft integration framework designed to balance the utilization of multimodal features with the biases they may introduce. The framework, named Knowledge Soft Integration (KSI), comprises two key components: the Structure Efficient Injection (SEI) module and the Semantic Soft Integration (SSI) module. The SEI module employs a Refined Graph Neural Network (RGNN) to model inter-modal correlations among items while introducing a regularization term to minimize redundancy in user and item representations. In parallel, the SSI module utilizes a self-supervised retrieval task to implicitly integrate multimodal semantic knowledge, thereby enhancing the semantic distinctiveness of item representations. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating KSI's effectiveness. Furthermore, these results underscore the ability of the SEI and SSI modules to reduce representation redundancy and mitigate the curse of knowledge in multimodal recommendation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM)</p></details> |

They are finding an increasing range of applications; however, as with other modern machine learning techniques, their theoretical understanding is limited. GNNs can encounter difficulties in gathering information from nodes that are far apart by iterated aggregation steps. This situation is partly caused by so-called oversmoothing; and overcoming it is one of the practically motivated challenges. We consider the situation where information is aggregated by multiple steps of convolution, leading to graph convolutional networks (GCNs). We analyze the generalization performance of a basic GCN, trained for node classification on data generated by the contextual stochastic block model. We predict its asymptotic performance by deriving the free energy of the problem, using the replica method, in the high-dimensional limit. Calling depth the number of convolutional steps, we show the importance of going to large depth to approach the Bayes-optimality. We detail how the architecture of the GCN has to scale with the depth to avoid oversmoothing. The resulting large depth limit can be close to the Bayes-optimality and leads to a continuous GCN. Technically, we tackle this continuous limit via an approach that resembles dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) with constraints at the initial and final times. An expansion around large regularization allows us to solve the corresponding equations for the performance of the deep GCN. This promising tool may contribute to the analysis of further deep neural networks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.</p></details> |  |
| **[How LLMs Learn to Reason: A Complex Network Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23629v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large language models with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) exhibits a set of distinctive and puzzling behaviors that remain poorly understood, including a two-stage learning curve, a V-shaped response-length trajectory, and a pronounced vulnerability to catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose that these behaviors are emergent collective phenomena governed not by neural implementation details, but by the topological evolution of the latent reasoning graph in semantic space. By demonstrating a dynamical isomorphism between a 1.5B-parameter LLM and a minimal Concept Network Model (CoNet), we trace the causal source to the self-organization of a sparse concept web pinned to an average degree of two. This geometric perspective provides a unified physical explanation for the observed anomalies: the V-shaped trajectory tracks the evolution from parallel local skill optimization to global network integration; catastrophic forgetting stems from the topological disconnection of critical ``trunk'' edges; and policy collapse arises from the accumulation of sequential transitions at the web's leaf nodes, where broad exploration abruptly freezes into rigid, high-reward trajectories. Identifying a ``maximally frustrated state'' at the transition between learning stages, we propose Annealed-RLVR, a principled algorithm that injects a targeted SFT ``heating'' step to resolve this topological bottleneck. Experiments confirm that this theory-driven intervention outperforms standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks (including Minerva and AIME). By recasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of structural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for engineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 11 figures, 1 table, under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

We propose Topologic Attention Networks, a new framework that applies topologic attention, a probabilistic mechanism that learns how information should flow through both direct and indirect connections in a graph. Unlike conventional attention that depends on explicit pairwise interactions, topologic attention emerges from the learned information propagation of the graph, enabling unified reasoning over local and global relationships.

| **[GCL-OT: Graph Contrastive Learning with Optimal Transport for Heterophilic Text-Attributed Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16778v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, structure-text contrastive learning has shown promising performance on text-attributed graphs by leveraging the complementary strengths of graph neural networks and language models. However, existing methods typically rely on homophily assumptions in similarity estimation and hard optimization objectives, which limit their applicability to heterophilic graphs. Although existing methods can mitigate heterophily through structural adjustments or neighbor aggregation, they usually treat textual embeddings as static targets, leading to suboptimal alignment. In this work, we identify the multi-granular heterophily in text-attributed graphs, including complete heterophily, partial heterophily, and latent homophily, which makes structure-text alignment particularly challenging due to mixed, noisy, and missing semantic correlations. To achieve flexible and bidirectional alignment, we propose GCL-OT, a novel graph contrastive learning framework with optimal transport, equipped with tailored mechanisms for each type of heterophily. Specifically, for partial heterophily, we design a RealSoftMax-based similarity estimator to emphasize key neighbor-word interactions while easing background noise. For complete heterophily, we introduce a prompt-based filter that adaptively excludes irrelevant noise during optimal transport alignment. Furthermore, we incorporate OT-guided soft supervision to uncover potential neighbors with similar semantics, enhancing the learning of latent homophily. Theoretical analysis shows that GCL-OT can improve the mutual information bound and Bayes error guarantees. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks show that GCL-OT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, verifying its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |
| **[When Structure Doesn't Help: LLMs Do Not Read Text-Attributed Graphs as Effectively as We Expected](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16767v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs provide a unified representation of semantic content and relational structure, making them a natural fit for domains such as molecular modeling, citation networks, and social graphs. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have excelled at understanding natural language and integrating cross-modal signals, sparking interest in their potential for graph reasoning. Recent work has explored this by either designing template-based graph templates or using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode structural information. In this study, we investigate how different strategies for encoding graph structure affect LLM performance on text-attributed graphs. Surprisingly, our systematic experiments reveal that: (i) LLMs leveraging only node textual descriptions already achieve strong performance across tasks; and (ii) most structural encoding strategies offer marginal or even negative gains. We show that explicit structural priors are often unnecessary and, in some cases, counterproductive when powerful language models are involved. This represents a significant departure from traditional graph learning paradigms and highlights the need to rethink how structure should be represented and utilized in the LLM era. Our study is to systematically challenge the foundational assumption that structure is inherently beneficial for LLM-based graph reasoning, opening the door to new, semantics-driven approaches for graph learning.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Dialogue Diplomats, a novel end-to-end multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework designed for automated conflict resolution and consensus building in complex, dynamic environments. The proposed system integrates advanced deep reinforcement learning architectures with dialogue-based negotiation protocols, enabling autonomous agents to engage in sophisticated conflict resolution through iterative communication and strategic adaptation. We present three primary contributions: first, a novel Hierarchical Consensus Network (HCN) architecture that combines attention mechanisms with graph neural networks to model inter-agent dependencies and conflict dynamics. second, a Progressive Negotiation Protocol (PNP) that structures multi-round dialogue interactions with adaptive concession strategies; and third, a Context-Aware Reward Shaping mechanism that balances individual agent objectives with collective consensus goals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Quantum Key Distribution Network Performance using Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16468v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes an optimization of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Networks using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) framework. Today, the development of quantum computers threatens the security systems of classical cryptography. Moreover, as QKD networks are designed for protecting secret communication, they suffer from multiple operational difficulties: adaptive to dynamic conditions, optimization for multiple parameters and effective resource utilization. In order to overcome these obstacles, we propose a GNN-based framework which can model QKD networks as dynamic graphs and extracts exploitable characteristics from these networks' structure. The graph contains not only topological information but also specific characteristics associated with quantum communication (the number of edges between nodes, etc). Experimental results demonstrate that the GNN-optimized QKD network achieves a substantial increase in total key rate (from 27.1 Kbits/s to 470 Kbits/s), a reduced average QBER (from 6.6% to 6.0%), and maintains path integrity with a slight reduction in average transmission distance (from 7.13 km to 6.42 km). Furthermore, we analyze network performance across varying scales (10 to 250 nodes), showing improved link prediction accuracy and enhanced key generation rate in medium-sized networks. This work introduces a novel operation mode for QKD networks, shifting the paradigm of network optimization through adaptive and scalable quantum communication systems that enhance security and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, and 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Graph Neural Networks for Surgical Scene Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16430v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Accurate identification of hepatocystic anatomy is critical to preventing surgical complications during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Deep learning models often struggle with occlusions, long-range dependencies, and capturing the fine-scale geometry of rare structures. This work addresses these challenges by introducing graph-based segmentation approaches that enhance spatial and semantic understanding in surgical scene analyses. Methods: We propose two segmentation models integrating Vision Transformer (ViT) feature encoders with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to explicitly model spatial relationships between anatomical regions. (1) A static k Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) graph with a Graph Convolutional Network with Initial Residual and Identity Mapping (GCNII) enables stable long-range information propagation. (2) A dynamic Differentiable Graph Generator (DGG) with a Graph Attention Network (GAT) supports adaptive topology learning. Both models are evaluated on the Endoscapes-Seg50 and CholecSeg8k benchmarks. Results: The proposed approaches achieve up to 7-8% improvement in Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and 6% improvement in Mean Dice (mDice) scores over state-of-the-art baselines. It produces anatomically coherent predictions, particularly on thin, rare and safety-critical structures. Conclusion: The proposed graph-based segmentation methods enhance both performance and anatomical consistency in surgical scene segmentation. By combining ViT-based global context with graph-based relational reasoning, the models improve interpretability and reliability, paving the way for safer laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery through a precise identification of critical anatomical features.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Unsupervised Graph Neural Network Framework for Balanced Multipatterning in Advanced Electronic Design Automation Layouts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16374v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multipatterning is an essential decomposition strategy in electronic design automation (EDA) that overcomes lithographic limitations when printing dense circuit layouts. Although heuristic-based backtracking and SAT solvers can address these challenges, they often struggle to simultaneously handle both complex constraints and secondary objectives. In this study, we present a hybrid workflow that casts multipatterning as a variant of a constrained graph coloring problem with the primary objective of minimizing feature violations and a secondary objective of balancing the number of features on each mask. Our pipeline integrates two main components: (1) A GNN-based agent, trained in an unsupervised manner to generate initial color predictions, which are refined by (2) refinement strategies (a GNN-based heuristic and simulated annealing) that together enhance solution quality and balance. Experimental evaluation in both proprietary data sets and publicly available open source layouts demonstrate complete conflict-free decomposition and consistent color balancing. The proposed framework provides a reproducible, data-efficient and deployable baseline for scalable layout decomposition in EDA workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>manus...</summary><p>manuscript under review</p></details> |

However, these models inherit critical limitations found in deep learning such as the lack of explainability, robustness, adaptability, and verifiable compliance with physical and regulatory constraints. In addition, the vision for an AI-native 6G network demands a level of intelligence that is deeply embedded into the systems and is trustworthy. In this vision paper, we argue that the neuro-symbolic paradigm, which integrates data-driven neural networks with rule- and logic-based symbolic reasoning, is essential for bridging this gap. We envision a novel Neuro-Symbolic framework that integrates universal RF embeddings with symbolic knowledge graphs and differentiable logic layers. This hybrid approach enables models to learn from large datasets while reasoning over explicit domain knowledge, enabling trustworthy, generalizable, and efficient wireless AI that can meet the demands of future networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: AI and ML for Next-Generation Wireless Communications and Networking (AI4NextG)</p></details> |
| **[Structural-Spectral Graph Convolution with Evidential Edge Learning for Hyperspectral Image Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09920v4)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering groups pixels into clusters without labeled data, which is an important yet challenging task. For large-scale HSIs, most methods rely on superpixel segmentation and perform superpixel-level clustering based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, existing GNNs cannot fully exploit the spectral information of the input HSI, and the inaccurate superpixel topological graph may lead to the confusion of different class semantics during information aggregation. To address these challenges, we first propose a structural-spectral graph convolutional operator (SSGCO) tailored for graph-structured HSI superpixels to improve their representation quality through the co-extraction of spatial and spectral features. Second, we propose an evidence-guided adaptive edge learning (EGAEL) module that adaptively predicts and refines edge weights in the superpixel topological graph. We integrate the proposed method into a contrastive learning framework to achieve clustering, where representation learning and clustering are simultaneously conducted. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves clustering accuracy by 2.61%, 6.06%, 4.96% and 3.15% over the best compared methods on four HSI datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/jhqi/SSGCO-EGAEL.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a hybrid deep learning framework recipe for weed detection that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs), and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to build robustness to multiple field conditions. A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based augmentation method was imposed to balance class distributions and better generalize the model. Further, a self-supervised contrastive pre-training method helps to learn more features from limited annotated data. Experimental results yield superior results with 99.33% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on multi-benchmark datasets. The proposed model architecture enables local, global, and relational feature representations and offers high interpretability and adaptability. Practically, the framework allows real-time, efficient deployment of edge devices for automated weed detecting, reducing over-reliance on herbicides and providing scalable, sustainable precision-farming options.</p></details> |  |

While recent neural architectures capture content and structural features, they often fail to reveal the underlying causal mechanisms of misinformation spread. We propose CausalMamba, a novel framework that integrates Mamba-based sequence modeling, graph convolutional networks (GCNs), and differentiable causal discovery via NOTEARS. CausalMamba learns joint representations of temporal tweet sequences and reply structures, while uncovering latent causal graphs to identify influential nodes within each propagation chain. Experiments on the Twitter15 dataset show that our model achieves competitive classification performance compared to strong baselines, and uniquely enables counterfactual intervention analysis. Qualitative results demonstrate that removing top-ranked causal nodes significantly alters graph connectivity, offering interpretable insights into rumor dynamics. Our framework provides a unified approach for rumor classification and influence analysis, paving the way for more explainable and actionable misinformation detection systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. 9 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables.
