The current works are still limited in their ability to perform reasoning that involves both time-series and the corresponding textual content. We address this gap by introducing Chat-TS, a large language model (LLM) based framework designed to support reasoning over time series and textual data. Unlike traditional models, Chat-TS integrates time-series tokens into LLMs' vocabulary, enhancing its reasoning ability over both modalities without compromising core natural language capabilities. To support learning and evaluation, we contribute new datasets: the TS Instruct Training Dataset (pairing diverse time-series data with relevant text instructions and responses for instruction tuning), the TS Instruct Question and Answer (QA) Gold Dataset (multiple-choice questions to evaluate multimodal reasoning), and a TS Instruct Quantitative Probing Set (a small subset of TS Instruct QA reasoning tasks alongside math and decision-making questions for LLM evaluation). We design a training strategy to preserve the inherent reasoning capabilities of LLMs while augmenting them for time-series reasoning. Experiments show that Chat-TS achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal reasoning tasks by maintaining strong natural language proficiency while improving time-series reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variable Splitting Binary Tree Models Based on Bayesian Context Tree Models for Time Series Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16112v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a variable splitting binary tree (VSBT) model based on Bayesian context tree (BCT) models for time series segmentation. Unlike previous applications of BCT models, the tree structure in our model represents interval partitioning on the time domain. Moreover, interval partitioning is represented by recursive logistic regression models. By adjusting logistic regression coefficients, our model can represent split positions at arbitrary locations within each interval. This enables more compact tree representations. For simultaneous estimation of both split positions and tree depth, we develop an effective inference algorithm that combines local variational approximation for logistic regression with the context tree weighting (CTW) algorithm. We present numerical examples on synthetic data demonstrating the effectiveness of our model and algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable AI to Improve Machine Learning Reliability for Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16074v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are sensitive infrastructure from both safety and economics perspectives, making their reliability critically important. Machine Learning (ML), specifically deep learning, is increasingly integrated in industrial CPS, but the inherent complexity of ML models results in non-transparent operation. Rigorous evaluation is needed to prevent models from exhibiting unexpected behaviour on future, unseen data. Explainable AI (XAI) can be used to uncover model reasoning, allowing a more extensive analysis of behaviour. We apply XAI to to improve predictive performance of ML models intended for industrial CPS. We analyse the effects of components from time-series data decomposition on model predictions using SHAP values. Through this method, we observe evidence on the lack of sufficient contextual information during model training. By increasing the window size of data instances, informed by the XAI findings, we are able to improve model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fully Functional Weighted Testing for Abrupt and Gradual Location Changes in Functional Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16058v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Change point tests for abrupt changes in the mean of functional data, i.e., random elements in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, are either based on dimension reduction techniques, e.g., based on principal components, or directly based on a functional CUSUM (cumulative sum) statistic. The former have often been criticized as not being fully functional and losing too much information. On the other hand, unlike the latter, they take the covariance structure of the data into account by weighting the CUSUM statistics obtained after dimension reduction with the inverse covariance matrix. In this paper, as a middle ground between these two approaches, we propose an alternative statistic that includes the covariance structure with an offset parameter to produce a scale-invariant test procedure and to increase power when the change is not aligned with the first components. We obtain the asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis for this new test statistic, allowing for time dependence of the data. Furthermore, we introduce versions of all three test statistics for gradual change situations, which have not been previously considered for functional data, and derive their limit distribution. Further results shed light on the asymptotic power behavior for all test statistics under various ground truths for the alternatives.</p></details> |  |
| **[ImputeGAP: A Comprehensive Library for Time Series Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15250v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the prevalence of sensor failures, imputation, the process of estimating missing values, has emerged as the cornerstone of time series data pre-processing. While numerous imputation algorithms have been developed to repair these data gaps, existing time series libraries provide limited imputation support. Furthermore, they often lack the ability to simulate realistic time series missingness patterns and fail to account for the impact of the imputed data on subsequent downstream analysis. This paper introduces ImputeGAP, a comprehensive library for time series imputation that supports a diverse range of imputation methods and modular missing data simulation, catering to datasets with varying characteristics. The library includes extensive customization options, such as automated hyperparameter tuning, benchmarking, explainability, downstream evaluation, and compatibility with popular time series frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Large Language Models for Time-Series Forecasting via Vector-Injected In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07903v3)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The World Wide Web needs reliable predictive capabilities to respond to changes in user behavior and usage patterns. Time series forecasting (TSF) is a key means to achieve this goal. In recent years, the large language models (LLMs) for TSF (LLM4TSF) have achieved good performance. However, there is a significant difference between pretraining corpora and time series data, making it hard to guarantee forecasting quality when directly applying LLMs to TSF; fine-tuning LLMs can mitigate this issue, but often incurs substantial computational overhead. Thus, LLM4TSF faces a dual challenge of prediction performance and compute overhead. To address this, we aim to explore a method for improving the forecasting performance of LLM4TSF while freezing all LLM parameters to reduce computational overhead. Inspired by in-context learning (ICL), we propose LVICL. LVICL uses our vector-injected ICL to inject example information into a frozen LLM, eliciting its in-context learning ability and thereby enhancing its performance on the example-related task (i.e., TSF). Specifically, we first use the LLM together with a learnable context vector adapter to extract a context vector from multiple examples adaptively. This vector contains compressed, example-related information. Subsequently, during the forward pass, we inject this vector into every layer of the LLM to improve forecasting performance. Compared with conventional ICL that adds examples into the prompt, our vector-injected ICL does not increase prompt length; moreover, adaptively deriving a context vector from examples suppresses components harmful to forecasting, thereby improving model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[StoxLSTM: A Stochastic Extended Long Short-Term Memory Network for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01187v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) network has demonstrated strong capability in modeling complex long-term dependencies in time series data. Despite its success, the deterministic architecture of xLSTM limits its representational capacity and forecasting performance, especially on challenging real-world time series datasets characterized by inherent uncertainty, stochasticity, and complex hierarchical latent dynamics. In this work, we propose StoxLSTM, a stochastic xLSTM within a designed state space modeling framework, which integrates latent stochastic variables directly into the recurrent units to effectively model deep latent temporal dynamics and uncertainty. The designed state space model follows an efficient non-autoregressive generative approach, achieving strong predictive performance without complex modifications to the original xLSTM architecture. Extensive experiments on publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrate that StoxLSTM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior performance and generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dualformer: Time-Frequency Dual Domain Learning for Long-term Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15669v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models, despite their promise for long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), suffer from an inherent low-pass filtering effect that limits their effectiveness. This issue arises due to undifferentiated propagation of frequency components across layers, causing a progressive attenuation of high-frequency information crucial for capturing fine-grained temporal variations. To address this limitation, we propose Dualformer, a principled dual-domain framework that rethinks frequency modeling from a layer-wise perspective. Dualformer introduces three key components: (1) a dual-branch architecture that concurrently models complementary temporal patterns in both time and frequency domains; (2) a hierarchical frequency sampling module that allocates distinct frequency bands to different layers, preserving high-frequency details in lower layers while modeling low-frequency trends in deeper layers; and (3) a periodicity-aware weighting mechanism that dynamically balances contributions from the dual branches based on the harmonic energy ratio of inputs, supported theoretically by a derived lower bound. This design enables structured frequency modeling and adaptive integration of time-frequency features, effectively preserving high-frequency information and enhancing generalization. Extensive experiments conducted on eight widely used benchmarks demonstrate Dualformer's robustness and superior performance, particularly on heterogeneous or weakly periodic data. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Akira-221/Dualformer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine Failure Detection Based on Projected Quantum Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15641v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting machine failures promptly is of utmost importance in industry for maintaining efficiency and minimizing downtime. This paper introduces a failure detection algorithm based on quantum computing and a statistical change-point detection approach. Our method leverages the potential of projected quantum feature maps to enhance the precision of anomaly detection in machine monitoring systems. We empirically validate our approach on benchmark multi-dimensional time series datasets as well as on a real-world dataset comprising IoT sensor readings from operational machines, ensuring the practical relevance of our study. The algorithm was executed on IBM's 133-qubit Heron quantum processor, demonstrating the feasibility of integrating quantum computing into industrial maintenance procedures. The presented results underscore the effectiveness of our quantum-based failure detection system, showcasing its capability to accurately identify anomalies in noisy time series data. This work not only highlights the potential of quantum computing in industrial diagnostics but also paves the way for more sophisticated quantum algorithms in the realm of predictive maintenance.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Assessing the informative value of macroeconomic indicators for public health forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15514v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Macroeconomic conditions influence the environments in which health systems operate, yet their value as leading signals of health system capacity has not been systematically evaluated. In this study, we examine whether selected macroeconomic indicators contain predictive information for several capacity-related public health targets, including employment in the health and social assistance workforce, new business applications in the sector, and health care construction spending. Using monthly U.S. time series data, we evaluate multiple forecasting approaches, including neural network models with different optimization strategies, generalized additive models, random forests, and time series models with exogenous macroeconomic indicators, under alternative model fitting designs. Across evaluation settings, we find that macroeconomic indicators provide a consistent and reproducible predictive signal for some public health targets, particularly workforce and infrastructure measures, while other targets exhibit weaker or less stable predictability. Models emphasizing stability and implicit regularization tend to perform more reliably during periods of economic volatility. These findings suggest that macroeconomic indicators may serve as useful upstream signals for digital public health monitoring, while underscoring the need for careful model selection and validation when translating economic trends into health system forecasting tools.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Data-driven Lake Water Quality Forecasting for Time Series with Missing Data using Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15503v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Volunteer-led lake monitoring yields irregular, seasonal time series with many gaps arising from ice cover, weather-related access constraints, and occasional human errors, complicating forecasting and early warning of harmful algal blooms. We study Secchi Disk Depth (SDD) forecasting on a 30-lake, data-rich subset drawn from three decades of in situ records collected across Maine lakes. Missingness is handled via Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), and we evaluate performance with a normalized Mean Absolute Error (nMAE) metric for cross-lake comparability. Among six candidates, ridge regression provides the best mean test performance. Using ridge regression, we then quantify the minimal sample size, showing that under a backward, recent-history protocol, the model reaches within 5% of full-history accuracy with approximately 176 training samples per lake on average. We also identify a minimal feature set, where a compact four-feature subset matches the thirteen-feature baseline within the same 5% tolerance. Bringing these results together, we introduce a joint feasibility function that identifies the minimal training history and fewest predictors sufficient to achieve the target of staying within 5% of the complete-history, full-feature baseline. In our study, meeting the 5% accuracy target required about 64 recent samples and just one predictor per lake, highlighting the practicality of targeted monitoring. Hence, our joint feasibility strategy unifies recent-history length and feature choice under a fixed accuracy target, yielding a simple, efficient rule for setting sampling effort and measurement priorities for lake researchers.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Lattice: A Confidence-Gated Hybrid System for Uncertainty-Aware Sequential Prediction with Behavioral Archetypes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15423v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Lattice, a hybrid sequential prediction system that conditionally activates learned behavioral structure using binary confidence gating. The system clusters behavior windows into behavioral archetypes and uses binary confidence gating to activate archetype-based scoring only when confidence exceeds a threshold, falling back to baseline predictions when uncertain. We validate Lattice on recommendation systems (MovieLens), scientific time-series (LIGO), and financial markets, using LSTM and transformer backbones. On MovieLens with LSTM, Lattice achieves +31.9% improvement over LSTM baseline in HR@10 (p < 3.29 x 10^-25, 30 seeds), outperforming transformer baselines by 109.4% over SASRec and 218.6% over BERT4Rec. On LIGO and financial data, the system correctly refuses archetype activation when distribution shift occurs - a successful outcome demonstrating confidence gating prevents false activation. On transformer backbones, Lattice provides 0.0% improvement (neutral, no degradation), gracefully deferring when structure is already present. This bidirectional validation - activating when patterns apply, refusing when they don't, and deferring when redundant - supports confidence gating as a promising architectural principle for managing epistemic uncertainty in safety-critical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 1 figure, uses tikz.sty</p></details> |
| **[Patch-Level Tokenization with CNN Encoders and Attention for Improved Transformer Time-Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12467v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models have shown strong performance in time-series forecasting by leveraging self-attention to model long-range temporal dependencies. However, their effectiveness depends critically on the quality and structure of input representations derived from raw multivariate time-series data, particularly as sequence length and data scale increase. This paper proposes a two-stage forecasting framework that explicitly separates local temporal representation learning from global dependency modelling. In the proposed approach, a convolutional neural network operates on fixed-length temporal patches to extract short-range temporal dynamics and non-linear feature interactions, producing compact patch-level token embeddings. Token-level self-attention is applied during representation learning to refine these embeddings, after which a Transformer encoder models inter-patch temporal dependencies to generate forecasts. The method is evaluated on a synthetic multivariate time-series dataset with controlled static and dynamic factors, using an extended sequence length and a larger number of samples. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms a convolutional baseline under increased temporal context and remains competitive with a strong patch-based Transformer model. These findings indicate that structured patch-level tokenization provides a scalable and effective representation for multivariate time-series forecasting, particularly when longer input sequences are considered.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[NeuroClean: A Generalized Machine-Learning Approach to Neural Time-Series Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01951v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalography (EEG) and local field potentials (LFP) are two widely used techniques to record electrical activity from the brain. These signals are used in both the clinical and research domains for multiple applications. However, most brain data recordings suffer from a myriad of artifacts and noise sources other than the brain itself. Thus, a major requirement for their use is proper and, given current volumes of data, a fully automatized conditioning. As a means to this end, here we introduce an unsupervised, multipurpose EEG/LFP preprocessing method, the NeuroClean pipeline. In addition to its completeness and reliability, NeuroClean is an unsupervised series of algorithms intended to mitigate reproducibility issues and biases caused by human intervention. The pipeline is designed as a five-step process, including the common bandpass and line noise filtering, and bad channel rejection. However, it incorporates an efficient independent component analysis with an automatic component rejection based on a clustering algorithm. This machine learning classifier is used to ensure that task-relevant information is preserved after each step of the cleaning process. We used several data sets to validate the pipeline. NeuroClean removed several common types of artifacts from the signal. Moreover, in the context of motor tasks of varying complexity, it yielded more than 97% accuracy (vs. a chance-level of 33.3%) in an optimized Multinomial Logistic Regression model after cleaning the data, compared to the raw data, which performed at 74% accuracy. These results show that NeuroClean is a promising pipeline and workflow that can be applied to future work and studies to achieve better generalization and performance on machine learning pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Regime Detection in Energy Markets With Augmented Time Series Structural Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04361v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Energy markets exhibit complex causal relationships between weather patterns, generation technologies, and price formation, with regime changes occurring continuously rather than at discrete break points. Current approaches model electricity prices without explicit causal interpretation or counterfactual reasoning capabilities. We introduce Augmented Time Series Causal Models (ATSCM) for energy markets, extending counterfactual reasoning frameworks to multivariate temporal data with learned causal structure. Our approach models energy systems through interpretable factors (weather, generation mix, demand patterns), rich grid dynamics, and observable market variables. We integrate neural causal discovery to learn time-varying causal graphs without requiring ground truth DAGs. Applied to real-world electricity price data, ATSCM enables novel counterfactual queries such as "What would prices be under different renewable generation scenarios?".</p></details> | <details><summary>EurIP...</summary><p>EurIPS 2025 Workshop Causality for Impact: Practical challenges for real-world applications of causal methods</p></details> |
| **[Towards Causal Market Simulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04469v4)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Market generators using deep generative models have shown promise for synthetic financial data generation, but existing approaches lack causal reasoning capabilities essential for counterfactual analysis and risk assessment. We propose a Time-series Neural Causal Model VAE (TNCM-VAE) that combines variational autoencoders with structural causal models to generate counterfactual financial time series while preserving both temporal dependencies and causal relationships. Our approach enforces causal constraints through directed acyclic graphs in the decoder architecture and employs the causal Wasserstein distance for training. We validate our method on synthetic autoregressive models inspired by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, demonstrating superior performance in counterfactual probability estimation with L1 distances as low as 0.03-0.10 compared to ground truth. The model enables financial stress testing, scenario analysis, and enhanced backtesting by generating plausible counterfactual market trajectories that respect underlying causal mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICAIF...</summary><p>ICAIF 2025 Workshop on Rethinking Financial Time-Series</p></details> |
| **[InstructTime++: Time Series Classification with Multimodal Language Modeling via Implicit Feature Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14968v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing time series classification methods adopt a discriminative paradigm that maps input sequences directly to one-hot encoded class labels. While effective, this paradigm struggles to incorporate contextual features and fails to capture semantic relationships among classes. To address these limitations, we propose InstructTime, a novel framework that reformulates time series classification as a multimodal generative task. Specifically, continuous numerical sequences, contextual textual features, and task instructions are treated as multimodal inputs, while class labels are generated as textual outputs by tuned language models. To bridge the modality gap, InstructTime introduces a time series discretization module that converts continuous sequences into discrete temporal tokens, together with an alignment projection layer and a generative self-supervised pre-training strategy to enhance cross-modal representation alignment. Building upon this framework, we further propose InstructTime++, which extends InstructTime by incorporating implicit feature modeling to compensate for the limited inductive bias of language models. InstructTime++ leverages specialized toolkits to mine informative implicit patterns from raw time series and contextual inputs, including statistical feature extraction and vision-language-based image captioning, and translates them into textual descriptions for seamless integration. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of InstructTime++.</p></details> |  |
| **[ExoMiner++ 2.0: Vetting TESS Full-Frame Image Transit Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14877v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) Full-Frame Images (FFIs) provide photometric time series for millions of stars, enabling transit searches beyond the limited set of pre-selected 2-minute targets. However, FFIs present additional challenges for transit identification and vetting. In this work, we apply ExoMiner++ 2.0, an adaptation of the ExoMiner++ framework originally developed for TESS 2-minute data, to FFI light curves. The model is used to perform large-scale planet versus non-planet classification of Threshold Crossing Events across the sectors analyzed in this study. We construct a uniform vetting catalog of all evaluated signals and assess model performance under different observing conditions. We find that ExoMiner++ 2.0 generalizes effectively to the FFI domain, providing robust discrimination between planetary signals, astrophysical false positives, and instrumental artifacts despite the limitations inherent to longer cadence data. This work extends the applicability of ExoMiner++ to the full TESS dataset and supports future population studies and follow-up prioritization.</p></details> |  |
| **[CT-PatchTST: Channel-Time Patch Time-Series Transformer for Long-Term Renewable Energy Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08620v4)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate forecasting of renewable energy generation is fundamental to enhancing the dynamic performance of modern power grids, especially under high renewable penetration. This paper presents Channel-Time Patch Time-Series Transformer (CT-PatchTST), a novel deep learning model designed to provide long-term, high-fidelity forecasts of wind and solar power. Unlike conventional time-series models, CT-PatchTST captures both temporal dependencies and inter-channel correlations-features that are critical for effective energy storage planning, control, and dispatch. Reliable forecasting enables proactive deployment of energy storage systems (ESSs), helping to mitigate uncertainties in renewable output, reduce system response time, and optimize storage operation based on location-specific flow and voltage conditions. Evaluated on real-world datasets from Denmark's offshore wind, onshore wind, and solar generation, CT-PatchTST outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and robustness. By enabling predictive, data-driven coordination of ESSs across integrated source-grid-load-storage systems, this work contributes to the design of more stable, responsive, and cost-efficient power networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in: 2025 10th International Conference on Computer and Information Processing Technology (ISCIPT)</p></details> |
| **[Resampling-free Inference for Time Series via RKHS Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13468v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we study nonparametric inference problems in the context of multivariate or functional time series, including testing for goodness-of-fit, the presence of a change point in the marginal distribution, and the independence of two time series, among others. Most methodologies available in the existing literature address these problems by employing a bandwidth-dependent bootstrap or subsampling approach, which can be computationally expensive and/or sensitive to the choice of bandwidth. To address these limitations, we propose a novel class of kernel-based tests by embedding the data into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and construct test statistics using sample splitting, projection, and self-normalization (SN) techniques. Through a new conditioning technique, we demonstrate that our test statistics have pivotal limiting null distributions under strong mixing and mild moment assumptions. We also analyze the limiting power of our tests under local alternatives. Finally, we showcase the superior size accuracy and computational efficiency of our methods as compared to some existing ones.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Fast Algorithm for the Finite Expression Method in Learning Dynamics on Complex Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03092v3)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex network data is prevalent in various real-world domains, including physical, technological, and biological systems. Despite this prevalence, predicting trends and understanding behavioral patterns in complex systems remain challenging due to poorly understood underlying mechanisms. While data-driven methods have advanced in uncovering governing equations from time series data, efforts to extract physical laws from network data are limited and often struggle with incomplete or noisy data. Additionally, they suffer from computational costs on network data, making it difficult to scale to real-world networks. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach called the Finite Expression Method (FEX) and its fast algorithm for learning dynamics on complex networks. FEX represents dynamics on complex networks using binary trees composed of finite mathematical operators. The nodes within these trees are trained through a combinatorial optimization process guided by reinforcement learning techniques. This unique configuration allows FEX to capture complex dynamics with minimal prior knowledge of the system and a small dictionary of mathematical operators. We also integrate a fast, stochastic algorithm into FEX, reducing the computational complexity from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$. Our extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that FEX excels in accurately identifying dynamics across diverse network topologies and dynamic behaviors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guardrailed Elasticity Pricing: A Churn-Aware Forecasting Playbook for Subscription Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20932v2)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a marketing analytics framework that operationalizes subscription pricing as a dynamic, guardrailed decision system, uniting multivariate demand forecasting, segment-level price elasticity, and churn propensity to optimize revenue, margin, and retention. The approach blends seasonal time-series models with tree-based learners, runs Monte Carlo scenario tests to map risk envelopes, and solves a constrained optimization that enforces business guardrails on customer experience, margin floors, and allowable churn. Validated across heterogeneous SaaS portfolios, the method consistently outperforms static tiers and uniform uplifts by reallocating price moves toward segments with higher willingness-to-pay while protecting price-sensitive cohorts. The system is designed for real-time recalibration via modular APIs and includes model explainability for governance and compliance. Managerially, the framework functions as a strategy playbook that clarifies when to shift from flat to dynamic pricing, how to align pricing with CLV and MRR targets, and how to embed ethical guardrails, enabling durable growth without eroding customer trust.</p></details> |  |
| **[Factor Analysis of Multivariate Stochastic Volatility Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14199v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling the time-varying covariance structures of high-dimensional variables is critical across diverse scientific and industrial applications; however, existing approaches exhibit notable limitations in either modeling flexibility or inferential efficiency. For instance, change-point modeling fails to account for the continuous time-varying nature of covariance structures, while GARCH and stochastic volatility models suffer from over-parameterization and the risk of overfitting. To address these challenges, we propose a Bayesian factor modeling framework designed to enable simultaneous inference of both the covariance structure of a high-dimensional time series and its time-varying dynamics. The associated Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm not only features an exact, closed-form update for the M-step but also is easily generalizable to more complex settings, such as spatiotemporal multivariate factor analysis. We validate our method through simulation studies and real-data experiments using climate and financial datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Journal of the American Statistical Association (JASA)</p></details> |
| **[Task-Aware Mixture-of-Experts for Time Series Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22279v3)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Analysis is widely used in various real-world applications such as weather forecasting, financial fraud detection, imputation for missing data in IoT systems, and classification for action recognization. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), as a powerful architecture, though demonstrating effectiveness in NLP, still falls short in adapting to versatile tasks in time series analytics due to its task-agnostic router and the lack of capability in modeling channel correlations. In this study, we propose a novel, general MoE-based time series framework called PatchMoE to support the intricate ``knowledge'' utilization for distinct tasks, thus task-aware. Based on the observation that hierarchical representations often vary across tasks, e.g., forecasting vs. classification, we propose a Recurrent Noisy Gating to utilize the hierarchical information in routing, thus obtaining task-sepcific capability. And the routing strategy is operated on time series tokens in both temporal and channel dimensions, and encouraged by a meticulously designed Temporal \& Channel Load Balancing Loss to model the intricate temporal and channel correlations. Comprehensive experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of PatchMoE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Chi-Square Method can model and forecast complex time series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01540v4)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show how intensive, large and accurate time series can allow us to see through time. Many phenomena have aperiodic and periodic components. An ideal time series analysis method would detect such trend and signal(-s) combinations. The widely-used Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and other frequency-domain parametric time series analysis methods have many application limitations constraining the trend and signal(-s) detection. We show that none of those limitations constrains our Discrete Chi-square Method (DCM) which can detect signal(-s) superimposed on an unknown trend. Our simulated time series analyses ascertain the revolutionary Window Dimension Effect (WDE): ``For any sample window $ΔT$, DCM inevitably detects the correct $p(t)$ trend and $h(t)$ signal(-s) when the sample size $n$ and/or data accuracy $σ$ increase.'' The simulations also expose the DFT's weaknesses and the DCM's efficiency. The DCM's backbone is the Gauss-Markov theorem that the Least Squares (LS) is the best unbiased estimator for linear regression models. DCM can not fail because this simple method is based on the computation of a massive number of linear model LS fits. The Fisher-test gives the signal significance estimates and identifies the best DCM model from all alternative tested DCM models. The analytical solution for the non-linear DCM model is an ill-posed problem. We present a computational well-posed solution. The DCM can forecast complex time series. The best DCM model must be correct if it passes our Forecast-test. Our DCM is ideal for forecasting because its WDE spearhead is robust against short sample windows and complex time series.</p></details> | 32 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Tail-Aware Density Forecasting of Locally Explosive Time Series: A Neural Network Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14049v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a Mixture Density Network for forecasting time series that exhibit locally explosive behavior. By incorporating skewed t-distributions as mixture components, our approach offers enhanced flexibility in capturing the skewed, heavy-tailed, and potentially multimodal nature of predictive densities associated with bubble dynamics modeled by mixed causal-noncausal ARMA processes. In addition, we implement an adaptive weighting scheme that emphasizes tail observations during training and hence leads to accurate density estimation in the extreme regions most relevant for financial applications. Equally important, once trained, the MDN produces near-instantaneous density forecasts. Through extensive Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application on the natural gas price, we show that the proposed MDN-based framework delivers superior forecasting performance relative to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intermittent time series forecasting: local vs global models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14031v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intermittent time series, characterised by the presence of a significant amount of zeros, constitute a large percentage of inventory items in supply chain. Probabilistic forecasts are needed to plan the inventory levels; the predictive distribution should cover non-negative values, have a mass in zero and a long upper tail. Intermittent time series are commonly forecast using local models, which are trained individually on each time series. In the last years global models, which are trained on a large collection of time series, have become popular for time series forecasting. Global models are often based on neural networks. However, they have not yet been exhaustively tested on intermittent time series. We carry out the first study comparing state-of-the-art local (iETS, TweedieGP) and global models (D-Linear, DeepAR, Transformers) on intermittent time series. For neural networks models we consider three different distribution heads suitable for intermittent time series: negative binomial, hurdle-shifted negative binomial and Tweedie. We use, for the first time, the last two distribution heads with neural networks. We perform experiments on five large datasets comprising more than 40'000 real-world time series. Among neural networks D-Linear provides best accuracy; it also consistently outperforms the local models. Moreover, it has also low computational requirements. Transformers-based architectures are instead much more computationally demanding and less accurate. Among the distribution heads, the Tweedie provides the best estimates of the highest quantiles, while the negative binomial offers overall the best performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery</p></details> |
| **[Consensus Stability of Community Notes on X](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14002v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Community-based fact-checking systems, such as Community Notes on X (formerly Twitter), aim to mitigate online misinformation by surfacing annotations judged helpful by contributors with diverse viewpoints. While prior work has shown that the platform's bridging-based algorithm effectively selects helpful notes at the time of display, little is known about how evaluations change after notes become visible. Using a large-scale dataset of 437,396 community notes and 35 million ratings from over 580,000 contributors, we examine the stability of helpful notes and the rating dynamics that follow their initial display. We find that 30.2% of displayed notes later lose their helpful status and disappear. Using interrupted time series models, we further show that note display triggers a sharp increase in rating volume and a significant shift in rating leaning, but these effects differ across rater groups. Contributors with viewpoints similar to note authors tend to increase supportive ratings, while dissimilar contributors increase negative ratings, producing systematic post-display polarization. Counterfactual analyses suggest that this post-display polarization, particularly from dissimilar raters, plays a substantial role in note disappearance. These findings highlight the vulnerability of consensus-based fact-checking systems to polarized rating behavior and suggest pathways for improving their resilience.</p></details> | Accepted at WWW2026 |

| **[vLinear: A Powerful Linear Model for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13768v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present \textbf{vLinear}, an effective yet efficient \textbf{linear}-based multivariate time series forecaster featuring two components: the \textbf{v}ecTrans module and the WFMLoss objective. Many state-of-the-art forecasters rely on self-attention or its variants to capture multivariate correlations, typically incurring $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ computational complexity with respect to the number of variates $N$. To address this, we propose vecTrans, a lightweight module that utilizes a learnable vector to model multivariate correlations, reducing the complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N)$. Notably, vecTrans can be seamlessly integrated into Transformer-based forecasters, delivering up to 5$\times$ inference speedups and consistent performance gains. Furthermore, we introduce WFMLoss (Weighted Flow Matching Loss) as the objective. In contrast to typical \textbf{velocity-oriented} flow matching objectives, we demonstrate that a \textbf{final-series-oriented} formulation yields significantly superior forecasting accuracy. WFMLoss also incorporates path- and horizon-weighted strategies to focus learning on more reliable paths and horizons. Empirically, vLinear achieves state-of-the-art performance across 22 benchmarks and 124 forecasting settings. Moreover, WFMLoss serves as an effective plug-and-play objective, consistently improving existing forecasters. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/vLinear.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graceful forgetting: Memory as a process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11105v5)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A rational framework is proposed to explain how we accommodate unbounded sensory input within bounded memory. According to this framework, memory is stored as a statistic-like representation that is repeatedly summarized and compressed to make room for new input. Summarization of sensory input must be rapid; that of abstract trace might be slower and more deliberative, drawing on elaborative processes some of which might occasionally reach consciousness (as in mind-wandering). Short-term sensory traces are summarized as simple statistics organized into structures such as a time series, graph or dictionary, and longer-term abstract traces as more complex statistic-like structures. Summarization at multiple time scales requires an intensive process of memory curation which might account for the high metabolic consumption of the brain at rest. Summarization may be guided by heuristics to help choose which statistics to apply at each step, so that the trace is useful for a wide range of future needs, the objective being to "represent the past" rather than tune for a specific task. However, the choice of statistics (or of heuristics to guide that choice) is a potential target for learning, possibly over long-term scales of development or evolution. The framework is intended as an aid to make sense of our extensive empirical and theoretical knowledge of memory and bring us closer to understanding it in functional and mechanistic terms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Channel, Trend and Periodic-Wise Representation Learning for Multivariate Long-term Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23583v2)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Downsampling-based methods for time series forecasting have attracted increasing attention due to their superiority in capturing sequence trends. However, this approaches mainly capture dependencies within subsequences but neglect inter-subsequence and inter-channel interactions, which limits forecasting accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose CTPNet, a novel framework that explicitly learns representations from three perspectives: i) inter-channel dependencies, captured by a temporal query-based multi-head attention mechanism; ii) intra-subsequence dependencies, modeled via a Transformer to characterize trend variations; and iii) inter-subsequence dependencies, extracted by reusing the encoder with residual connections to capture global periodic patterns. By jointly integrating these levels, proposed method provides a more holistic representation of temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Though analyzing and interpreting them contributes to significant values, e.g, disaster prediction and financial risk control, current workflows mainly rely on human data scientists, which requires significant labor costs and lacks automation. To tackle this, we introduce TimeART, a framework fusing the analytical capability of strong out-of-the-box tools and the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), which serves as a fully agentic data scientist for Time Series Question Answering (TSQA). To teach the LLM-based Time Series Reasoning Models (TSRMs) strategic tool-use, we also collect a 100k expert trajectory corpus called TimeToolBench. To enhance TSRMs' generalization capability, we then devise a four-stage training strategy, which boosts TSRMs through learning from their own early experiences and self-reflections. Experimentally, we train an 8B TSRM on TimeToolBench and equip it with the TimeART framework, and it achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance on multiple TSQA tasks, which pioneers a novel approach towards agentic time series reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Parallel Schemes with Lyapunov Exponents and kNN-LLE Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13604v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse parallel schemes remain indispensable tools for computing the roots of nonlinear systems, yet their dynamical behavior can be unexpectedly rich, ranging from strong contraction to oscillatory or chaotic transients depending on the choice of algorithmic parameters and initial states. A unified analytical-data-driven methodology for identifying, measuring, and reducing such instabilities in a family of uni-parametric inverse parallel solvers is presented in this study. On the theoretical side, we derive stability and bifurcation characterizations of the underlying iterative maps, identifying parameter regions associated with periodic or chaotic behavior. On the computational side, we introduce a micro-series pipeline based on kNN-driven estimation of the local largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE), applied to scalar time series derived from solver trajectories. The resulting sliding-window Lyapunov profiles provide fine-grained, real-time diagnostics of contractive or unstable phases and reveal transient behaviors not captured by coarse linearized analysis. Leveraging this correspondence, we introduce a Lyapunov-informed parameter selection strategy that identifies solver settings associated with stable behavior, particularly when the estimated LLE indicates persistent instability. Comprehensive experiments on ensembles of perturbed initial guesses demonstrate close agreement between the theoretical stability diagrams and empirical Lyapunov profiles, and show that the proposed adaptive mechanism significantly improves robustness. The study establishes micro-series Lyapunov analysis as a practical, interpretable tool for constructing self-stabilizing root-finding schemes and opens avenues for extending such diagnostics to higher-dimensional or noise-contaminated problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 9 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

Existing methods face challenges of inadequate reasoning ability, deficient multi-turn dialogue capability, and narrow generalization. To this end, we 1) propose a multi-agent-based TS Evolution algorithm named TSEvol. On top of it, we 2) introduce the AD reasoning and multi-turn dialogue Dataset TSEData-20K and contribute the Chatbot family for AD, including ChatAD-Llama3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, and Mistral-7B. Furthermore, 3) we propose the TS Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (TKTO) to enhance ChatAD's cross-task generalization capability. Lastly, 4) we propose a LLM-driven Learning-based AD Benchmark LLADBench to evaluate the performance of ChatAD and nine baselines across seven datasets and tasks. Our three ChatAD models achieve substantial gains, up to 34.50% in accuracy, 34.71% in F1, and a 37.42% reduction in false positives. Besides, via KTKO, our optimized ChatAD achieves competitive performance in reasoning and cross-task generalization on classification, forecasting, and imputation.</p></details> |  |
| **[MN-TSG:Continuous Time Series Generation with Irregular Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13534v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series generation (TSG) plays a critical role in a wide range of domains, such as healthcare. However, most existing methods assume regularly sampled observations and fixed output resolutions, which are often misaligned with real-world scenarios where data are irregularly sampled and sparsely observed. This mismatch is particularly problematic in applications such as clinical monitoring, where irregular measurements must support downstream tasks requiring continuous and high-resolution time series. Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDEs) have shown strong potential for modeling irregular time series, yet they still face challenges in capturing complex dynamic temporal patterns and supporting continuous TSG. To address these limitations, we propose MN-TSG, a novel framework that explores Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based NCDEs and integrates them with existing TSG models for irregular and continuous generation tasks. The core of MN-TSG lies in a MoE-NCDE architecture with dynamically parameterized expert functions and a decoupled design that facilitates more effective optimization of MoE dynamics. Furthermore, we leverage existing TSG models to learn the joint distribution over the mixture of experts and the generated time series. This enables the framework not only to generate new samples, but also to produce appropriate expert configurations tailored to each sample, thereby supporting refined continuous TSG. Extensive experiments on ten public and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MN-TSG, consistently outperforming strong TSG baselines on both irregular-to-regular and irregular-to-continuous generation tasks.</p></details> | 34 pages |
| **[A Unified Variational Imputation Framework for Electric Vehicle Charging Data Using Retrieval-Augmented Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13476v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reliability of data-driven applications in electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure, such as charging demand forecasting, hinges on the availability of complete, high-quality charging data. However, real-world EV datasets are often plagued by missing records, and existing imputation methods are ill-equipped for the complex, multimodal context of charging data, often relying on a restrictive one-model-per-station paradigm that ignores valuable inter-station correlations. To address these gaps, we develop a novel PRobabilistic variational imputation framework that leverages the power of large lAnguage models and retrIeval-augmented Memory (PRAIM). PRAIM employs a pre-trained language model to encode heterogeneous data, spanning time-series demand, calendar features, and geospatial context, into a unified, semantically rich representation. This is dynamically fortified by retrieval-augmented memory that retrieves relevant examples from the entire charging network, enabling a single, unified imputation model empowered by variational neural architecture to overcome data sparsity. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that PRAIM significantly outperforms established baselines in both imputation accuracy and its ability to preserve the original data's statistical distribution, leading to substantial improvements in downstream forecasting performance.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[A Learnable Wavelet Transformer for Long-Short Equity Trading and Risk-Adjusted Return Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13435v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning profitable intraday trading policies from financial time series is challenging due to heavy noise, non-stationarity, and strong cross-sectional dependence among related assets. We propose \emph{WaveLSFormer}, a learnable wavelet-based long-short Transformer that jointly performs multi-scale decomposition and return-oriented decision learning. Specifically, a learnable wavelet front-end generates low-/high-frequency components via an end-to-end trained filter bank, guided by spectral regularizers that encourage stable and well-separated frequency bands. To fuse multi-scale information, we introduce a low-guided high-frequency injection (LGHI) module that refines low-frequency representations with high-frequency cues while controlling training stability. The model outputs a portfolio of long/short positions that is rescaled to satisfy a fixed risk budget, and is optimized directly with a trading objective and risk-aware regularization. Extensive experiments on five years of hourly data across six industry groups, evaluated over ten random seeds, demonstrate that WaveLSFormer consistently outperforms MLP, LSTM and Transformer backbones, with and without fixed discrete wavelet front-ends. On average in all industries, WaveLSFormer achieves a cumulative overall strategy return of $0.607 \pm 0.045$ and a Sharpe ratio of $2.157 \pm 0.166$, substantially improving both profitability and risk-adjusted returns over the strongest baselines.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the challenges of explainability of state-of-the-art models, we propose a prototype-driven framework for generating sparse counterfactual explanations tailored to 12-lead ECG classification models. Our method employs SHAP-based thresholds to identify critical signal segments and convert them into interval rules, uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and medoid clustering to extract representative prototypes, and aligns these prototypes to query R-peaks for coherence with the sample being explained. The framework generates counterfactuals that modify only 78% of the original signal while maintaining 81.3% validity across all classes and achieving 43% improvement in temporal stability. We evaluate three variants of our approach, Original, Sparse, and Aligned Sparse, with class-specific performance ranging from 98.9% validity for myocardial infarction (MI) to challenges with hypertrophy (HYP) detection (13.2%). This approach supports near realtime generation (< 1 second) of clinically valid counterfactuals and provides a foundation for interactive explanation platforms. Our findings establish design principles for physiologically-aware counterfactual explanations in AI-based diagnosis systems and outline pathways toward user-controlled explanation interfaces for clinical deployment.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, it is crucial to detect Active Regions (ARs) before they start forming on the solar surface. This will enable the development of early-warning capabilities for upcoming space weather disturbances. For this reason, we prepared the Solar Active Region Emergence Dataset (SolARED). The dataset is derived from full-disk maps of the Doppler velocity, magnetic field, and continuum intensity, obtained by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). SolARED includes time series of remapped, tracked, and binned data that characterize the evolution of acoustic power of solar oscillations, unsigned magnetic flux, and continuum intensity for 50 large ARs before, during, and after their emergence on the solar surface, as well as surrounding areas observed on the solar disc between 2010 and 2023. The resulting ML-ready SolARED dataset is designed to support enhancements of predictive capabilities, enabling the development of operational forecasts for the emergence of active regions. The SolARED dataset is available at https://sun.njit.edu/sarportal/, through an interactive visualization web application.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 6 figures, submitted to the Springer Nature - Solar Physics Journal</p></details> |
| **[Modular Deep Learning for Multivariate Time-Series: Decoupling Imputation and Downstream Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03941v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values are pervasive in large-scale time-series data, posing challenges for reliable analysis and decision-making. Many neural architectures have been designed to model and impute the complex and heterogeneous missingness patterns of such data. Most existing methods are end-to-end, rendering imputation tightly coupled with downstream predictive tasks and leading to limited reusability of the trained model, reduced interpretability, and challenges in assessing model quality. In this paper, we call for a modular approach that decouples imputation and downstream tasks, enabling independent optimisation and greater adaptability. Using the largest open-source Python library for deep learning-based time-series analysis, PyPOTS, we evaluate a modular pipeline across six state-of-the-art models that perform imputation and prediction on seven datasets spanning multiple domains. Our results show that a modular approach maintains high performance while prioritising flexibility and reusability - qualities that are crucial for real-world applications. Through this work, we aim to demonstrate how modularity can benefit multivariate time-series analysis, achieving a balance between performance and adaptability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Visual Realism: Toward Reliable Financial Time Series Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12990v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models for financial time series often create data that look realistic and even reproduce stylized facts such as fat tails or volatility clustering. However, these apparent successes break down under trading backtests: models like GANs or WGAN-GP frequently collapse, yielding extreme and unrealistic results that make the synthetic data unusable in practice. We identify the root cause in the neglect of financial asymmetry and rare tail events, which strongly affect market risk but are often overlooked by objectives focusing on distribution matching. To address this, we introduce the Stylized Facts Alignment GAN (SFAG), which converts key stylized facts into differentiable structural constraints and jointly optimizes them with adversarial loss. This multi-constraint design ensures that generated series remain aligned with market dynamics not only in plots but also in backtesting. Experiments on the Shanghai Composite Index (2004--2024) show that while baseline GANs produce unstable and implausible trading outcomes, SFAG generates synthetic data that preserve stylized facts and support robust momentum strategy performance. Our results highlight that structure-preserving objectives are essential to bridge the gap between superficial realism and practical usability in financial generative modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

The scarcity of labeled samples limits model generalization and leaves valuable unlabeled data underutilized. We propose Dual-Domain Fusion (DDF), a new model-agnostic semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework applicable to any time-series signal. DDF performs dual-domain training by combining the one-dimensional time-domain signals with their two-dimensional time-frequency representations and fusing them to maximize learning performance. Its tri-model architecture consists of time-domain, time-frequency, and fusion components, enabling the model to exploit complementary information across domains during training. To support practical deployment, DDF maintains the same inference cost as standard time-domain models by discarding the time-frequency and fusion branches at test time. Experimental results on two public fault diagnosis datasets demonstrate substantial accuracy improvements of 8-46% over widely used SSL methods FixMatch, MixMatch, Mean Teacher, Adversarial Training, and Self-training. These results show that DDF provides an effective and generalizable strategy for semi-supervised time-series classification.</p></details> |  |

Similarly, online time series forecasting (OTSF) is a real-world problem where data evolve in time and success depends on both rapid adaptation and long-term memory. Indeed, time-varying and regime-switching forecasting models have been extensively studied, offering a strong justification for the use of OCL in these settings. Building on recent work that applies OCL to OTSF, this paper aims to strengthen the theoretical and practical connections between time series methods and OCL. First, we reframe neural network optimization as a parameter filtering problem, showing that natural gradient descent is a score-driven method and proving its information-theoretic optimality. Then, we show that using a Student's t likelihood in addition to natural gradient induces a bounded update, which improves robustness to outliers. Finally, we introduce Natural Score-driven Replay (NatSR), which combines our robust optimizer with a replay buffer and a dynamic scale heuristic that improves fast adaptation at regime drifts. Empirical results demonstrate that NatSR achieves stronger forecasting performance than more complex state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

This fundamental weakness leads to noisy, unstable anomaly scores, hindering reliable detection. To address this, we propose Constrained Gaussian-Noise Optimization and Smoothing (COGNOS), a universal, model-agnostic enhancement framework that tackles this issue at its source. COGNOS introduces a novel Gaussian-White Noise Regularization strategy during training, which directly constrains the model's output residuals to conform to a Gaussian white noise distribution. This engineered statistical property creates the ideal precondition for our second contribution: Adaptive Residual Kalman Smoother that operates as a statistically robust estimator to denoise the raw anomaly scores. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that COGNOS consistently enhances the performance of state-of-the-art backbones significantly, validating the efficacy of coupling statistical regularization with adaptive filtering.</p></details> |  |

However, most TTA methods are designed for independent data, often overlooking the time series data and rarely addressing forecasting tasks. This paper presents AdaNODEs, an innovative source-free TTA method tailored explicitly for time series forecasting. By leveraging Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs), we propose a novel adaptation framework that accommodates the unique characteristics of distribution shifts in time series data. Moreover, we innovatively propose a new loss function to tackle TTA for forecasting tasks. AdaNODEs only requires updating limited model parameters, showing effectiveness in capturing temporal dependencies while avoiding significant memory usage. Extensive experiments with one- and high-dimensional data demonstrate that AdaNODEs offer relative improvements of 5.88\% and 28.4\% over the SOTA baselines, especially demonstrating robustness across higher severity distribution shifts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

By modeling these time-dependent probability measures as random objects in the Wasserstein space, we propose a new auto-regressive model for the statistical analysis of multivariate distributional time series. Using the theory of iterated random function systems, results on the second order stationarity of the solution of such a model are provided. We also propose a consistent estimator for the auto-regressive coefficients of this model. Due to the simplex constraints that we impose on the model coefficients, the proposed estimator that is learned under these constraints, naturally has a sparse structure. The sparsity allows the application of the proposed model in learning a graph of temporal dependency from multivariate distributional time series. We explore the numerical performances of our estimation procedure using simulated data. To shed some light on the benefits of our approach for real data analysis, we also apply this methodology to two data sets, respectively made of observations from age distribution in different countries and those from the bike sharing network in Paris.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Time Series Generation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20846v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series generation (TSG) synthesizes realistic sequences and has achieved remarkable success. Among TSG, conditional models generate sequences given observed covariates, however, such models learn observational correlations without considering unobserved confounding. In this work, we propose a causal perspective on conditional TSG and introduce causal time series generation as a new TSG task family, formalized within Pearl's causal ladder, extending beyond observational generation to include interventional and counterfactual settings. To instantiate these tasks, we develop CaTSG, a unified diffusion-based framework with backdoor-adjusted guidance that causally steers sampling toward desired interventions and individual counterfactuals while preserving observational fidelity. Specifically, our method derives causal score functions via backdoor adjustment and the abduction-action-prediction procedure, thus enabling principled support for all three levels of TSG. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that CaTSG achieves superior fidelity and also supporting interventional and counterfactual generation that existing baselines cannot handle. Overall, we propose the causal TSG family and instantiate it with CaTSG, providing an initial proof-of-concept and opening a promising direction toward more reliable simulation under interventions and counterfactual generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distilling Time Series Foundation Models for Efficient Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12785v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series foundation models (TSFMs) deliver strong forecasting performance through large-scale pretraining, but their large parameter sizes make deployment costly. While knowledge distillation offers a natural and effective approach for model compression, techniques developed for general machine learning tasks are not directly applicable to time series forecasting due to the unique characteristics. To address this, we present DistilTS, the first distillation framework specifically designed for TSFMs. DistilTS addresses two key challenges: (1) task difficulty discrepancy, specific to forecasting, where uniform weighting makes optimization dominated by easier short-term horizons, while long-term horizons receive weaker supervision; and (2) architecture discrepancy, a general challenge in distillation, for which we design an alignment mechanism in the time series forecasting. To overcome these issues, DistilTS introduces horizon-weighted objectives to balance learning across horizons, and a temporal alignment strategy that reduces architectural mismatch, enabling compact models. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DistilTS achieves forecasting performance comparable to full-sized TSFMs, while reducing parameters by up to 1/150 and accelerating inference by up to 6000x.

| **[Trend-Adjusted Time Series Models with an Application to Gold Price Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12706v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data play a critical role in various fields, including finance, healthcare, marketing, and engineering. A wide range of techniques (from classical statistical models to neural network-based approaches such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)) have been employed to address time series forecasting challenges. In this paper, we reframe time series forecasting as a two-part task: (1) predicting the trend (directional movement) of the time series at the next time step, and (2) forecasting the quantitative value at the next time step. The trend can be predicted using a binary classifier, while quantitative values can be forecasted using models such as LSTM and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM). Building on this reframing, we propose the Trend-Adjusted Time Series (TATS) model, which adjusts the forecasted values based on the predicted trend provided by the binary classifier. We validate the proposed approach through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation. The TATS model is applied to a volatile financial time series (the daily gold price) with the objective of forecasting the next days price. Experimental results demonstrate that TATS consistently outperforms standard LSTM and Bi-LSTM models by achieving significantly lower forecasting error. In addition, our results indicate that commonly used metrics such as MSE and MAE are insufficient for fully assessing time series model performance. Therefore, we also incorporate trend detection accuracy, which measures how effectively a model captures trends in a time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Forecasting of Climate Policy Uncertainty: The Role of Macro-financial Variables and Google Search Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12276v3)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately forecasting Climate Policy Uncertainty (CPU) is essential for designing climate strategies that balance economic growth with environmental objectives. Elevated CPU levels can delay regulatory implementation, hinder investment in green technologies, and amplify public resistance to policy reforms, particularly during periods of economic stress. Despite the growing literature documenting the economic relevance of CPU, forecasting its evolution and understanding the role of macro-financial drivers in shaping its fluctuations have not been explored. This study addresses this gap by presenting the first effort to forecast CPU and identify its key drivers. We employ various statistical tools to identify macro-financial exogenous drivers, alongside Google search data to capture early public attention to climate policy. Local projection impulse response analysis quantifies the dynamic effects of these variables, revealing that household financial vulnerability, housing market activity, business confidence, credit conditions, and financial market sentiment exert the most substantial impacts. These predictors are incorporated into a Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) framework to produce probabilistic forecasts for both US and Global CPU indices. Extensive experiments and statistical validation demonstrate that BSTS with time-invariant regression coefficients achieves superior forecasting performance. We demonstrate that this performance stems from its variable selection mechanism, which identifies exogenous predictors that are empirically significant and theoretically grounded, as confirmed by the feature importance analysis. From a policy perspective, the findings underscore the importance of adaptive climate policies that remain effective across shifting economic conditions while supporting long-term environmental and growth objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[MOMEMTO: Patch-based Memory Gate Model in Time Series Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18751v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently reconstruction-based deep models have been widely used for time series anomaly detection, but as their capacity and generalization capability increase, these models tend to over-generalize, often reconstructing unseen anomalies accurately. Prior works have attempted to mitigate this by incorporating a memory architecture that stores prototypes of normal patterns. Nevertheless, these approaches suffer from high training costs and have yet to be effectively integrated with time series foundation models (TFMs). To address these challenges, we propose MOMEMTO, an improved variant of TFM for anomaly detection, enhanced with a patch-based memory module to mitigate over-generalization. The memory module is designed to capture representative normal patterns from multiple domains and enables a single model to be jointly fine-tuned across multiple datasets through a multi-domain training strategy. MOMEMTO initializes memory items with latent representations from a pre-trained encoder, organizes them into patch-level units, and updates them via an attention mechanism. We evaluate our method using 23 univariate benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that MOMEMTO, as a single model, achieves higher scores on AUC and VUS metrics compared to baseline methods, and further enhances the performance of its backbone TFM, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[MiCA: A Mobility-Informed Causal Adapter for Lightweight Epidemic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11089v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate forecasting of infectious disease dynamics is critical for public health planning and intervention. Human mobility plays a central role in shaping the spatial spread of epidemics, but mobility data are noisy, indirect, and difficult to integrate reliably with disease records. Meanwhile, epidemic case time series are typically short and reported at coarse temporal resolution. These conditions limit the effectiveness of parameter-heavy mobility-aware forecasters that rely on clean and abundant data. In this work, we propose the Mobility-Informed Causal Adapter (MiCA), a lightweight and architecture-agnostic module for epidemic forecasting. MiCA infers mobility relations through causal discovery and integrates them into temporal forecasting models via gated residual mixing. This design allows lightweight forecasters to selectively exploit mobility-derived spatial structure while remaining robust under noisy and data-limited conditions, without introducing heavy relational components such as graph neural networks or full attention. Extensive experiments on four real-world epidemic datasets, including COVID-19 incidence, COVID-19 mortality, influenza, and dengue, show that MiCA consistently improves lightweight temporal backbones, achieving an average relative error reduction of 7.5\% across forecasting horizons. Moreover, MiCA attains performance competitive with SOTA spatio-temporal models while remaining lightweight.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Promise of Time-Series Foundation Models for Agricultural Forecasting: Evidence from Commodity Prices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06371v2)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting agricultural markets remains challenging due to nonlinear dynamics, structural breaks, and sparse data. A long-standing belief holds that simple time-series methods outperform more advanced alternatives. This paper provides the first systematic evidence that this belief no longer holds with modern time-series foundation models (TSFMs). Using USDA ERS monthly commodity price data from 1997-2025, we evaluate 17 forecasting approaches across four model classes, including traditional time-series, machine learning, deep learning, and five state-of-the-art TSFMs (Chronos, Chronos-2, TimesFM 2.5, Time-MoE, Moirai-2), and construct annual marketing year price predictions to compare with USDA's futures-based season-average price (SAP) forecasts. We show that zero-shot foundation models consistently outperform traditional time-series methods, machine learning, and deep learning architectures trained from scratch in both monthly and annual forecasting. Furthermore, foundation models remarkably outperform USDA's futures-based forecasts on three of four major commodities despite USDA's information advantage from forward-looking futures markets. Time-MoE delivers the largest accuracy gains, achieving 54.9% improvement on wheat and 18.5% improvement on corn relative to USDA ERS benchmarks on recent data (2017-2024 excluding COVID). These results point to a paradigm shift in agricultural forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Expressivity and Scalability with Adaptive Unitary SSMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05238v3)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has revealed that state space models (SSMs), while efficient for long-sequence processing, are fundamentally limited in their ability to represent formal languages-particularly due to time-invariant and real-valued recurrence structures. In this work, we draw inspiration from adaptive and structured dynamics observed in biological neural systems and introduce the Adaptive Unitary State Space Model (AUSSM): a novel class of SSMs that leverages skew-symmetric, input-dependent recurrence to achieve unitary evolution and high expressive power. Using algebraic automata theory, we prove that AUSSM can perform modulo counting and simulate solvable group automata at precision logarithmically bounded in the input length, enabling SSMs to model a broad class of regular languages out of reach for other SSM architectures. To overcome the practical inefficiencies of adaptive recurrence, we develop a separable convolution formulation and a CUDA implementation that enables scalable parallel training. Empirically, we show that AUSSM and its hybrid variant-interleaved with Mamba-outperform prior SSMs on formal algorithmic tasks such as parity and modular arithmetic, and achieve competent performance on real-world long time-series classification benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that adaptive unitary recurrence provides a powerful and efficient inductive bias for both symbolic and continuous sequence modeling.

| **[On the Identification of Temporally Causal Representation with Instantaneous Dependence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15325v4)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporally causal representation learning aims to identify the latent causal process from time series observations, but most methods require the assumption that the latent causal processes do not have instantaneous relations. Although some recent methods achieve identifiability in the instantaneous causality case, they require either interventions on the latent variables or grouping of the observations, which are in general difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose an \textbf{ID}entification framework for instantane\textbf{O}us \textbf{L}atent dynamics (\textbf{IDOL}) by imposing a sparse influence constraint that the latent causal processes have sparse time-delayed and instantaneous relations. Specifically, we establish identifiability results of the latent causal process based on sufficient variability and the sparse influence constraint by employing contextual information of time series data. Based on these theories, we incorporate a temporally variational inference architecture to estimate the latent variables and a gradient-based sparsity regularization to identify the latent causal process. Experimental results on simulation datasets illustrate that our method can identify the latent causal process. Furthermore, evaluations on multiple human motion forecasting benchmarks with instantaneous dependencies indicate the effectiveness of our method in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Influence: Tracing Interdependencies Across Time and Features in Clinical Predictive Modelings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09895v3)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling clinical time-series data is hampered by the challenge of capturing latent, time-varying dependencies among features. State-of-the-art approaches often rely on black-box mechanisms or simple aggregation, failing to explicitly model how the influence of one clinical variable propagates through others over time. We propose $\textbf{Chain-of-Influence (CoI)}$, an interpretable deep learning framework that constructs an explicit, time-unfolded graph of feature interactions. CoI enables the tracing of influence pathways, providing a granular audit trail that shows how any feature at any time contributes to the final prediction, both directly and through its influence on other variables. We evaluate CoI on mortality and disease progression tasks using the MIMIC-IV dataset and a chronic kidney disease cohort. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance (AUROC of 0.960 on CKD progression and 0.950 on ICU mortality), with deletion-based sensitivity analyses confirming that CoI's learned attributions faithfully reflect its decision process. Through case studies, we demonstrate that CoI uncovers clinically meaningful, patient-specific patterns of disease progression, offering enhanced transparency into the temporal and cross-feature dependencies that inform clinical decision-making.</p></details> |  |

Discrete tokenizations (raw values, patches, finite differences) can be brittle in low signal-to-noise regimes, especially when downstream objectives impose asymmetric penalties that rationally encourage abstention. We introduce Kinematic Tokenization, an optimization-based continuous-time representation that reconstructs an explicit spline from noisy measurements and tokenizes local spline coefficients (position, velocity, acceleration, jerk). This is applied to financial time series data in the form of asset prices in conjunction with trading volume profiles. Across a multi-asset daily-equity testbed, we use a risk-averse asymmetric classification objective as a stress test for learnability. Under this objective, several discrete baselines collapse to an absorbing cash policy (the Liquidation Equilibrium), whereas the continuous spline tokens sustain calibrated, non-trivial action distributions and stable policies. These results suggest that explicit continuous-time tokens can improve the learnability and calibration of selective decision policies in noisy time series under abstention-inducing losses.</p></details> | Pre-print, 19 pages |
| **[Evaluating Large Language Models for Time Series Anomaly Detection in Aerospace Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12448v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is essential for ensuring the safety and reliability of aerospace software systems. Although large language models (LLMs) provide a promising training-free alternative to unsupervised approaches, their effectiveness in aerospace settings remains under-examined because of complex telemetry, misaligned evaluation metrics, and the absence of domain knowledge. To address this gap, we introduce ATSADBench, the first benchmark for aerospace TSAD. ATSADBench comprises nine tasks that combine three pattern-wise anomaly types, univariate and multivariate signals, and both in-loop and out-of-loop feedback scenarios, yielding 108,000 data points. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art open-source LLMs under two paradigms: Direct, which labels anomalies within sliding windows, and Prediction-Based, which detects anomalies from prediction errors. To reflect operational needs, we reformulate evaluation at the window level and propose three user-oriented metrics: Alarm Accuracy (AA), Alarm Latency (AL), and Alarm Contiguity (AC), which quantify alarm correctness, timeliness, and credibility. We further examine two enhancement strategies, few-shot learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), to inject domain knowledge. The evaluation results show that (1) LLMs perform well on univariate tasks but struggle with multivariate telemetry, (2) their AA and AC on multivariate tasks approach random guessing, (3) few-shot learning provides modest gains whereas RAG offers no significant improvement, and (4) in practice LLMs can detect true anomaly onsets yet sometimes raise false alarms, which few-shot prompting mitigates but RAG exacerbates. These findings offer guidance for future LLM-based TSAD in aerospace software.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ASE 2025</p></details> |

While Transformer-based models are effective for sequence modeling, their quadratic complexity limits scalability in Near-RT RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) analytics. This paper investigates a post-Transformer design paradigm for efficient radio telemetry forecasting. We propose a quantum-inspired many-body state-space tensor network that replaces self-attention with stable structured state-space dynamics kernels, enabling linear-time sequence modeling. Tensor-network factorizations in the form of Tensor Train (TT) / Matrix Product State (MPS) representations are employed to reduce parameterization and data movement in both input projections and prediction heads, while lightweight channel gating and mixing layers capture non-stationary cross-Key Performance Indicator (KPI) dependencies. The proposed model is instantiated as an agentic perceive-predict xApp and evaluated on a bespoke O-RAN KPI time-series dataset comprising 59,441 sliding windows across 13 KPIs, using Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) forecasting as a representative use case. Our proposed Linear Quantum-Inspired State-Space (LiQSS) model is 10.8x-15.8x smaller and approximately 1.4x faster than prior structured state-space baselines. Relative to Transformer-based models, LiQSS achieves up to a 155x reduction in parameter count and up to 2.74x faster inference, without sacrificing forecasting accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[ADMM-Based Training for Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05527v2)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained momentum due to their high potential in time-series processing combined with minimal energy consumption. However, they still lack a dedicated and efficient training algorithm. The popular backpropagation with surrogate gradients, adapted from stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-derived algorithms, has several drawbacks when used as an optimizer for SNNs. Specifically, the approximation introduced by the use of surrogate gradients leads to numerical imprecision, poor tracking of SNN firing times at training time, and, in turn, poor scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel SNN training method based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Our ADMM-based training aims to solve the problem of the SNN step function's non-differentiability by taking an entirely new approach with respect to gradient backpropagation. For the first time, we formulate the SNN training problem as an ADMM-based iterative optimization, derive closed-form updates, and empirically show the optimizer's convergence, its great potential, and discuss future and promising research directions to improve the method to different layer types and deeper architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>\c{op...</summary><p>\c{opyright} 2026 IEEE.

| **[IceWatch: Forecasting Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) using Multimodal Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12330v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) pose a serious threat in high mountain regions. They are hazardous to communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems further downstream. The classical methods of GLOF detection and prediction have so far mainly relied on hydrological modeling, threshold-based lake monitoring, and manual satellite image analysis. These approaches suffer from several drawbacks: slow updates, reliance on manual labor, and losses in accuracy when clouds interfere and/or lack on-site data. To tackle these challenges, we present IceWatch: a novel deep learning framework for GLOF prediction that incorporates both spatial and temporal perspectives. The vision component, RiskFlow, of IceWatch deals with Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery using a CNN-based classifier and predicts GLOF events based on the spatial patterns of snow, ice, and meltwater. Its tabular counterpart confirms this prediction by considering physical dynamics. TerraFlow models glacier velocity from NASA ITS_LIVE time series while TempFlow forecasts near-surface temperature from MODIS LST records; both are trained on long-term observational archives and integrated via harmonized preprocessing and synchronization to enable multimodal, physics-informed GLOF prediction. Both together provide cross-validation, which will improve the reliability and interpretability of GLOF detection. This system ensures strong predictive performance, rapid data processing for real-time use, and robustness to noise and missing information. IceWatch paves the way for automatic, scalable GLOF warning systems. It also holds potential for integration with diverse sensor inputs and global glacier monitoring activities.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often rely on computationally expensive sampling or restrictive parametric assumptions to characterize future distributions, which limits predictive performance and introduces distributional mismatch. To address these challenges, this paper presents TimeGMM, a novel probabilistic forecasting framework based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) that captures complex future distributions in a single forward pass. A key component is GMM-adapted Reversible Instance Normalization (GRIN), a novel module designed to dynamically adapt to temporal-probabilistic distribution shifts. The framework integrates a dedicated Temporal Encoder (TE-Module) with a Conditional Temporal-Probabilistic Decoder (CTPD-Module) to jointly capture temporal dependencies and mixture distribution parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeGMM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving maximum improvements of 22.48\% in CRPS and 21.23\% in NMAE.</p></details> |  |
| **[FTSCommDetector: Discovering Behavioral Communities through Temporal Synchronization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00014v3)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Why do trillion-dollar tech giants AAPL and MSFT diverge into different response patterns during market disruptions despite identical sector classifications? This paradox reveals a fundamental limitation: traditional community detection methods fail to capture synchronization-desynchronization patterns where entities move independently yet align during critical moments. To this end, we introduce FTSCommDetector, implementing our Temporal Coherence Architecture (TCA) to discover similar and dissimilar communities in continuous multivariate time series. Unlike existing methods that process each timestamp independently, causing unstable community assignments and missing evolving relationships, our approach maintains coherence through dual-scale encoding and static topology with dynamic attention. Furthermore, we establish information-theoretic foundations demonstrating how scale separation maximizes complementary information and introduce Normalized Temporal Profiles (NTP) for scale-invariant evaluation. As a result, FTSCommDetector achieves consistent improvements across four diverse financial markets (SP100, SP500, SP1000, Nikkei 225), with gains ranging from 3.5% to 11.1% over the strongest baselines. The method demonstrates remarkable robustness with only 2% performance variation across window sizes from 60 to 120 days, making dataset-specific tuning unnecessary, providing practical insights for portfolio construction and risk management.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wavelet-Driven Masked Multiscale Reconstruction for PPG Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12215v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wearable foundation models have the potential to transform digital health by learning transferable representations from large-scale biosignals collected in everyday settings. While recent progress has been made in large-scale pretraining, most approaches overlook the spectral structure of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, wherein physiological rhythms unfold across multiple frequency bands. Motivated by the insight that many downstream health-related tasks depend on multi-resolution features spanning fine-grained waveform morphology to global rhythmic dynamics, we introduce Masked Multiscale Reconstruction (MMR) for PPG representation learning - a self-supervised pretraining framework that explicitly learns from hierarchical time-frequency scales of PPG data. The pretraining task is designed to reconstruct randomly masked out coefficients obtained from a wavelet-based multiresolution decomposition of PPG signals, forcing the transformer encoder to integrate information across temporal and spectral scales. We pretrain our model with MMR using ~17 million unlabeled 10-second PPG segments from ~32,000 smartwatch users. On 17 of 19 diverse health-related tasks, MMR trained on large-scale wearable PPG data improves over or matches state-of-the-art open-source PPG foundation models, time-series foundation models, and other self-supervised baselines. Extensive analysis of our learned embeddings and systematic ablations underscores the value of wavelet-based representations, showing that they capture robust and physiologically-grounded features. Together, these results highlight the potential of MMR as a step toward generalizable PPG foundation models.</p></details> |  |

To interpret forecasting models agnostic to the types of layers across state-of-the-art model families, we introduce Horizon Activation Mapping (HAM), a visual interpretability technique inspired by grad-CAM that uses gradient norm averages to study the horizon's subseries where grad-CAM studies attention maps over image data. We introduce causal and anti-causal modes to calculate gradient update norm averages across subseries at every timestep and lines of proportionality signifying uniform distributions of the norm averages. Optimization landscape studies with respect to changes in batch sizes, early stopping, train-val-test splits, architectural choices, univariate forecasting and dropouts are studied with respect to performances and subseries in HAM. Interestingly, batch size based differences in activities seem to indicate potential for existence of an exponential approximation across them per epoch relative to each other. Multivariate forecasting models including MLP-based CycleNet, N-Linear, N-HITS, self attention-based FEDformer, Pyraformer, SSM-based SpaceTime and diffusion-based Multi-Resolution DDPM over different horizon sizes trained over the ETTm2 dataset are used for HAM plots in this study. NHITS' neural approximation theorem and SpaceTime's exponential autoregressive activities have been attributed to trends in HAM plots over their training, validation and test sets. In general, HAM can be used for granular model selection, validation set choices and comparisons across different neural network model families.</p></details> |  |
| **[One-Shot Price Forecasting with Covariate-Guided Experts under Privacy Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11977v1)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting in power systems often involves multivariate time series with complex dependencies and strict privacy constraints across regions. Traditional forecasting methods require significant expert knowledge and struggle to generalize across diverse deployment scenarios. Recent advancements in pre-trained time series models offer new opportunities, but their zero-shot performance on domain-specific tasks remains limited. To address these challenges, we propose a novel MoE Encoder module that augments pretrained forecasting models by injecting a sparse mixture-of-experts layer between tokenization and encoding. This design enables two key capabilities: (1) trans forming multivariate forecasting into an expert-guided univariate task, allowing the model to effectively capture inter-variable relations, and (2) supporting localized training and lightweight parameter sharing in federated settings where raw data cannot be exchanged. Extensive experiments on public multivariate datasets demonstrate that MoE-Encoder significantly improves forecasting accuracy compared to strong baselines. We further simulate federated environments and show that transferring only MoE-Encoder parameters allows efficient adaptation to new regions, with minimal performance degradation. Our findings suggest that MoE-Encoder provides a scalable and privacy-aware extension to foundation time series models.</p></details> |  |

Without structured oversight, such changes can degrade model behavior, increase operational cost, and reduce the usefulness of deployed systems. Although Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) streamlines the lifecycle of ML models, it provides limited support for addressing runtime uncertainties that influence the longer term sustainability of MLS. To support continued viability, these systems need a mechanism that detects when execution drifts outside acceptable bounds and adjusts system behavior in response. Despite the growing interest in sustainable and self-adaptive MLS, there has been limited work towards exemplars that allow researchers to study these challenges in MLOps pipelines. This paper presents Harmonica, a self-adaptation exemplar built on the HarmonE approach, designed to enable the sustainable operation of such pipelines. Harmonica introduces structured adaptive control through MAPE-K loop, separating high-level adaptation policy from low-level tactic execution. It continuously monitors sustainability metrics, evaluates them against dynamic adaptation boundaries, and automatically triggers architectural tactics when thresholds are violated. We demonstrate the tool through case studies in time series regression and computer vision, examining its ability to improve system stability and reduce manual intervention. The results show that Harmonica offers a practical and reusable foundation for enabling adaptive behavior in MLS that rely on MLOps pipelines for sustained operation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to SEAMS 2026 Artifact Track</p></details> |

However, their performance in synthesizing treasury futures data is still underexplored. This work emphasizes the characteristics of treasury futures data, including its low volume, market dependencies, and the grouped correlations among multivariables. To overcome these challenges, we propose TF-CoDiT, the first DiT framework for language-controlled treasury futures synthesis. To facilitate low-data learning, TF-CoDiT adapts the standard DiT by transforming multi-channel 1-D time series into Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) coefficient matrices. A U-shape VAE is proposed to encode cross-channel dependencies hierarchically into a latent variable and bridge the latent and DWT spaces through decoding, thereby enabling latent diffusion generation. To derive prompts that cover essential conditions, we introduce the Financial Market Attribute Protocol (FinMAP) - a multi-level description system that standardizes daily$/$periodical market dynamics by recognizing 17$/$23 economic indicators from 7/8 perspectives. In our experiments, we gather four types of treasury futures data covering the period from 2015 to 2025, and define data synthesis tasks with durations ranging from one week to four months. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TF-CoDiT can produce highly authentic data with errors at most 0.433 (MSE) and 0.453 (MAE) to the ground-truth. Further studies evidence the robustness of TF-CoDiT across contracts and temporal horizons.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shapelets-Enriched Selective Forecasting using Time Series Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11821v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models have recently gained a lot of attention due to their ability to model complex time series data encompassing different domains including traffic, energy, and weather. Although they exhibit strong average zero-shot performance on forecasting tasks, their predictions on certain critical regions of the data are not always reliable, limiting their usability in real-world applications, especially when data exhibits unique trends. In this paper, we propose a selective forecasting framework to identify these critical segments of time series using shapelets. We learn shapelets using shift-invariant dictionary learning on the validation split of the target domain dataset. Utilizing distance-based similarity to these shapelets, we facilitate the user to selectively discard unreliable predictions and be informed of the model's realistic capabilities. Empirical results on diverse benchmark time series datasets demonstrate that our approach leveraging both zero-shot and full-shot fine-tuned models reduces the overall error by an average of 22.17% for zero-shot and 22.62% for full-shot fine-tuned model. Furthermore, our approach using zero-shot and full-shot fine-tuned models, also outperforms its random selection counterparts by up to 21.41% and 21.43% on one of the datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the AAAI-26 Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Time Series Analysis (AI4TS)</p></details> |
| **[Predicting Tail-Risk Escalation in IDS Alert Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14299v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network defenders face a steady stream of attacks, observed as raw Intrusion Detection System (IDS) alerts. The sheer volume of alerts demands prioritization, typically based on high-level risk classifications. This work expands the scope of risk measurement by examining alerts not only through their technical characteristics but also by examining and classifying their temporal patterns. One critical issue in responding to intrusion alerts is determining whether an alert is part of an escalating attack pattern or an opportunistic scan. To identify the former, we apply extreme-regime forecasting methods from financial modeling to IDS data. Extreme-regime forecasting is designed to identify likely future high-impact events or significant shifts in system behavior. Using these methods, we examine attack patterns by computing per-minute alert intensity, volatility, and a short-term momentum measure derived from weighted moving averages. We evaluate the efficacy of a supervised learning model for forecasting future escalation patterns using these derived features. The trained model identifies future high-intensity attacks and demonstrates strong predictive performance, achieving approximately 91\% accuracy, 89\% recall, and 98\% precision. Our contributions provide a temporal measurement framework for identifying future high-intensity attacks and demonstrate the presence of predictive early-warning signals within the temporal structure of IDS alert streams. We describe our methods in sufficient detail to enable reproduction using other IDS datasets. In addition, we make the trained models openly available to support further research. Finally, we introduce an interpretable visualization that enables defenders to generate early predictive warnings of elevated volumetric arrival risk.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages.

| **[Wetland mapping from sparse annotations with satellite image time series and temporal-aware segment anything model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11400v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate wetland mapping is essential for ecosystem monitoring, yet dense pixel-level annotation is prohibitively expensive and practical applications usually rely on sparse point labels, under which existing deep learning models perform poorly, while strong seasonal and inter-annual wetland dynamics further render single-date imagery inadequate and lead to significant mapping errors; although foundation models such as SAM show promising generalization from point prompts, they are inherently designed for static images and fail to model temporal information, resulting in fragmented masks in heterogeneous wetlands. To overcome these limitations, we propose WetSAM, a SAM-based framework that integrates satellite image time series for wetland mapping from sparse point supervision through a dual-branch design, where a temporally prompted branch extends SAM with hierarchical adapters and dynamic temporal aggregation to disentangle wetland characteristics from phenological variability, and a spatial branch employs a temporally constrained region-growing strategy to generate reliable dense pseudo-labels, while a bidirectional consistency regularization jointly optimizes both branches. Extensive experiments across eight global regions of approximately 5,000 km2 each demonstrate that WetSAM substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average F1-score of 85.58%, and delivering accurate and structurally consistent wetland segmentation with minimal labeling effort, highlighting its strong generalization capability and potential for scalable, low-cost, high-resolution wetland mapping.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a comprehensive dynamics dataset for the Mini Wheelbot, an open-source, quasi-symmetric balancing reaction wheel unicycle. The dataset provides 1 kHz synchronized data encompassing all onboard sensor readings, state estimates, ground-truth poses from a motion capture system, and third-person video logs. To ensure data diversity, we include experiments across multiple hardware instances and surfaces using various control paradigms, including pseudo-random binary excitation, nonlinear model predictive control, and reinforcement learning agents. We include several example applications in dynamics model learning, state estimation, and time-series classification to illustrate common robotics algorithms that can be benchmarked on our dataset.</p></details> |  |

As systems evolve toward automation, models must operate on edge devices (e.g., PLCs, microcontrollers) with strict constraints on latency and memory, limiting parameters to a few thousand. Conventional deep architectures are often impractical here. We propose the Fourier-Efficient Adaptive Temporal Hierarchy Forecaster (FEATHer) for accurate long-term forecasting under severe limits. FEATHer introduces: (i) ultra-lightweight multiscale decomposition into frequency pathways; (ii) a shared Dense Temporal Kernel using projection-depthwise convolution-projection without recurrence or attention; (iii) frequency-aware branch gating that adaptively fuses representations based on spectral characteristics; and (iv) a Sparse Period Kernel reconstructing outputs via period-wise downsampling to capture seasonality. FEATHer maintains a compact architecture (as few as 400 parameters) while outperforming baselines. Across eight benchmarks, it achieves the best ranking, recording 60 first-place results with an average rank of 2.05. These results demonstrate that reliable long-range forecasting is achievable on constrained edge hardware, offering a practical direction for industrial real-time inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI)</p></details> |

We investigate the recalibration in EEG networks that causes this change and the track the timeline of changes in the auditory processing pathway. Our results obtained using network analysis, non-stationary time series analysis and multivariate pattern classification show that recalibration takes place early in the auditory processing pathway and the after-effect decays with time after exposure to the illusion.</p></details> |  |

| **[Explaining Time Series Classifiers with PHAR: Rule Extraction and Fusion from Post-hoc Attributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01687v4)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explaining machine learning (ML) models for time series (TS) classification remains challenging due to the difficulty of interpreting raw time series and the high dimensionality of the input space. We introduce PHAR--Post-hoc Attribution Rules--a unified framework that transforms numeric feature attributions from post-hoc, instance-wise explainers (e.g. LIME, SHAP) into structured, human-readable rules. These rules define human-readable intervals that indicate where and when decision-relevant segments occur and can enhance model transparency by localizing threshold-based conditions on the raw series. PHAR performs comparably to native rule-based methods, such as Anchor, while scaling more efficiently to long TS sequences and achieving broader instance coverage. A dedicated rule fusion step consolidates rule sets using strategies like weighted selection and lasso-based refinement, balancing key quality metrics: coverage, confidence, and simplicity. This fusion ensures each instance receives a concise and unambiguous rule, improving both explanation fidelity and consistency. We further introduce visualization techniques to illustrate specificity-generalization trade-offs in the derived rules. PHAR resolves conflicting and overlapping explanations--a common effect of the Rashomon phenomenon--into coherent, domain-adaptable insights. Comprehensive experiments on UCR/UEA Time Series Classification Archive demonstrate that PHAR may improve interpretability, decision transparency, and practical applicability for TS classification tasks by providing concise, human-readable rules aligned with model predictions.</p></details> |  |

| **[Virtual Traffic Police: Large Language Model-Augmented Traffic Signal Control for Unforeseen Incidents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15816v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptive traffic signal control (TSC) has demonstrated strong effectiveness in managing dynamic traffic flows. However, conventional methods often struggle when unforeseen traffic incidents occur (e.g., accidents and road maintenance), which typically require labor-intensive and inefficient manual interventions by traffic police officers. Large Language Models (LLMs) appear to be a promising solution thanks to their remarkable reasoning and generalization capabilities. Nevertheless, existing works often propose to replace existing TSC systems with LLM-based systems, which can be (i) unreliable due to the inherent hallucinations of LLMs and (ii) costly due to the need for system replacement. To address the issues of existing works, we propose a hierarchical framework that augments existing TSC systems with LLMs, whereby a virtual traffic police agent at the upper level dynamically fine-tunes selected parameters of signal controllers at the lower level in response to real-time traffic incidents. To enhance domain-specific reliability in response to unforeseen traffic incidents, we devise a self-refined traffic language retrieval system (TLRS), whereby retrieval-augmented generation is employed to draw knowledge from a tailored traffic language database that encompasses traffic conditions and controller operation principles. Moreover, we devise an LLM-based verifier to update the TLRS continuously over the reasoning process. Our results show that LLMs can serve as trustworthy virtual traffic police officers that can adapt conventional TSC methods to unforeseen traffic incidents with significantly improved operational efficiency and reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[TempoNet: Learning Realistic Communication and Timing Patterns for Network Traffic Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15663v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic network traffic simulation is critical for evaluating intrusion detection systems, stress-testing network protocols, and constructing high-fidelity environments for cybersecurity training. While attack traffic can often be layered into training environments using red-teaming or replay methods, generating authentic benign background traffic remains a core challenge -- particularly in simulating the complex temporal and communication dynamics of real-world networks. This paper introduces TempoNet, a novel generative model that combines multi-task learning with multi-mark temporal point processes to jointly model inter-arrival times and all packet- and flow-header fields. TempoNet captures fine-grained timing patterns and higher-order correlations such as host-pair behavior and seasonal trends, addressing key limitations of GAN-, LLM-, and Bayesian-based methods that fail to reproduce structured temporal variation. TempoNet produces temporally consistent, high-fidelity traces, validated on real-world datasets. Furthermore, we show that intrusion detection models trained on TempoNet-generated background traffic perform comparably to those trained on real data, validating its utility for real-world security applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[TransportAgents: a multi-agents LLM framework for traffic accident severity prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15519v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of traffic crash severity is critical for improving emergency response and public safety planning. Although recent large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their single-agent architectures often struggle with heterogeneous, domain-specific crash data and tend to generate biased or unstable predictions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes TransportAgents, a hybrid multi-agent framework that integrates category-specific LLM reasoning with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) integration module. Each specialized agent focuses on a particular subset of traffic information, such as demographics, environmental context, or incident details, to produce intermediate severity assessments that are subsequently fused into a unified prediction. Extensive experiments on two complementary U.S. datasets, the Consumer Product Safety Risk Management System (CPSRMS) and the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), demonstrate that TransportAgents consistently outperforms both traditional machine learning and advanced LLM-based baselines. Across three representative backbones, including closed-source models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o, as well as open-source models such as LLaMA-3.3, the framework exhibits strong robustness, scalability, and cross-dataset generalizability. A supplementary distributional analysis further shows that TransportAgents produces more balanced and well-calibrated severity predictions than standard single-agent LLM approaches, highlighting its interpretability and reliability for safety-critical decision support applications.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel framework that transforms a single frontal-view camera image into a concise natural language description, effectively capturing spatial layouts, semantic relationships, and driving-relevant cues. The proposed model leverages a hybrid attention mechanism to enhance spatial and semantic feature extraction and integrates these features to generate contextually rich and detailed scene descriptions. To address the limited availability of specialized datasets in this domain, a new dataset derived from the BDD100K dataset has been developed, with comprehensive guidelines provided for its construction. Furthermore, the study offers an in-depth discussion of relevant evaluation metrics, identifying the most appropriate measures for this task. Extensive quantitative evaluations using metrics such as CIDEr and SPICE, complemented by human judgment assessments, demonstrate that the proposed model achieves strong performance and effectively fulfills its intended objectives on the newly developed dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at Computer Vision and Image Understanding (submitted July 25, 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Back2Color: Domain-Adaptive Synthetic-to-Real Monocular Depth Estimation for Dynamic Traffic Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07741v7)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate monocular depth estimation is a fundamental component of vision-based perception systems in intelligent transportation applications. Despite recent progress, unsupervised monocular approaches still suffer from significant performance degradation in real-world traffic scenes due to synthetic-to-real domain gaps and the presence of dynamic, non-rigid objects such as vehicles and pedestrians. In this paper, we propose Back2Color, a robust unsupervised monocular depth estimation framework that addresses these challenges through domain adaptation and uncertainty-aware fusion. Specifically, Back2Color proposes a bidirectional depth-to-color transformation strategy that learns appearance mappings from real-world driving data and applies them to synthetic depth maps, thereby constructing training samples with realistic color appearance and paired synthetic depth. In this way, the proposed approach effectively reduces the domain gap between simulated and real traffic scenes, enabling the depth prediction network to learn more stable and generalizable priors. To further improve robustness under dynamic environments, we propose an auto-learning uncertainty temporal-spatial fusion (Auto-UTSF) module, which adaptively fuses complementary temporal and spatial cues by estimating pixel-wise uncertainty, enabling reliable depth prediction in the presence of moving objects and occlusions. Extensive experiments on challenging urban driving benchmarks, including KITTI and Cityscapes, demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing unsupervised monocular depth estimation approaches, particularly in dynamic traffic scenarios, while maintaining high computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we adopt a transfer learning setup best known from computer vision. We first pretrain an embedding model on a complex task with a large number of classes and then transfer it to seven established TC datasets. The pretraining task is recognition of SNI domains in encrypted QUIC traffic, which in itself is a challenge for network monitoring due to the growing adoption of TLS Encrypted Client Hello. Our training pipeline -- featuring a disjoint class setup, ArcFace loss function, and a modern deep learning architecture -- aims to produce universal embeddings applicable across tasks. A transfer method based on model fine-tuning surpassed SOTA performance on nine of ten downstream TC tasks, with an average improvement of 6.4%. Furthermore, a comparison with a baseline method using raw packet sequences revealed unexpected findings with potential implications for the broader TC field. We released the model architecture, trained weights, and codebase for transfer learning experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[No Traffic to Cry: Traffic-Oblivious Link Deactivation for Green Traffic Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13087v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As internet traffic grows, the underlying infrastructure consumes increasing amounts of energy. During off-peak hours, large parts of the networks remain underutilized, presenting significant potential for energy savings. Existing Green Traffic Engineering approaches attempt to leverage this potential by switching off those parts of the networks that are not required for the routing of specific traffic matrices. When traffic changes, the approaches need to adapt rapidly, which is hard to achieve given the complexity of the problem. We take a fundamentally different approach: instead of considering a specific traffic matrix, we rely on a traffic-oblivious routing scheme. We discuss the NP-hard problem of activating as few connections as possible while still guaranteeing that any down-scaled traffic matrix $\varrho\cdot T$ can be routed, where $\varrho \in (0,1)$ and $T$ is any traffic matrix routable in the original network. We present a $\max(\frac{1}{\varrho\cdotλ_{\text{min}}},2)$-approximation algorithm for this problem, with $λ_{\text{min}}$ denoting the minimum number of connections between any two connected routers. Additionally, we propose two post-processing heuristics to further improve solution quality. Our evaluation shows that we can quickly generate near-optimal solutions. By design, our method avoids the need for frequent reconfigurations and offers a promising direction to achieve practical energy savings in backbone networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appears in the Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications 2026 (INFOCOM 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Traffic Collisions: Temporal Patterns and Severity-Weighted Hotspot Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12548v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding traffic collision patterns is of high importance for effective road safety planning in fast-growing urban environments. This study examines the temporal and spatial patterns of traffic collisions in Dubai, UAE, with a particular focus on collision severity. To this end, traffic collision records from November 2024 to June 2025 were analyzed to examine hourly, daily, and monthly variations in collision frequency and severity for both overall traffic collisions and pedestrian-related accidents. Temporal associations with severity were evaluated using chi-square tests and Cramer's V, while spatial patterns were analyzed using severity-weighted hotspot analysis based on the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic, complemented by inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation. The results show a clear temporal variation in overall collision frequency and severity, with higher collision frequencies during evening and nighttime periods with 44% higher probability of high-severity outcomes at night compared to the afternoon. On the other hand, pedestrian-related accidents showed a distinct temporal profile, characterized by higher occurrence during late-evening hours and relatively limited variation across days of the week and months. Spatial analysis identified statistically significant severity hotspots for overall collisions in the northern and northwestern parts of Dubai and along the Al Ain-Dubai Highway, while pedestrian severity hotspots were concentrated near industrial areas in the southwestern region. Several policy measures are proposed based on the findings including, reducing nighttime speed limits, enhancing automated enforcement, improving roadway lighting, and implementing pedestrian-focused treatments in statistically significant hotspots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automating Traffic Monitoring with SHM Sensor Networks via Vision-Supervised Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19023v3)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bridges, as critical components of civil infrastructure, are increasingly affected by deterioration, making reliable traffic monitoring essential for assessing their remaining service life. Among operational loads, traffic load plays a pivotal role, and recent advances in deep learning - particularly in computer vision (CV) - have enabled progress toward continuous, automated monitoring. However, CV-based approaches suffer from limitations, including privacy concerns and sensitivity to lighting conditions, while traditional non-vision-based methods often lack flexibility in deployment and validation. To bridge this gap, we propose a fully automated deep-learning pipeline for continuous traffic monitoring using structural health monitoring (SHM) sensor networks. Our approach integrates CV-assisted high-resolution dataset generation with supervised training and inference, leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture the spatial structure and interdependence of sensor data. By transferring knowledge from CV outputs to SHM sensors, the proposed framework enables sensor networks to achieve comparable accuracy of vision-based systems, with minimal human intervention. Applied to accelerometer and strain gauge data in a real-world case study, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with classification accuracies of 99% for light vehicles and 94% for heavy vehicles.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods struggle to address the challenges of poor image quality and insufficient information under low-light conditions, leading to a decline in detection accuracy and affecting driving safety. To address this issue, we propose YOLO-LLTS, an end-to-end real-time traffic sign detection algorithm specifically designed for low-light environments. YOLO-LLTS introduces three main contributions: the HRFM-SOD module retains more information about distant or tiny traffic signs compared to traditional methods; the MFIA module interacts features with different receptive fields to improve information utilization; the PGFE module enhances detection accuracy by improving brightness, edges, contrast, and supplementing detail information. Additionally, we construct a new dataset, the Chinese Nighttime Traffic Sign Sample Set (CNTSSS), covering diverse nighttime scenarios. Experiments show that YOLO-LLTS achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous best methods by 2.7% mAP50 and 1.6% mAP50:95 on TT100K-night, 1.3% mAP50 and 1.9% mAP50:95 on CNTSSS, 7.5% mAP50 and 9.8% mAP50:95 on GTSDB-night, and superior results on CCTSDB2021.

However, during the initial stage of CAV deployment, the sparse distribution of CAVs among human-driven vehicles reduces the likelihood of forming effective cooperative platoons. To address this challenge, this study proposes a hybrid multi-agent lane change decision model aimed at increasing CAV participation in cooperative platooning and maximizing its associated benefits. The proposed model employs the QMIX framework, integrating traffic data processed through a convolutional neural network (CNN-QMIX). This architecture addresses a critical issue in dynamic traffic scenarios by enabling CAVs to make optimal decisions irrespective of the varying number of CAVs present in mixed traffic. Additionally, a trajectory planner and a model predictive controller are designed to ensure smooth and safe lane-change execution. The proposed model is trained and evaluated within a microsimulation environment under varying CAV market penetration rates. The results demonstrate that the proposed model efficiently manages fluctuating traffic agent numbers, significantly outperforming the baseline rule-based models. Notably, it enhances cooperative platooning rates up to 26.2\%, showcasing its potential to optimize CAV cooperation and traffic dynamics during the early stage of deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> |

Although CNN has shown strong capability to extract semantics from raw pixels, its capacity to capture spatial relationships of pixels across rows and columns of an image is not fully explored. These relationships are important to learn semantic objects with strong shape priors but weak appearance coherences, such as traffic lanes, which are often occluded or not even painted on the road surface as shown in Fig. 1 (a). In this paper, we propose Spatial CNN (SCNN), which generalizes traditional deep layer-by-layer convolutions to slice-byslice convolutions within feature maps, thus enabling message passings between pixels across rows and columns in a layer. Such SCNN is particular suitable for long continuous shape structure or large objects, with strong spatial relationship but less appearance clues, such as traffic lanes, poles, and wall. We apply SCNN on a newly released very challenging traffic lane detection dataset and Cityscapse dataset. The results show that SCNN could learn the spatial relationship for structure output and significantly improves the performance. We show that SCNN outperforms the recurrent neural network (RNN) based ReNet and MRF+CNN (MRFNet) in the lane detection dataset by 8.7% and 4.6% respectively. Moreover, our SCNN won the 1st place on the TuSimple Benchmark Lane Detection Challenge, with an accuracy of 96.53%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2018</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate the following complementary formulations of inverse game-theoretic learning: (i) a Closed-form Correlated Equilibrium Maximum-Likelihood estimator (CE-ML) specialized for $2\times2$ games; and (ii) a Logit Best Response Maximum-Likelihood estimator (LBR-ML) that captures long-run adaptation dynamics via stochastic response processes. Together, these approaches span the spectrum between static equilibrium consistency and dynamic behavioral realism. We evaluate them on synthetic "chicken-dare" games and traffic-interaction scenarios simulated in SUMO, comparing parameter recovery and distributional fit. Results reveal clear trade-offs between interpretability, computational tractability, and behavioral expressiveness across models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Meta Dynamic Graph for Traffic Flow Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10328v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic flow prediction is a typical spatio-temporal prediction problem and has a wide range of applications. The core challenge lies in modeling the underlying complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Various methods have been proposed, and recent studies show that the modeling of dynamics is useful to meet the core challenge. While handling spatial dependencies and temporal dependencies using separate base model structures may hinder the modeling of spatio-temporal correlations, the modeling of dynamics can bridge this gap. Incorporating spatio-temporal heterogeneity also advances the main goal, since it can extend the parameter space and allow more flexibility. Despite these advances, two limitations persist: 1) the modeling of dynamics is often limited to the dynamics of spatial topology (e.g., adjacency matrix changes), which, however, can be extended to a broader scope; 2) the modeling of heterogeneity is often separated for spatial and temporal dimensions, but this gap can also be bridged by the modeling of dynamics. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for traffic prediction, called Meta Dynamic Graph (MetaDG). MetaDG leverages dynamic graph structures of node representations to explicitly model spatio-temporal dynamics. This generates both dynamic adjacency matrices and meta-parameters, extending dynamic modeling beyond topology while unifying the capture of spatio-temporal heterogeneity into a single dimension. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of MetaDG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Recent advances in data availability and computational power enable new forms of model-driven, simulation-based decision support for transportation policy design. This paper proposes a novel simulation paradigm for the ex-ante evaluation of both direct impacts (e.g., traffic conditions, modal shift, emissions) and indirect impacts spanning transportation-related effects and economic accessibility. The approach integrates a multi-layer urban mobility model combining a physical layer of mobility flows and emissions with a social layer capturing behavioral responses and adaptation to policy changes. Real-world data are used to instantiate the current as-is scenario, while policy alternatives and behavioral assumptions are encoded as model parameters to generate multiple what-if scenarios. The framework supports systematic comparison across scenarios by analyzing variations in simulated outcomes induced by policy interventions. The proposed approach is illustrated through a case study that aims to assess the impacts of the introduction of broad urban traffic restriction schemes. Results demonstrate the framework's ability to explore alternative regulatory designs and user responses, supporting informed and anticipatory evaluation of urban traffic policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bias in the Shadows: Explore Shortcuts in Encrypted Network Traffic Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10180v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained models operating directly on raw bytes have achieved promising performance in encrypted network traffic classification (NTC), but often suffer from shortcut learning-relying on spurious correlations that fail to generalize to real-world data. Existing solutions heavily rely on model-specific interpretation techniques, which lack adaptability and generality across different model architectures and deployment scenarios. In this paper, we propose BiasSeeker, the first semi-automated framework that is both model-agnostic and data-driven for detecting dataset-specific shortcut features in encrypted traffic. By performing statistical correlation analysis directly on raw binary traffic, BiasSeeker identifies spurious or environment-entangled features that may compromise generalization, independent of any classifier. To address the diverse nature of shortcut features, we introduce a systematic categorization and apply category-specific validation strategies that reduce bias while preserving meaningful information. We evaluate BiasSeeker on 19 public datasets across three NTC tasks. By emphasizing context-aware feature selection and dataset-specific diagnosis, BiasSeeker offers a novel perspective for understanding and addressing shortcut learning in encrypted network traffic classification, raising awareness that feature selection should be an intentional and scenario-sensitive step prior to model training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lens: A Knowledge-Guided Foundation Model for Network Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03646v5)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network traffic refers to the amount of data being sent and received over the Internet or any system that connects computers. Analyzing network traffic is vital for security and management, yet remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of plain-text packet headers and encrypted payloads. To capture the latent semantics of traffic, recent studies have adopted Transformer-based pretraining techniques to learn network representations from massive traffic data. However, these methods pre-train on data-driven tasks but overlook network knowledge, such as masking partial digits of the indivisible network port numbers for prediction, thereby limiting semantic understanding. In addition, they struggle to extend classification to new classes during fine-tuning due to the distribution shift. Motivated by these limitations, we propose \Lens, a unified knowledge-guided foundation model for both network traffic classification and generation. In pretraining, we propose a Knowledge-Guided Mask Span Prediction method with textual context for learning knowledge-enriched representations. For extending to new classes in finetuning, we reframe the traffic classification as a closed-ended generation task and introduce context-aware finetuning to adapt to the distribution shift. Evaluation results across various benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed Lens~achieves superior performance on both classification and generation tasks. For traffic classification, Lens~outperforms competitive baselines substantially on 8 out of 12 tasks with an average accuracy of \textbf{96.33\%} and extends to novel classes with significantly better performance. For traffic generation, Lens~generates better high-fidelity network traffic for network simulation, gaining up to \textbf{30.46\%} and \textbf{33.3\%} better accuracy and F1 in fuzzing tests. We will open-source the code upon publication.</p></details> |  |

Operating within the emerging UAS Traffic Management (UTM) framework, these lightweight and highly networked platforms depend on secure communication, navigation, and surveillance (CNS) subsystems that are vulnerable to spoofing, jamming, hijacking, and data manipulation. While prior reviews of UAS security addressed these challenges at a conceptual level, a detailed, system-oriented analysis for resource-constrained sUAS remains lacking. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of cyber-security vulnerabilities and defenses tailored to the sUAS and UTM ecosystem. We organize existing research across the full cyber-physical stack, encompassing CNS, data links, sensing and perception, UTM cloud access, and software integrity layers, and classify attack vectors according to their technical targets and operational impacts. Correspondingly, we review defense mechanisms ranging from classical encryption and authentication to adaptive intrusion detection, lightweight cryptography, and secure firmware management. By mapping threats to mitigation strategies and evaluating their scalability and practical effectiveness, this work establishes a unified taxonomy and identifies open challenges for achieving safe, secure, and scalable sUAS operations within future UTM environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

This paper puts forward a single-agent reinforcement learning (RL)-based regional traffic signal control (TSC) model. Different from multi - agent systems, this model can coordinate traffic signals across a large area, with the goals of alleviating regional traffic congestion and minimizing the total travel time. The TSC environment is precisely defined through specific state space, action space, and reward functions. The state space consists of the current congestion state, which is represented by the queue lengths of each link, and the current signal phase scheme of intersections. The action space is designed to select an intersection first and then adjust its phase split. Two reward functions are meticulously crafted. One focuses on alleviating congestion and the other aims to minimize the total travel time while considering the congestion level. The experiments are carried out with the SUMO traffic simulation software. The performance of the TSC model is evaluated by comparing it with a base case where no signal-timing adjustments are made. The results show that the model can effectively control congestion. For example, the queuing length is significantly reduced in the scenarios tested. Moreover, when the reward is set to both alleviate congestion and minimize the total travel time, the average travel time is remarkably decreased, which indicates that the model can effectively improve traffic conditions. This research provides a new approach for large-scale regional traffic signal control and offers valuable insights for future urban traffic management.</p></details> | <details><summary>A cri...</summary><p>A critical error in the methodology.

| **[Robust Single-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Regional Traffic Signal Control Under Demand Fluctuations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00549v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic congestion, primarily driven by intersection queuing, significantly impacts urban living standards, safety, environmental quality, and economic efficiency. While Traffic Signal Control (TSC) systems hold potential for congestion mitigation, traditional optimization models often fail to capture real-world traffic complexity and dynamics. This study introduces a novel single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework for regional adaptive TSC, circumventing the coordination complexities inherent in multi-agent systems through a centralized decision-making paradigm. The model employs an adjacency matrix to unify the encoding of road network topology, real-time queue states derived from probe vehicle data, and current signal timing parameters. Leveraging the efficient learning capabilities of the DreamerV3 world model, the agent learns control policies where actions sequentially select intersections and adjust their signal phase splits to regulate traffic inflow/outflow, analogous to a feedback control system. Reward design prioritizes queue dissipation, directly linking congestion metrics (queue length) to control actions. Simulation experiments conducted in SUMO demonstrate the model's effectiveness: under inference scenarios with multi-level (10%, 20%, 30%) Origin-Destination (OD) demand fluctuations, the framework exhibits robust anti-fluctuation capability and significantly reduces queue lengths. This work establishes a new paradigm for intelligent traffic control compatible with probe vehicle technology. Future research will focus on enhancing practical applicability by incorporating stochastic OD demand fluctuations during training and exploring regional optimization mechanisms for contingency events.</p></details> | <details><summary>A cri...</summary><p>A critical error in the methodology.

| **[Single-agent Reinforcement Learning Model for Regional Adaptive Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00551v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several studies have employed reinforcement learning (RL) to address the challenges of regional adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) and achieved promising results. In this field, existing research predominantly adopts multi-agent frameworks. However, the adoption of multi-agent frameworks presents challenges for scalability. Instead, the Traffic signal control (TSC) problem necessitates a single-agent framework. TSC inherently relies on centralized management by a single control center, which can monitor traffic conditions across all roads in the study area and coordinate the control of all intersections. This work proposes a single-agent RL-based regional ATSC model compatible with probe vehicle technology. Key components of the RL design include state, action, and reward function definitions. To facilitate learning and manage congestion, both state and reward functions are defined based on queue length, with action designed to regulate queue dynamics. The queue length definition used in this study differs slightly from conventional definitions but is closely correlated with congestion states. More importantly, it allows for reliable estimation using link travel time data from probe vehicles. With probe vehicle data already covering most urban roads, this feature enhances the proposed method's potential for widespread deployment. The method was comprehensively evaluated using the SUMO simulation platform. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively mitigates large-scale regional congestion levels via coordinated multi-intersection control.</p></details> | <details><summary>A cri...</summary><p>A critical error in the methodology.

| **[Studying the Role of Synthetic Data for Machine Learning-based Wireless Networks Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07646v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic data generation is an appealing tool for augmenting and enriching datasets, playing a crucial role in advancing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Not only does synthetic data help build robust AI/ML datasets cost-effectively, but it also offers privacy-friendly solutions and bypasses the complexities of storing large data volumes. This paper proposes a novel method to generate synthetic data, based on first-order auto-regressive noise statistics, for large-scale Wi-Fi deployments. The approach operates with minimal real data requirements while producing statistically rich traffic patterns that effectively mimic real Access Point (AP) behavior. Experimental results show that ML models trained on synthetic data achieve Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values within 10 to 15 of those obtained using real data when trained on the same APs, while requiring significantly less training data. Moreover, when generalization is required, synthetic-data-trained models improve prediction accuracy by up to 50 percent compared to real-data-trained baselines, thanks to the enhanced variability and diversity of the generated traces. Overall, the proposed method bridges the gap between synthetic data generation and practical Wi-Fi traffic forecasting, providing a scalable, efficient, and real-time solution for modern wireless networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sensor Placement for Urban Traffic Interpolation: A Data-Driven Evaluation to Inform Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10747v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data on citywide street-segment traffic volumes are essential for urban planning and sustainable mobility management. Yet such data are available only for a limited subset of streets due to the high costs of sensor deployment and maintenance. Traffic volumes on the remaining network are therefore interpolated based on existing sensor measurements. However, current sensor locations are often determined by administrative priorities rather than by data-driven optimization, leading to biased coverage and reduced estimation performance. This study provides a large-scale, real-world benchmarking of easily implementable, data-driven strategies for optimizing the placement of permanent and temporary traffic sensors, using segment-level data from Berlin (Strava bicycle counts) and Manhattan (taxi counts). It compares spatial placement strategies based on network centrality, spatial coverage, feature coverage, and active learning. In addition, the study examines temporal deployment schemes for temporary sensors. The findings highlight that spatial placement strategies that emphasize even spatial coverage and employ active learning achieve the lowest prediction errors. With only 10 sensors, they reduce the mean absolute error by over 60% in Berlin and 70% in Manhattan compared to alternatives. Temporal deployment choices further improve performance: distributing measurements evenly across weekdays reduces error by an additional 7% in Berlin and 21% in Manhattan. Together, these spatial and temporal principles allow temporary deployments to closely approximate the performance of optimally placed permanent deployments. From a policy perspective, the results indicate that cities can substantially improve data usefulness by adopting data-driven sensor placement strategies, while retaining flexibility in choosing between temporary and permanent deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[qAttCNN - Self Attention Mechanism for Video QoE Prediction in Encrypted Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06862v1)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of multimedia consumption, driven by major advances in mobile devices since the mid-2000s, has led to widespread use of video conferencing applications (VCAs) such as Zoom and Google Meet, as well as instant messaging applications (IMAs) like WhatsApp and Telegram, which increasingly support video conferencing as a core feature. Many of these systems rely on the Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) protocol, enabling direct peer-to-peer media streaming without requiring a third-party server to relay data, reducing the latency and facilitating a real-time communication. Despite WebRTC's potential, adverse network conditions can degrade streaming quality and consequently reduce users' Quality of Experience (QoE). Maintaining high QoE therefore requires continuous monitoring and timely intervention when QoE begins to deteriorate. While content providers can often estimate QoE by directly comparing transmitted and received media, this task is significantly more challenging for internet service providers (ISPs). End-to-end encryption, commonly used by modern VCAs and IMAs, prevent ISPs from accessing the original media stream, leaving only Quality of Service (QoS) and routing information available. To address this limitation, we propose the QoE Attention Convolutional Neural Network (qAttCNN), a model that leverages packet size parameter of the traffic to infer two no-reference QoE metrics viz. BRISQUE and frames per second (FPS). We evaluate qAttCNN on a custom dataset collected from WhatsApp video calls and compare it against existing QoE models. Using mean absolute error percentage (MAEP), our approach achieves 2.14% error for BRISQUE and 7.39% for FPS prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synecdoche: Efficient and Accurate In-Network Traffic Classification via Direct Packet Sequential Pattern Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21116v2)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic classification on programmable data plane holds great promise for line-rate processing, with methods evolving from per-packet to flow-level analysis for higher accuracy. However, a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency persists. Statistical feature-based methods align with hardware constraints but often exhibit limited accuracy, while online deep learning methods using packet sequential features achieve superior accuracy but require substantial computational resources. This paper presents Synecdoche, the first traffic classification framework that successfully deploys packet sequential features on a programmable data plane via pattern matching, achieving both high accuracy and efficiency. Our key insight is that discriminative information concentrates in short sub-sequences--termed Key Segments--that serve as compact traffic features for efficient data plane matching. Synecdoche employs an "offline discovery, online matching" paradigm: deep learning models automatically discover Key Segment patterns offline, which are then compiled into optimized table entries for direct data plane matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate Synecdoche's superior accuracy, improving F1-scores by up to 26.4% against statistical methods and 18.3% against online deep learning methods, while reducing latency by 13.0% and achieving 79.2% reduction in SRAM usage. The source code of Synecdoche is publicly available to facilitate reproducibility and further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE INFOCOM 2026</p></details> |
| **[Reinforcement Learning-Guided Dynamic Multi-Graph Fusion for Evacuation Traffic Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06664v1)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time traffic prediction is critical for managing transportation systems during hurricane evacuations. Although data-driven graph-learning models have demonstrated strong capabilities in capturing the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of evacuation traffic at a network level, they mostly consider a single dimension (e.g., travel-time or distance) to construct the underlying graph. Furthermore, these models often lack interpretability, offering little insight into which input variables contribute most to their predictive performance. To overcome these limitations, we develop a novel Reinforcement Learning-guided Dynamic Multi-Graph Fusion (RL-DMF) framework for evacuation traffic prediction. We construct multiple dynamic graphs at each time step to represent heterogeneous spatiotemporal relationships between traffic detectors. A dynamic multi-graph fusion (DMF) module is employed to adaptively learn and combine information from these graphs. To enhance model interpretability, we introduce RL-based intelligent feature selection and ranking (RL-IFSR) method that learns to mask irrelevant features during model training. The model is evaluated using a real-world dataset of 12 hurricanes affecting Florida from 2016 to 2024. For an unseen hurricane (Milton, 2024), the model achieves a 95% accuracy (RMSE = 293.9) for predicting the next 1-hour traffic flow. Moreover, the model can forecast traffic flow for up to next 6 hours with 90% accuracy (RMSE = 426.4). The RL-DMF framework outperforms several state-of-the-art traffic prediction models. Furthermore, ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of dynamic multi-graph fusion and RL-IFSR approaches for improving model performance. This research provides a generalized and interpretable model for real-time evacuation traffic forecasting, with significant implications for evacuation traffic management.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we offer a complementary perspective by examining outbound traffic, and argue that a narrow subset -- what we term erroneous outbound traffic -- is a lighter and revealing yet overlooked data source for identifying a broad range of security threats and network problems. This traffic consists of packets sent by internal hosts that either receive no response, trigger ICMP errors, or are ICMP error messages themselves generated in response to unsolicited requests. To demonstrate its potential, we collect and analyse erroneous traffic from a large network, uncovering a variety of previously unnoticed issues, including misconfigurations, obsolete deployments and compromised hosts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at ACM IMC 2025 Student Workshop</p></details> |

However, human drivers exhibit bounded rationality, making approximately optimal decisions under cognitive and perceptual constraints. We propose EvoQRE, a principled framework for modeling safety-critical traffic interactions as general-sum Markov games solved via Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE) and evolutionary game dynamics. EvoQRE integrates a pre-trained generative world model with entropy-regularized replicator dynamics, capturing stochastic human behavior while maintaining equilibrium structure. We provide rigorous theoretical results, proving that the proposed dynamics converge to Logit-QRE under a two-timescale stochastic approximation with an explicit convergence rate of O(log k / k^{1/3}) under weak monotonicity assumptions. We further extend QRE to continuous action spaces using mixture-based and energy-based policy representations. Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset and nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that EvoQRE achieves state-of-the-art realism, improved safety metrics, and controllable generation of diverse safety-critical scenarios through interpretable rationality parameters.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

These often rely on heterogeneous sensing infrastructures and distinct routing algorithms, which can yield misaligned perceptions of the traffic environment and route preferences. While such technologies accelerate the transition toward increasingly intelligent transportation networks, their current deployment fails to avoid challenges associated with selfish routing behavior, in which drivers or automated agents prioritize individually optimal routes instead of network-wide congestion mitigation. Existing traffic flow management strategies can address leader-follower dynamics in traffic routing problems but are not designed to account for vehicles capable of dynamically switching between multiple operational modes. This paper models the interaction between a vehicle control arbitration system and a multi-modal vehicle as a repeated single-leader, multiple follower Stackelberg game with asymmetric information. To address the intractability of computing an exact solution in this setting, we propose a Trust-Aware Control Trading Strategy (TACTS) utilizing a regret matching-based algorithm to adaptively update the arbitration system's mixed strategy over sequential, dynamic routing decisions. Theoretical results provide bounds on the realized total network travel time under TACTS algorithm relative to the system-optimal total network travel time. Experimental results of simulations between the system and a vehicle in several real-world traffic networks under various different congestion levels demonstrate that TACTS consistently reduces network-wide congestion and generally outperforms alternative routing and control-allocation strategies, particularly under high congestion and heavy induced vehicle flows.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures; This is a working draft and can potentially have errors.

However, they remain difficult to obtain due to privacy constraints, data sensitivity, and the cost of building controlled collection environments such as testbeds and cyber ranges. This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can operate as controlled knowledge-to-data engines for generating structured synthetic network traffic datasets suitable for IDS research. We propose a methodology that combines protocol documentation, attack semantics, and explicit statistical rules to condition LLMs without fine-tuning or access to raw samples. Using the AWID3 IEEE~802.11 benchmark as a demanding case study, we generate labeled datasets with four state-of-the-art LLMs and assess fidelity through a multi-level validation framework including global similarity metrics, per-feature distribution testing, structural comparison, and cross-domain classification. Results show that, under explicit constraints, LLM-generated datasets can closely approximate the statistical and structural characteristics of real network traffic, enabling gradient-boosting classifiers to achieve F1-scores up to 0.956 when evaluated on real samples. Overall, the findings suggest that constrained LLM-driven generation can facilitate on-demand IDS experimentation, providing a testbed-free, privacy-preserving alternative that overcomes the traditional bottlenecks of physical traffic collection and manual labeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Feedback Diffusion Guidance for Controlled Traffic Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04572v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imputing missing values in spatial-temporal traffic data is essential for intelligent transportation systems. Among advanced imputation methods, score-based diffusion models have demonstrated competitive performance. These models generate data by reversing a noising process, using observed values as conditional guidance. However, existing diffusion models typically apply a uniform guidance scale across both spatial and temporal dimensions, which is inadequate for nodes with high missing data rates. Sparse observations provide insufficient conditional guidance, causing the generative process to drift toward the learned prior distribution rather than closely following the conditional observations, resulting in suboptimal imputation performance. To address this, we propose FENCE, a spatial-temporal feedback diffusion guidance method designed to adaptively control guidance scales during imputation. First, FENCE introduces a dynamic feedback mechanism that adjusts the guidance scale based on the posterior likelihood approximations. The guidance scale is increased when generated values diverge from observations and reduced when alignment improves, preventing overcorrection. Second, because alignment to observations varies across nodes and denoising steps, a global guidance scale for all nodes is suboptimal. FENCE computes guidance scales at the cluster level by grouping nodes based on their attention scores, leveraging spatial-temporal correlations to provide more accurate guidance. Experimental results on real-world traffic datasets show that FENCE significantly enhances imputation accuracy.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a novel Graph Enhanced Spatio-temporal Hierarchical Inference Network (GEnSHIN) to handle the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic flow prediction. The model integrates three innovative designs: 1) An attention-enhanced Graph Convolutional Recurrent Unit (GCRU), which strengthens the modeling capability for long-term temporal dependencies by introducing Transformer modules; 2) An asymmetric dual-embedding graph generation mechanism, which leverages the real road network and data-driven latent asymmetric topology to generate graph structures that better fit the characteristics of actual traffic flow; 3) A dynamic memory bank module, which utilizes learnable traffic pattern prototypes to provide personalized traffic pattern representations for each sensor node, and introduces a lightweight graph updater during the decoding phase to adapt to dynamic changes in road network states. Extensive experiments on the public dataset METR-LA show that GEnSHIN achieves or surpasses the performance of comparative models across multiple metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Notably, the model demonstrates excellent prediction stability during peak morning and evening traffic hours. Ablation experiments further validate the effectiveness of each core module and its contribution to the final performance.</p></details> |  |

With the aim of overcoming such limitations, network operators are foreseeing Digital Twins (DTs) as key enablers, which are designed as dynamic and virtual replicas of network infrastructure, allowing operators to model, analyze, and optimize various operations without any risk of affecting the live network. However, for Digital Twin Networks (DTNs) to meet the challenges faced by operators especially in line with resource management, a driving engine is needed. In this paper, an AI (Artificial Intelligence)-driven approach is presented by integrating a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network into the DT framework, aimed at forecasting network traffic patterns and proactively managing resource allocation. Through analytical experiments, the AI-Enabled DT framework demonstrates superior performance benchmarked against baseline methods. Our study concludes that embedding AI capabilities within DTs paves the way for fully autonomous, adaptive, and high-performance network management in future mobile networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM) 2025</p></details> |

| **[Online Action-Stacking Improves Reinforcement Learning Performance for Air Traffic Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04287v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce online action-stacking, an inference-time wrapper for reinforcement learning policies that produces realistic air traffic control commands while allowing training on a much smaller discrete action space. Policies are trained with simple incremental heading or level adjustments, together with an action-damping penalty that reduces instruction frequency and leads agents to issue commands in short bursts. At inference, online action-stacking compiles these bursts of primitive actions into domain-appropriate compound clearances. Using Proximal Policy Optimisation and the BluebirdDT digital twin platform, we train agents to navigate aircraft along lateral routes, manage climb and descent to target flight levels, and perform two-aircraft collision avoidance under a minimum separation constraint. In our lateral navigation experiments, action stacking greatly reduces the number of issued instructions relative to a damped baseline and achieves comparable performance to a policy trained with a 37-dimensional action space, despite operating with only five actions. These results indicate that online action-stacking helps bridge a key gap between standard reinforcement learning formulations and operational ATC requirements, and provides a simple mechanism for scaling to more complex control scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Future Capabilities Agent for Tactical Air Traffic Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04285v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Escalating air traffic demand is driving the adoption of automation to support air traffic controllers, but existing approaches face a trade-off between safety assurance and interpretability. Optimisation-based methods such as reinforcement learning offer strong performance but are difficult to verify and explain, while rules-based systems are transparent yet rarely check safety under uncertainty. This paper outlines Agent Mallard, a forward-planning, rules-based agent for tactical control in systemised airspace that embeds a stochastic digital twin directly into its conflict-resolution loop. Mallard operates on predefined GPS-guided routes, reducing continuous 4D vectoring to discrete choices over lanes and levels, and constructs hierarchical plans from an expert-informed library of deconfliction strategies. A depth-limited backtracking search uses causal attribution, topological plan splicing, and monotonic axis constraints to seek a complete safe plan for all aircraft, validating each candidate manoeuvre against uncertain execution scenarios (e.g., wind variation, pilot response, communication loss) before commitment. Preliminary walkthroughs with UK controllers and initial tests in the BluebirdDT airspace digital twin indicate that Mallard's behaviour aligns with expert reasoning and resolves conflicts in simplified scenarios. The architecture is intended to combine model-based safety assessment, interpretable decision logic, and tractable computational performance in future structured en-route environments.</p></details> |  |

| **[Detection and Prevention of Process Disruption Attacks in the Electrical Power Systems using MMS Traffic: An EPIC Case](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03690v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart grids are increasingly exposed to sophisticated cyber threats due to their reliance on interconnected communication networks, as demonstrated by real world incidents such as the cyberattacks on the Ukrainian power grid. In IEC61850 based smart substations, the Manufacturing Message Specification protocol operates over TCP to facilitate communication between SCADA systems and field devices such as Intelligent Electronic Devices and Programmable Logic Controllers. Although MMS enables efficient monitoring and control, it can be exploited by adversaries to generate legitimate looking packets for reconnaissance, unauthorized state reading, and malicious command injection, thereby disrupting grid operations. In this work, we propose a fully automated attack detection and prevention framework for IEC61850 compliant smart substations to counter remote cyberattacks that manipulate process states through compromised PLCs and IEDs. A detailed analysis of the MMS protocol is presented, and critical MMS field value pairs are extracted during both normal SCADA operation and active attack conditions. The proposed framework is validated using seven datasets comprising benign operational scenarios and multiple attack instances, including IEC61850Bean based attacks and script driven attacks leveraging the libiec61850 library. Our approach accurately identifies attack signature carrying MMS packets that attempt to disrupt circuit breaker status, specifically targeting the smart home zone IED and PLC of the EPIC testbed. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in precisely detecting malicious MMS traffic and enhancing the cyber resilience of IEC61850 based smart grid environments.</p></details> |  |

The Digital Twin is intended to support the development and rigorous human-in-the-loop evaluation of AI agents for Air Traffic Control (ATC), providing a virtual representation of real-world airspace that enables safe exploration of higher levels of ATC automation. This paper makes three significant contributions: firstly, we demonstrate how historical and live operational data may be combined with a probabilistic, physics-informed machine learning model of aircraft performance to reproduce real-world traffic scenarios, while accurately reflecting the level of uncertainty inherent in ATC. Secondly, we develop a structured assurance case, following the Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance framework, to provide quantitative evidence for the Digital Twin's accuracy and fidelity. This is crucial to building trust in this novel technology within this safety-critical domain. Thirdly, we describe how the Digital Twin forms a unified environment for agent testing and evaluation. This includes fast-time execution (up to x200 real-time), a standardised Python-based ``gym'' interface that supports a range of AI agent designs, and a suite of quantitative metrics for assessing performance. Crucially, the framework facilitates competency-based assessment of AI agents by qualified Air Traffic Control Officers through a Human Machine Interface. We also outline further applications and future extensions of the Digital Twin architecture.</p></details> |  |

A Systematic Evaluation of Advanced Deep Forecasting Models Accuracy and Efficiency for Network Traffic Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02694v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network traffic prediction is essential for automating modern network management. It is a difficult time series forecasting (TSF) problem that has been addressed by Deep Learning (DL) models due to their ability to capture complex patterns. Advances in forecasting, from sophisticated transformer architectures to simple linear models, have improved performance across diverse prediction tasks. However, given the variability of network traffic across network environments and traffic series timescales, it is essential to identify effective deployment choices and modeling directions for network traffic prediction. This study systematically identify and evaluates twelve advanced TSF models -- including transformer-based and traditional DL approaches, each with unique advantages for network traffic prediction -- against three statistical baselines on four real traffic datasets, across multiple time scales and horizons, assessing performance, robustness to anomalies, data gaps, external factors, data efficiency, and resource efficiency in terms of time, memory, and energy. Results highlight performance regimes, efficiency thresholds, and promising architectures that balance accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating robustness to traffic challenges and suggesting new directions beyond traditional RNNs.</p></details> | 19 pages, 13 figures |

We investigate oblivious load-balancing schemes for a $N\times N$ torus network under sparse traffic where there are at most $k$ active source-destination pairs. We are motivated by the problem of load-balancing in large-scale LEO satellite networks, which can be modelled as a torus, where the traffic is known to be sparse and localized to certain hotspot areas. We formulate the problem as a linear program and show that no oblivious routing scheme can achieve a worst-case load lower than approximately $\frac{\sqrt{2k}}{4}$ when $1<k \leq N^2/2$ and $\frac{N}{4}$ when $N^2/2\leq k\leq N^2$. Moreover, we demonstrate that the celebrated Valiant Load Balancing scheme is suboptimal under sparse traffic and construct an optimal oblivious load-balancing scheme that achieves the lower bound. Further, we discover a $\sqrt{2}$ multiplicative gap between the worst-case load of a non-oblivious routing and the worst-case load of any oblivious routing. The results can also be extended to general $N\times M$ tori with unequal link capacities along the vertical and horizontal directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear in IEEE INFOCOM 2026</p></details> |

It is essential to have tools that help analyze large volumes of stored traffic data and make effective interventions. To address this need, we present ``BigSUMO", an end-to-end, scalable, open-source framework for analytics, interruption detection, and parallel traffic simulation. Our system ingests high-resolution loop detector and signal state data, along with sparse probe trajectory data. It first performs descriptive analytics and detects potential interruptions. It then uses the SUMO microsimulator for prescriptive analytics, testing hundreds of what-if scenarios to optimize traffic performance. The modular design allows integration of different algorithms for data processing and outlier detection. Built using open-source software and libraries, the pipeline is cost-effective, scalable, and easy to deploy. We hope BigSUMO will be a valuable aid in developing smart city mobility solutions.</p></details> | 6 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Nonlinear Oscillatory Response of Automated Vehicle Car-following: Theoretical Analysis with Traffic State and Control Input Limits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24029v3)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a framework grounded in the theory of describing function (DF) and incremental-input DF to theoretically analyze the nonlinear oscillatory response of automated vehicles (AVs) car-following (CF) amidst traffic oscillations, considering the limits of traffic state and control input. While prevailing approaches largely ignore these limits (i.e., saturation of acceleration/deceleration and speed) and focus on linear string stability analysis, this framework establishes a basis for theoretically analyzing the frequency response of AV systems with nonlinearities imposed by these limits. To this end, trajectories of CF pairs are decomposed into nominal and oscillatory trajectories, subsequently, the controlled AV system is repositioned within the oscillatory trajectory coordinates. Built on this base, DFs are employed to approximate the frequency responses of nonlinear saturation components by using their first harmonic output, thereby capturing the associated amplification ratio and phase shift. Considering the closed-loop nature of AV control systems, where system states and control input mutually influence each other, amplification ratios and phase shifts are balanced within the loop to ensure consistency. This balancing process may render multiple solutions, hence the incremental-input DF is further applied to identify the reasonable ones. The proposed method is validated by estimations from Simulink, and further comparisons with prevailing methods are conducted. Results confirm the alignment of our framework with Simulink results and exhibit its superior accuracy in analysis compared to the prevailing methods. Furthermore, the framework proves valuable in string stability analysis, especially when conventional linear methods offer misleading insights.</p></details> |  |

Traditional data augmentation methods struggle to preserve the complex temporal and statistical characteristics of real network traffic. To address these issues, this work explores the use of Generative AI (GAI) models to synthesize realistic and diverse encrypted traffic traces. We evaluate three approaches: Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), and SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), each integrated with a preprocessing pipeline that includes feature selection and class balancing. The UNSW NB-15 dataset is used as the primary benchmark, focusing on Tor traffic as anomalies. We analyze statistical similarity between real and synthetic data, and assess classifier performance using metrics such as Accuracy, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. Results show that VAE-generated data provides the best balance between privacy and performance, while GANs offer higher fidelity but risk overfitting. SMOTE, though simple, enhances recall but may lack diversity. The findings demonstrate that GAI methods can significantly improve encrypted traffic detection when trained with privacy-preserving synthetic data.</p></details> | <details><summary>The e...</summary><p>The entire code is available at https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ubglT_7WsiKfzEQ547Kjej3r9xD-4lkT#scrollTo=2-v2GLgWjt1L</p></details> |
| **[Traffic-Aware Optimal Taxi Placement Using Graph Neural Network-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00607v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of smart city transportation, efficient matching of taxi supply with passenger demand requires real-time integration of urban traffic network data and mobility patterns. Conventional taxi hotspot prediction models often rely solely on historical demand, overlooking dynamic influences such as traffic congestion, road incidents, and public events. This paper presents a traffic-aware, graph-based reinforcement learning (RL) framework for optimal taxi placement in metropolitan environments. The urban road network is modeled as a graph where intersections represent nodes, road segments serve as edges, and node attributes capture historical demand, event proximity, and real-time congestion scores obtained from live traffic APIs. Graph Neural Network (GNN) embeddings are employed to encode spatial-temporal dependencies within the traffic network, which are then used by a Q-learning agent to recommend optimal taxi hotspots. The reward mechanism jointly optimizes passenger waiting time, driver travel distance, and congestion avoidance. Experiments on a simulated Delhi taxi dataset, generated using real geospatial boundaries and historic ride-hailing request patterns, demonstrate that the proposed model reduced passenger waiting time by about 56% and reduced travel distance by 38% compared to baseline stochastic selection. The proposed approach is adaptable to multi-modal transport systems and can be integrated into smart city platforms for real-time urban mobility optimization.</p></details> |  |

This work bridges the gap between advanced representation learning and practical network protection by introducing Traffic-MoE, a sparse foundation model optimized for high-efficiency real-time inference. By dynamically routing traffic tokens to a small subset of specialized experts, Traffic-MoE effectively decouples model capacity from computational overhead. Extensive evaluations across three security-oriented tasks demonstrate that Traffic-MoE achieves up to a 12.38% improvement in detection performance compared to leading dense competitors. Crucially, it delivers a 91.62% increase in throughput, reduces inference latency by 47.81%, and cuts peak GPU memory consumption by 38.72%. Beyond efficiency, Traffic-MoE exhibits superior robustness against adversarial traffic shaping and maintains high detection efficacy in few-shot scenarios, establishing a new paradigm for scalable and resilient network traffic analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intelligent Traffic Surveillance for Real-Time Vehicle Detection, License Plate Recognition, and Speed Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00344v1)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speeding is a major contributor to road fatalities, particularly in developing countries such as Uganda, where road safety infrastructure is limited. This study proposes a real-time intelligent traffic surveillance system tailored to such regions, using computer vision techniques to address vehicle detection, license plate recognition, and speed estimation. The study collected a rich dataset using a speed gun, a Canon Camera, and a mobile phone to train the models. License plate detection using YOLOv8 achieved a mean average precision (mAP) of 97.9%. For character recognition of the detected license plate, the CNN model got a character error rate (CER) of 3.85%, while the transformer model significantly reduced the CER to 1.79%. Speed estimation used source and target regions of interest, yielding a good performance of 10 km/h margin of error. Additionally, a database was established to correlate user information with vehicle detection data, enabling automated ticket issuance via SMS via Africa's Talking API. This system addresses critical traffic management needs in resource-constrained environments and shows potential to reduce road accidents through automated traffic enforcement in developing countries where such interventions are urgently needed.</p></details> |  |

Using a dataset of 500,000 U.S. traffic accidents spanning 2016-2023, we trained an XGBoost classifier optimized through randomized search cross-validation and adjusted for class imbalance via class weighting. The final model achieves an overall accuracy of 78%, with strong performance on the majority class (Severity 2), attaining 87% precision and recall. Feature importance analysis reveals that time of day, geographic location, and weather-related variables, including visibility, temperature, and wind speed, rank among the strongest predictors of accident severity. However, contrary to initial hypotheses, precipitation and visibility demonstrate limited predictive power, potentially reflecting behavioral adaptation by drivers under overtly hazardous conditions. The dataset's predominance of mid-level severity accidents constrains the model's capacity to learn meaningful patterns for extreme cases, highlighting the need for alternative sampling strategies, enhanced feature engineering, and integration of external datasets. These findings contribute to evidence-based traffic management and suggest future directions for severity prediction research.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures, 0 tables.

However, due to significant privacy concerns surrounding traffic data, most existing methods rely on local training, resulting in data silos and limited knowledge sharing. Federated Learning (FL) offers an efficient solution through privacy-preserving collaborative training; however, standard FL struggles with the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) problem among clients. This challenge has led to the emergence of Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) as a promising paradigm. Nevertheless, current PFL frameworks require further adaptation for traffic prediction tasks, such as specialized graph feature engineering, data processing, and network architecture design. A notable limitation of many prior studies is their reliance on hyper-parameter optimization across datasets-information that is often unavailable in real-world scenarios-thus impeding practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose AutoFed, a novel PFL framework for traffic prediction that eliminates the need for manual hyper-parameter tuning. Inspired by prompt learning, AutoFed introduces a federated representor that employs a client-aligned adapter to distill local data into a compact, globally shared prompt matrix. This prompt then conditions a personalized predictor, allowing each client to benefit from cross-client knowledge while maintaining local specificity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that AutoFed consistently achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios.

The data consist of information on millions of traffic stops across close to 100 different cities and highway patrols. Using a variety of metrics, we identify that the data is not missing completely at random. Furthermore, we develop ways of quantifying and visualizing missingness trends for different variables across the datasets. We follow up by performing a sensitivity analysis to extend work done on the outcome test as well as to extend work done on sharp bounds on the average treatment effect. We demonstrate that bias calculations can fundamentally shift depending on the assumptions made about the observations for which the race variable has not been recorded. We suggest ways that our missingness sensitivity analysis can be extended to myriad different contexts.</p></details> |  |

Accurate forecasting relies on continuous observations collected by traffic sensors. However, due to high deployment and maintenance costs, not all regions are equipped with such sensors. This paper aims to forecast for regions without traffic sensors, where the lack of historical traffic observations challenges the generalisability of existing models. We propose a model named GenCast, the core idea of which is to exploit external knowledge to compensate for the missing observations and to enhance generalisation. We integrate physics-informed neural networks into GenCast, enabling physical principles to regularise the learning process. We introduce an external signal learning module to explore correlations between traffic states and external signals such as weather conditions, further improving model generalisability. Additionally, we design a spatial grouping module to filter localised features that hinder model generalisability. Extensive experiments show that GenCast consistently reduces forecasting errors on multiple real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Stringent safety requirements make high fidelity one of the key metrics for simulation platforms. Despite advancements in simulation platforms for low-altitude UAVs, there is still a shortage of platforms that feature rich traffic scenarios, high-precision UAV and scenario simulators, and comprehensive testing capabilities for low-altitude traffic. Therefore, this paper introduces an integrated high-fidelity simulation platform for low-altitude UAV traffic. This platform simulates all components of the UAV traffic network, including the control system, the traffic management system, the UAV system, the communication network , the anomaly and fault modules, etc. Furthermore, it integrates RflySim/AirSim and Unreal Engine 5 to develop full-state models of UAVs and 3D maps that model the real world using the oblique photogrammetry technique. Additionally, the platform offers a wide range of interfaces, and all models and scenarios can be customized with a high degree of flexibility. The platform's source code has been released, making it easier to conduct research related to low-altitude traffic.</p></details> |  |

Although advanced Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) and pre-trained models have achieved significant progress in traffic prediction, two key challenges remain: (i) limited contextual capacity when modeling complex spatio-temporal dependencies, and (ii) low predictability at fine-grained spatio-temporal points due to heterogeneous patterns. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we propose RAST, a universal framework that integrates retrieval-augmented mechanisms with spatio-temporal modeling to address these challenges. Our framework consists of three key designs: 1) Decoupled Encoder and Query Generator to capture decoupled spatial and temporal features and construct a fusion query via residual fusion; 2) Spatio-temporal Retrieval Store and Retrievers to maintain and retrieve vectorized fine-grained patterns; and 3) Universal Backbone Predictor that flexibly accommodates pre-trained STGNNs or simple MLP predictors. Extensive experiments on six real-world traffic networks, including large-scale datasets, demonstrate that RAST achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 (AI for Social Impact)</p></details> |

Building upon foundational statistical work, we apply Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), Negative Binomial Regression, Random Forest classification, and Highway Safety Manual (HSM) Safety Performance Function (SPF) comparisons to identify comprehensive temporal and spatial crash patterns. A Random Forest classifier predicts injury severity with 67\% accuracy, outperforming HSM SPF. Spatial clustering is confirmed via Moran's I test ($I = 0.32$, $p < 0.001$), and KDE analysis reveals hotspots near major intersections, validating and extending earlier hotspot identification methods. These results support targeted interventions to improve traffic safety on this vital transportation corridor. Our objective is to provide actionable insights for improving safety on US 158 while contributing to the broader understanding of rural highway safety analysis through methodological advancement beyond basic statistical techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,7 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

In such applications, uncertainty estimation in forecasting is important because it helps evaluate traffic risk levels, assess forecast reliability, and provide timely warnings. As a result, probabilistic traffic flow forecasting (PTFF) has gained significant attention, as it produces both point forecasts and uncertainty estimates. However, existing PTFF approaches still face two key challenges: (1) how to uncover and model the causes of traffic flow uncertainty for reliable forecasting, and (2) how to capture the spatiotemporal correlations of uncertainty for accurate prediction. To address these challenges, we propose RIPCN, a Road Impedance Principal Component Network that integrates domain-specific transportation theory with spatiotemporal principal component learning for PTFF. RIPCN introduces a dynamic impedance evolution network that captures directional traffic transfer patterns driven by road congestion level and flow variability, revealing the direct causes of uncertainty and enhancing both reliability and interpretability. In addition, a principal component network is designed to forecast the dominant eigenvectors of future flow covariance, enabling the model to capture spatiotemporal uncertainty correlations. This design allows for accurate and efficient uncertainty estimation while also improving point prediction performance. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms existing probabilistic forecasting methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at KDD 2026. 12 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose DMLITE, a diffusion model and large language model (LLM) integrated traffic embedding framework for network traffic detection within resource-limited IoT environments. The DMLITE overcomes these challenges through a tri-phase architecture including traffic visual preprocessing, diffusion-based multi-level feature extraction, and LLM-guided feature optimization. Specifically, the framework utilizes self-supervised diffusion models to capture both fine-grained and abstract patterns in encrypted traffic through multi-level feature fusion and contrastive learning with representative sample selection, thus enabling rapid adaptation to new traffic patterns with minimal labeled data. Furthermore, DMLITE incorporates LLMs to dynamically adjust particle swarm optimization parameters for intelligent feature selection by implementing a dual objective function that minimizes both classification error and variance across data distributions. Comprehensive experimental validation on benchmark datasets confirms the effectiveness of DMLITE, achieving classification accuracies of 98.87\%, 92.61\%, and 99.83\% on USTC-TFC, ISCX-VPN, and Edge-IIoTset datasets, respectively. This improves classification accuracy by an average of 3.7\% and reduces training time by an average of 41.9\% compared to the representative deep learning model.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering</p></details> |

However, efficiently modeling the dynamic interactions between numerous road users and infrastructures in complex scenes remains an open problem. Existing methods typically employ distance-based or fully connected dense graph structures to capture interaction information, which not only introduces a large number of redundant edges but also requires complex and heavily parameterized networks for encoding, thereby resulting in low training and inference efficiency, limiting scalability to large and complex traffic scenes. To overcome the limitations of existing methods, we propose SparScene, a sparse graph learning framework designed for efficient and scalable traffic scene representation. Instead of relying on distance thresholds, SparScene leverages the lane graph topology to construct structure-aware sparse connections between agents and lanes, enabling efficient yet informative scene graph representation. SparScene adopts a lightweight graph encoder that efficiently aggregates agent-map and agent-agent interactions, yielding compact scene representations with substantially improved efficiency and scalability. On the motion prediction benchmark of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), SparScene achieves competitive performance with remarkable efficiency. It generates trajectories for more than 200 agents in a scene within 5 ms and scales to more than 5,000 agents and 17,000 lanes with merely 54 ms of inference time with a GPU memory of 2.9 GB, highlighting its superior scalability for large-scale traffic scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

While existing simulators such as SUMO and MATSim offer fully-featured platforms and utilities, users without too much knowledge about these platforms often face significant challenges when conducting experiments from scratch and applying them to their daily work. To solve this challenge, we propose TrafficSimAgent, an LLM-based agent framework that serves as an expert in experiment design and decision optimization for general-purpose traffic simulation tasks. The framework facilitates execution through cross-level collaboration among expert agents: high-level expert agents comprehend natural language instructions with high flexibility, plan the overall experiment workflow, and invoke corresponding MCP-compatible tools on demand; meanwhile, low-level expert agents select optimal action plans for fundamental elements based on real-time traffic conditions. Extensive experiments across multiple scenarios show that TrafficSimAgent effectively executes simulations under various conditions and consistently produces reasonable outcomes even when user instructions are ambiguous. Besides, the carefully designed expert-level autonomous decision-driven optimization in TrafficSimAgent yields superior performance when compared with other systems and SOTA LLM based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code will be available at: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/TrafficSimAgent</p></details> |

Nevertheless, as the pre-trained models emerge, especially transformer-based classifiers, existing traffic obfuscation methods become increasingly vulnerable, as witnessed by current studies reporting the traffic classification accuracy up to 99\% or higher. To counter such high-performance transformer-based classification models, we in this paper propose a novel and effective \underline{adv}ersarial \underline{traffic}-generating approach (AdvTraffic\footnote{The code and data are available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TrafficD-C461}). Our approach has two key innovations: (i) a pre-padding strategy is proposed to modify packets, which effectively overcomes the limitations of existing research against transformer-based models for network traffic classification; and (ii) a reinforcement learning model is employed to optimize network traffic perturbations, aiming to maximize adversarial effectiveness against transformer-based classification models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply adversarial perturbation techniques to defend against transformer-based traffic classifiers. Furthermore, our method can be easily deployed into practical network environments. Finally, multi-faceted experiments are conducted across several real-world datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively undermine transformer-based classifiers, significantly reducing classification accuracy from 99\% to as low as 25.68\%.</p></details> |  |

| **[BacAlarm: Mining and Simulating Composite API Traffic to Prevent Broken Access Control Violations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19997v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Broken Access Control (BAC) violations, which consistently rank among the top five security risks in the OWASP API Security Top 10, refer to unauthorized access attempts arising from BAC vulnerabilities, whose successful exploitation can impose significant risks on exposed application programming interfaces (APIs). In recent years, learning-based methods have demonstrated promising prospects in detecting various types of malicious activities. However, in real-network operation and maintenance scenarios, leveraging learning-based methods for BAC detection faces two critical challenges. Firstly, under the RESTful API design principles, most systems omit recording composite traffic for performance, and together with ethical and legal bans on directly testing real-world systems, this leads to a critical shortage of training data for detecting BAC violations. Secondly, common malicious behaviors such as SQL injection typically generate individual access traffic that is inherently anomalous. In contrast, BAC is usually composed of multiple correlated access requests that appear normal when examined in isolation. To tackle these problems, we introduce \BAC, an approach for establishing a BAC violation detection model by generating and utilizing API traffic data. The \BAC consists of an API Traffic Generator and a BAC Detector. Experimental results show that \BAC outperforms current state-of-the-art invariant-based and learning-based methods with the $\text{F}_1$ and MCC improving by 21.2\% and 24.1\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The full version of this work consists of 15 pages and has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE)</p></details> |
| **[Interaction Dataset of Autonomous Vehicles with Traffic Lights and Signs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12536v2)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the development of a comprehensive dataset capturing interactions between Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and traffic control devices, specifically traffic lights and stop signs. Derived from the Waymo Motion dataset, our work addresses a critical gap in the existing literature by providing real-world trajectory data on how AVs navigate these traffic control devices. We propose a methodology for identifying and extracting relevant interaction trajectory data from the Waymo Motion dataset, incorporating over 37,000 instances with traffic lights and 44,000 with stop signs. Our methodology includes defining rules to identify various interaction types, extracting trajectory data, and applying a wavelet-based denoising method to smooth the acceleration and speed profiles and eliminate anomalous values, thereby enhancing the trajectory quality. Quality assessment metrics indicate that trajectories obtained in this study have anomaly proportions in acceleration and jerk profiles reduced to near-zero levels across all interaction categories. By making this dataset publicly available, we aim to address the current gap in datasets containing AV interaction behaviors with traffic lights and signs. Based on the organized and published dataset, we can gain a more in-depth understanding of AVs' behavior when interacting with traffic lights and signs. This will facilitate research on AV integration into existing transportation infrastructures and networks, supporting the development of more accurate behavioral models and simulation tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReGAIN: Retrieval-Grounded AI Framework for Network Traffic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22223v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern networks generate vast, heterogeneous traffic that must be continuously analyzed for security and performance. Traditional network traffic analysis systems, whether rule-based or machine learning-driven, often suffer from high false positives and lack interpretability, limiting analyst trust. In this paper, we present ReGAIN, a multi-stage framework that combines traffic summarization, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning for transparent and accurate network traffic analysis. ReGAIN creates natural-language summaries from network traffic, embeds them into a multi-collection vector database, and utilizes a hierarchical retrieval pipeline to ground LLM responses with evidence citations. The pipeline features metadata-based filtering, MMR sampling, a two-stage cross-encoder reranking mechanism, and an abstention mechanism to reduce hallucinations and ensure grounded reasoning. Evaluated on ICMP ping flood and TCP SYN flood traces from the real-world traffic dataset, it demonstrates robust performance, achieving accuracy between 95.95% and 98.82% across different attack types and evaluation benchmarks. These results are validated against two complementary sources: dataset ground truth and human expert assessments. ReGAIN also outperforms rule-based, classical ML, and deep learning baselines while providing unique explainability through trustworthy, verifiable responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICNC 2026.

| **[A Fast Solver-Free Algorithm for Traffic Engineering in Large-Scale Data Center Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04027v3)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid growth of data center networks (DCNs) poses significant challenges for large-scale traffic engineering (TE). Existing acceleration strategies, which rely on commercial solvers or deep learning, face scalability issues and struggle with degrading performance or long computational time. Unlike existing algorithms adopting parallel strategies, we propose Sequential Source-Destination Optimization (SSDO), a sequential solver-free algorithm for TE. SSDO decomposes the problem into subproblems, each focused on adjusting the split ratios for a specific source-destination (SD) demand while keeping others fixed. To enhance the efficiency of subproblem optimization, we design a Balanced Binary Search Method (BBSM), which identifies the most balanced split ratios among multiple solutions that minimize Maximum Link Utilization (MLU). SSDO dynamically updates the sequence of SDs based on real-time utilization, which accelerates convergence and enhances solution quality. We evaluate SSDO on Meta DCNs and two wide-area networks. In a Meta topology, SSDO achieves a 65\% and 60\% reduction in normalized MLU compared to TEAL and POP, two state-of-the-art TE acceleration methods, while delivering a $12\times$ speedup over POP. These results demonstrate the superior performance of SSDO in large-scale TE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 23rd USENIX Symposium on Network Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI '26), to be held in Seattle on May 4-6, 2026</p></details> |
| **[CrashChat: A Multimodal Large Language Model for Multitask Traffic Crash Video Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18878v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automating crash video analysis is essential to leverage the growing availability of driving video data for traffic safety research and accountability attribution in autonomous driving. Crash video analysis is a challenging multitask problem due to the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of crash events in video data and the diverse analytical requirements involved. It requires capabilities spanning crash recognition, temporal grounding, and high-level video understanding. Existing models, however, cannot perform all these tasks within a unified framework, and effective training strategies for such models remain underexplored. To fill these gaps, this paper proposes CrashChat, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) for multitask traffic crash analysis, built upon VideoLLaMA3. CrashChat acquires domain-specific knowledge through instruction fine-tuning and employs a novel multitask learning strategy based on task decoupling and grouping, which maximizes the benefit of joint learning within and across task groups while mitigating negative transfer. Numerical experiments on consolidated public datasets demonstrate that CrashChat consistently outperforms existing MLLMs across model scales and traditional vision-based methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance. It reaches near-perfect accuracy in crash recognition, a 176\% improvement in crash localization, and a 40\% improvement in the more challenging pre-crash localization. Compared to general MLLMs, it substantially enhances textual accuracy and content coverage in crash description and reasoning tasks, with 0.18-0.41 increases in BLEU scores and 0.18-0.42 increases in ROUGE scores. Beyond its strong performance, CrashChat is a convenient, end-to-end analytical tool ready for practical implementation. The dataset and implementation code for CrashChat are available at https://github.com/Liangkd/CrashChat.</p></details> |  |

Using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and the Waymo Open Sim Agents Challenge (WOSAC), we evaluate SUMO under both short-horizon (8s) and long-horizon (60s) closed-loop simulation settings. To enable scalable evaluation, we develop Waymo2SUMO, an automated pipeline that converts WOMD scenarios into SUMO simulations. On the WOSAC benchmark, SUMO achieves a realism meta metric of 0.653 while requiring fewer than 100 tunable parameters. Extended rollouts show that SUMO maintains low collision and offroad rates and exhibits stronger long-horizon stability than representative data-driven simulators. These results highlight complementary strengths of model-based and data-driven approaches for autonomous driving simulation and benchmarking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code is available at https://github.com/LuminousLamp/SUMO-Benchmark</p></details> |
| **[HUTFormer: Hierarchical U-Net Transformer for Long-Term Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14596v2)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting, which aims to predict traffic conditions based on historical observations, has been an enduring research topic and is widely recognized as an essential component of intelligent transportation. Recent proposals on Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks~(STGNNs) have made significant progress by combining sequential models with graph convolution networks. However, due to high complexity issues, STGNNs only focus on short-term traffic forecasting (e.g., 1-h ahead), while ignoring more practical long-term forecasting. In this paper, we make the first attempt to explore long-term traffic forecasting (e.g., 1-day ahead). To this end, we first reveal its unique challenges in exploiting multi-scale representations. Then, we propose a novel Hierarchical U-Net TransFormer~(HUTFormer) to address the issues of long-term traffic forecasting. HUTFormer consists of a hierarchical encoder and decoder to jointly generate and utilize multi-scale representations of traffic data. Specifically, for the encoder, we {\color{black}propose} window self-attention and segment merging to extract multi-scale representations from long-term traffic data. For the decoder, we design a cross-scale attention mechanism to effectively incorporate multi-scale representations. In addition, HUTFormer employs an efficient input embedding strategy to address the complexity issues. Extensive experiments on four traffic datasets show that the proposed HUTFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art traffic forecasting and long time series forecasting baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Communications in Transportation Research on December 2025. 38 paqes with 9 fiqures and 6 tables</p></details> |

Existing WF methods rely on supervised learning with site-specific labeled traces, which limits scalability and fails to handle previously unseen websites. We address these limitations by reformulating WF as a zero-shot cross-modal retrieval problem and introducing STAR. STAR learns a joint embedding space for encrypted traffic traces and crawl-time logic profiles using a dual-encoder architecture. Trained on 150K automatically collected traffic-logic pairs with contrastive and consistency objectives and structure-aware augmentation, STAR retrieves the most semantically aligned profile for a trace without requiring target-side traffic during training. Experiments on 1,600 unseen websites show that STAR achieves 87.9 percent top-1 accuracy and 0.963 AUC in open-world detection, outperforming supervised and few-shot baselines. Adding an adapter with only four labeled traces per site further boosts top-5 accuracy to 98.8 percent. Our analysis reveals intrinsic semantic-traffic alignment in modern web protocols, identifying semantic leakage as the dominant privacy risk in encrypted HTTPS traffic. We release STAR's datasets and code to support reproducibility and future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE INFOCOM 2026.

| **[A Hybrid Inductive-Transductive Network for Traffic Flow Imputation on Unsampled Locations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17984v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately imputing traffic flow at unsensed locations is difficult: loop detectors provide precise but sparse measurements, speed from probe vehicles is widely available yet only weakly correlated with flow, and nearby links often exhibit strong heterophily in the scale of traffic flow (e.g., ramps vs. mainline), which breaks standard GNN assumptions. We propose HINT, a Hybrid INductive-Transductive Network, and an INDU-TRANSDUCTIVE training strategy that treats speed as a transductive, network-wide signal while learning flow inductively to generalize to unseen locations. HINT couples (i) an inductive spatial transformer that learns similarity-driven, long-range interactions from node features with (ii) a diffusion GCN conditioned by FiLM on rich static context (OSM-derived attributes and traffic simulation), and (iii) a node-wise calibration layer that corrects scale biases per segment. Training uses masked reconstruction with epoch-wise node sampling, hard-node mining to emphasize difficult sensors, and noise injection on visible flows to prevent identity mapping, while graph structure is built from driving distances. Across three real-world datasets, MOW (Antwerp, Belgium), UTD19-Torino, and UTD19-Essen, HINT consistently surpasses state-of-the-art inductive baselines. Relative to KITS, HINT reduces MAE on MOW by $\approx42$% with basic simulation and $\approx50$% with calibrated simulation; on Torino by $\approx22$%, and on Essen by $\approx12$%. Even without simulation, HINT remains superior on MOW and Torino, while simulation is crucial on Essen. These results show that combining inductive flow imputation with transductive speed, traffic simulations and external geospatial improves accuracy for the task described above.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Graph Pruning with Sudden-Events Evaluation for Traffic Prediction using Online Semi-Decentralized ST-GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17352v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) are well-suited for processing high-frequency data streams from geographically distributed sensors in smart mobility systems. However, their deployment at the edge across distributed compute nodes (cloudlets) createssubstantial communication overhead due to repeated transmission of overlapping node features between neighbouring cloudlets. To address this, we propose an adaptive pruning algorithm that dynamically filters redundant neighbour features while preserving the most informative spatial context for prediction. The algorithm adjusts pruning rates based on recent model performance, allowing each cloudlet to focus on regions experiencing traffic changes without compromising accuracy. Additionally, we introduce the Sudden Event Prediction Accuracy (SEPA), a novel event-focused metric designed to measure responsiveness to traffic slowdowns and recoveries, which are often missed by standard error metrics. We evaluate our approach in an online semi-decentralized setting with traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning on two large-scale traffic datasets, PeMS-BAY and PeMSD7-M, across short-, mid-, and long-term prediction horizons. Experiments show that, in contrast to standard metrics, SEPA exposes the true value of spatial connectivity in predicting dynamic and irregular traffic. Our adaptive pruning algorithm maintains prediction accuracy while significantly lowering communication cost in all online semi-decentralized settings, demonstrating that communication can be reduced without compromising responsiveness to critical traffic events.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables, journal</p></details> |
| **[Wireless Traffic Prediction with Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22178v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for intelligent, adaptive resource management in next-generation wireless networks has underscored the importance of accurate and scalable wireless traffic prediction. While recent advancements in deep learning and foundation models such as large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising forecasting capabilities, they largely overlook the spatial dependencies inherent in city-scale traffic dynamics. In this paper, we propose TIDES (Traffic Intelligence with DeepSeek-Enhanced Spatial-temporal prediction), a novel LLM-based framework that captures spatial-temporal correlations for urban wireless traffic prediction. TIDES first identifies heterogeneous traffic patterns across regions through a clustering mechanism and trains personalized models for each region to balance generalization and specialization. To bridge the domain gap between numerical traffic data and language-based models, we introduce a prompt engineering scheme that embeds statistical traffic features as structured inputs. Furthermore, we design a DeepSeek module that enables spatial alignment via cross-domain attention, allowing the LLM to leverage information from spatially related regions. By fine-tuning only lightweight components while freezing core LLM layers, TIDES achieves efficient adaptation to domain-specific patterns without incurring excessive training overhead. Extensive experiments on real-world cellular traffic datasets demonstrate that TIDES significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and robustness. Our results indicate that integrating spatial awareness into LLM-based predictors is the key to unlocking scalable and intelligent network management in future 6G systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A simulation platform calibration method for automated vehicle evaluation: accurate on both vehicle level and traffic flow level](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16076v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation testing is a fundamental approach for evaluating automated vehicles (AVs). To ensure its reliability, it is crucial to accurately replicate interactions between AVs and background traffic, which necessitates effective calibration. However, existing calibration methods often fall short in achieving this goal. To address this gap, this study introduces a simulation platform calibration method that ensures high accuracy at both the vehicle and traffic flow levels. The method offers several key features:(1) with the capability of calibration for vehicle-to-vehicle interaction; (2) with accuracy assurance; (3) with enhanced efficiency; (4) with pipeline calibration capability. The proposed method is benchmarked against a baseline with no calibration and a state-of-the-art calibration method. Results show that it enhances the accuracy of interaction replication by 83.53% and boosts calibration efficiency by 76.75%. Furthermore, it maintains accuracy across both vehicle-level and traffic flow-level metrics, with an improvement of 51.9%. Notably, the entire calibration process is fully automated, requiring no human intervention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Multimodal Embeddings for Traffic Accident Prediction and Causal Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02920v2)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider analyzing traffic accident patterns using both road network data and satellite images aligned to road graph nodes. Previous work for predicting accident occurrences relies primarily on road network structural features while overlooking physical and environmental information from the road surface and its surroundings. In this work, we construct a large multimodal dataset across six U.S. states, containing nine million traffic accident records from official sources, and one million high-resolution satellite images for each node of the road network. Additionally, every node is annotated with features such as the region's weather statistics and road type (e.g., residential vs. motorway), and each edge is annotated with traffic volume information (i.e., Average Annual Daily Traffic). Utilizing this dataset, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal learning methods that integrate both visual and network embeddings. Our findings show that integrating both data modalities improves prediction accuracy, achieving an average AUROC of $90.1\%$, which is a $3.7\%$ gain over graph neural network models that only utilize graph structures. With the improved embeddings, we conduct a causal analysis based on a matching estimator to estimate the key contributing factors influencing traffic accidents. We find that accident rates rise by $24\%$ under higher precipitation, by $22\%$ on higher-speed roads such as motorways, and by $29\%$ due to seasonal patterns, after adjusting for other confounding factors. Ablation studies confirm that satellite imagery features are essential for achieving accurate prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages.

| **[Optimal Transport-Based Clustering of Attributed Graphs with an Application to Road Traffic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15570v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many real-world contexts, such as social or transport networks, data exhibit both structural connectivity and node-level attributes. For example, roads in a transport network can be characterized not only by their connectivity but also by traffic flow or speed profiles. Understanding such systems therefore requires jointly analyzing the network structure and node attributes, a challenge addressed by attributed graph partitioning, which clusters nodes based on both connectivity and attributes. In this work, we adapt distance-based methods for this task, including Fréchet $k$-means and optimal transport-based approaches based on Gromov--Wasserstein (GW) discrepancy. We investigate how GW methods, traditionally used for general-purpose tasks such as graph matching, can be specifically adapted for node partitioning, an area that has been relatively underexplored. In the context of node-attributed graphs, we introduce an adaptation of the Fused GW method, offering theoretical guarantees and the ability to handle heterogeneous attribute types. Additionally, we propose to incorporate distance-based embeddings to enhance performance. The proposed approaches are systematically evaluated using a dedicated simulation framework and illustrated on a real-world transportation dataset. Experiments investigate the influence of target choice, assess robustness to noise, and provide practical guidance for attributed graph clustering. In the context of road networks, our results demonstrate that these methods can effectively leverage both structural and attribute information to reveal meaningful clusters, offering insights for improved network understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 14 Figures and 3 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Packet-Level Traffic Modeling with Heavy-Tailed Payload and Inter-Arrival Distributions for Digital Twins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15432v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital twins of radio access networks require packet-level traffic generators that reproduce the size and timing of packets while remaining compact and easy to recalibrate as traffic changes. We address this need with a hybrid generator that combines a small hidden Markov model, which captures buffering, streaming, and idle states, with a mixture density network that models the joint distribution of payload length and inter-arrival time (IAT) in each state using Student-t mixtures. The state space and emission family are designed to handle heavy-tailed IAT by anchoring an explicit idle state in the tail and allowing each component to adapt its tail thickness. We evaluate the model on public traces of web, smart home, and encrypted media traffic and compare it with recent neural network and transformer based generators as well as hidden Markov baselines. Across most datasets and metrics, including average per-flow cumulative distribution functions, autocorrelation based measures of temporal structure, and Wasserstein distances between flow descriptors, the proposed generator matches the real traffic most closely in the majority of cases while using orders of magnitude fewer parameters. The full model occupies around 0.2 MB in our experiments, which makes it suitable for deployment inside digital twins where memory footprint and low-overhead adaptation are critical.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[TrafficGamer: Reliable and Flexible Traffic Simulation for Safety-Critical Scenarios with Game-Theoretic Oracles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15538v3)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While modern Autonomous Vehicle (AV) systems can develop reliable driving policies under regular traffic conditions, they frequently struggle with safety-critical traffic scenarios. This difficulty primarily arises from the rarity of such scenarios in driving datasets and the complexities associated with predictive modeling of multiple vehicles. Effectively simulating safety-critical traffic situations is therefore a crucial challenge. In this paper, we introduce TrafficGamer, which facilitates game-theoretic traffic simulation by viewing common road driving as a multi-agent game. When we evaluate the empirical performance across various real-world datasets, TrafficGamer ensures both the fidelity, exploitability, and diversity of the simulated scenarios, guaranteeing that they not only statically align with real-world traffic distribution but also efficiently capture equilibria for representing safety-critical scenarios involving multiple agents compared with other methods. Additionally, the results demonstrate that TrafficGamer provides highly flexible simulations across various contexts. Specifically, we demonstrate that the generated scenarios can dynamically adapt to equilibria of varying tightness by configuring risk-sensitive constraints during optimization. We have provided a demo webpage at: https://anonymous.4open.science/api/repo/trafficgamer-demo-1EE0/file/index.html.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measuring Nonlinear Relationships and Spatial Heterogeneity of Influencing Factors on Traffic Crash Density Using GeoXAI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14985v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study applies a Geospatial Explainable AI (GeoXAI) framework to analyze the spatially heterogeneous and nonlinear determinants of traffic crash density in Florida. By combining a high-performing machine learning model with GeoShapley, the framework provides interpretable, tract-level insights into how roadway characteristics and socioeconomic factors contribute to crash risk. Specifically, results show that variables such as road density, intersection density, neighborhood compactness, and educational attainment exhibit complex nonlinear relationships with crashes. Extremely dense urban areas, such as Miami, show sharply elevated crash risk due to intensified pedestrian activities and roadway complexity. The GeoShapley approach also captures strong spatial heterogeneity in the influence of these factors. Major metropolitan areas including Miami, Orlando, Tampa, and Jacksonville display significantly higher intrinsic crash contributions, while rural tracts generally have lower baseline risk. Each factor exhibits pronounced spatial variation across the state. Based on these findings, the study proposes targeted, geography-sensitive policy recommendations, including traffic calming in compact neighborhoods, adaptive intersection design, speed management on high-volume corridors such as I-95 in Miami, and equity-focused safety interventions in disadvantaged rural areas of central and northern Florida. Moreover, this paper compares the results obtained from GeoShapley framework against other established methods (e.g., SHAP and MGWR), demonstrating its powerful ability to explain nonlinearity and spatial heterogeneity simultaneously.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network for Urban Spaces: Interpolating Citywide Traffic Volume](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06292v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks have shown strong performance in traffic volume forecasting, particularly on highways and major arterial networks. Applying them to urban settings, however, presents unique challenges: urban networks exhibit greater structural diversity, traffic volumes are highly overdispersed with many zeros, the best way to account for spatial dependencies remains unclear, and sensor coverage is often very sparse. We introduce the Graph Neural Network for Urban Interpolation (GNNUI), a novel urban traffic volume estimation approach. GNNUI employs a masking algorithm to learn interpolation, integrates node features to capture functional roles, and uses a loss function tailored to zero-inflated traffic distributions. In addition to the model, we introduce two new open, large-scale urban traffic volume benchmarks, covering different transportation modes: Strava cycling data from Berlin and New York City taxi data. GNNUI outperforms recent, some graph-based, interpolation methods across metrics (MAE, RMSE, true-zero rate, Kullback-Leibler divergence) and remains robust from 90% to 1% sensor coverage. For example, on the Strava dataset, the MAE increases only from 7.1 to 10.5, and on the Taxi dataset, from 23.0 to 40.4. These results demonstrate that GNNUI maintains strong performance despite extreme data scarcity, a common condition in real-world urban settings. We also examine how graph connectivity choices influence model accuracy.</p></details> |  |

The introduction of low-carbon energy carriers and the deployment of new aircraft in the current fleet are modeled as technology-centered decarbonization policies, while supply constraints in targeted market segments are modeled as demand-side policies. Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) are used to estimate trend-mitigation traffic demand and to limit the sectoral consumption of electricity and biomass. Mitigation scenarios are formulated as optimization problems, and three applications are demonstrated: no-policy baselines, single-policy optimization, and scenario-robust policies. Results show that the choice of energy carrier is highly dependent on assumptions regarding aircraft technology and the background energy system. Across all SSP-based scenarios, emissions peak by around 2040, but achieving alignment with the Paris Agreement requires either targeted demand management or additional low-carbon energy supply. The use of gradient-based optimization within a multidisciplinary framework enables the efficient resolution of these nonlinear, high-dimensional problems while reducing implementation effort.</p></details> |  |

Existing sequence modeling approaches can be broadly categorized into flow-level and trace-level methods: the former suffer from high feature redundancy, limiting their discriminative power, whereas the latter preserve complete information but incur substantial computational and storage overhead. To address these limitations, we propose the \textbf{U}p-\textbf{D}own \textbf{F}low \textbf{S}equence (\textbf{UDFS}) representation, which compresses an entire trace into a two-dimensional sequence and characterizes each flow by the aggregate of its upstream and downstream traffic, reducing complexity while maintaining high discriminability. Furthermore, to address the challenge of class-specific discriminability differences, we propose an adaptive threshold mechanism that dynamically adjusts training weights and rejection boundaries, enhancing the model's classification performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior classification performance and robustness on both coarse-grained and fine-grained datasets, as well as under concept drift and open-world scenarios.

| **[Optimizing Highway Traffic Flow in Mixed Autonomy: A Multiagent Truncated Rollout Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19203v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offers substantial opportunities to enhance traffic efficiency. However, in mixed autonomy environments where CAVs coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs), achieving efficient coordination among CAVs remains challenging due to heterogeneous driving behaviors. To address this, this paper proposes a multiagent truncated rollout approach that enhances CAV speed coordination to improve highway throughput while reducing computational overhead. In this approach, a traffic density evolution equation is formulated that comprehensively accounts for the presence or absence of CAVs, and a distributed coordination control framework is established accordingly. By incorporating kinematic information from neighbor agents and employing an agent-by-agent sequential solution mechanism, our method enables explicit cooperation among CAVs. Furthermore, we introduce a truncated rollout scheme that adaptively shortens the optimization horizon based on the evaluation of control sequences. This significantly reduces the time complexity, thereby improving real-time performance and scalability. Theoretical analysis provides rigorous guarantees on the stability and performance improvement of the system. Simulations conducted on real-world bottleneck scenarios demonstrate that, in large-scale mixed traffic flows, the proposed method outperforms conventional model predictive control methods by reducing both the average travel time in the bottleneck area and overall computational time, highlighting its strong potential for practical deployment.</p></details> |  |

Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is an effective strategy for enhancing safety at these urban junctures. Despite the growing popularity of Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods in optimizing TSC, these methods often prioritize driving efficiency over safety, thus failing to address the critical balance between these two aspects. Additionally, these methods usually need more interpretability. CounterFactual (CF) learning is a promising approach for various causal analysis fields. In this study, we introduce a novel framework to improve RL for safety aspects in TSC. This framework introduces a novel method based on CF learning to address the question: ``What if, when an unsafe event occurs, we backtrack to perform alternative actions, and will this unsafe event still occur in the subsequent period?'' To answer this question, we propose a new structure causal model to predict the result after executing different actions, and we propose a new CF module that integrates with additional ``X'' modules to promote safe RL practices. Our new algorithm, CFLight, which is derived from this framework, effectively tackles challenging safety events and significantly improves safety at intersections through a near-zero collision control strategy. Through extensive numerical experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that CFLight reduces collisions and improves overall traffic performance compared to conventional RL methods and the recent safe RL model. Moreover, our method represents a generalized and safe framework for RL methods, opening possibilities for applications in other domains. The data and code are available in the github https://github.com/AdvancedAI-ComplexSystem/SmartCity/tree/main/CFLight.</p></details> |  |
| **[CrossTrafficLLM: A Human-Centric Framework for Interpretable Traffic Intelligence via Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06042v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While accurate traffic forecasting is vital for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), effectively communicating predicted conditions via natural language for human-centric decision support remains a challenge and is often handled separately. To address this, we propose CrossTrafficLLM, a novel GenAI-driven framework that simultaneously predicts future spatiotemporal traffic states and generates corresponding natural language descriptions, specifically targeting conditional abnormal event summaries. We tackle the core challenge of aligning quantitative traffic data with qualitative textual semantics by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) within a unified architecture. This design allows generative textual context to improve prediction accuracy while ensuring generated reports are directly informed by the forecast. Technically, a text-guided adaptive graph convolutional network is employed to effectively merge high-level semantic information with the traffic network structure. Evaluated on the BJTT dataset, CrossTrafficLLM demonstrably surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both traffic forecasting performance and text generation quality. By unifying prediction and description generation, CrossTrafficLLM delivers a more interpretable, and actionable approach to generative traffic intelligence, offering significant advantages for modern ITS applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Network-Wide Traffic Volume Estimation from Speed Profiles using a Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network with Directed Spatial Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13758v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing traffic volume estimation methods typically address either forecasting traffic on sensor-equipped roads or spatially imputing missing volumes using nearby sensors. While forecasting models generally disregard unmonitored roads by design, spatial imputation methods explicitly address network-wide estimation; yet this approach relies on volume data at inference time, limiting its applicability in sensor-scarce cities. Unlike traffic volume data, probe vehicle speeds and static road attributes are more broadly accessible and support full coverage of road segments in most urban networks. In this work, we present the Hybrid Directed-Attention Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (HDA-STGNN), an inductive deep learning framework designed to tackle the network-wide volume estimation problem. Our approach leverages speed profiles, static road attributes, and road network topology to predict daily traffic volume profiles across all road segments in the network. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we perform extensive ablation studies that demonstrate the model's capacity to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies and highlight the value of topological information for accurate network-wide traffic volume estimation without relying on volume data at inference time.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Digital Life of Parisian Parks: Multifunctionality and Urban Context Uncovered by Mobile Application Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15516v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban parks support public health, but landscape architecture typically examines them through form and function. Prior equitable access research focused on park form, while functional studies relied on small-scale surveys, movement data, or broad usage metrics, missing specific activities and visit motivations. This gap limits our grasp of parks' functional diversity. We address this with a novel method refining mobile base station coverage via antenna azimuths to isolate park-specific traffic from surroundings. Using Paris as a case study, we process 492 million hourly per-app mobile records (35% market share) from 45 urban parks. We test the central-city hypothesis (multifunctional parks in dense, high-rent zones due to land constraints) and socio-spatial hypothesis (parks reflecting neighborhood routines and preferences). Results reveal parks' unique mobile traffic signatures, distinct from urban contexts and each other. Clustering by temporal and app patterns identifies three types: lunchbreak, cultural, and recreational parks, linked to health-promoting visitation motives. Central parks show diverse apps and peak usage; suburban recreational parks mirror local demographics, like income-aligned app preferences. This demonstrates mobile traffic's power as a proxy for urban green space activities, with key implications for park design, public health, and well-being strategies.</p></details> |  |

A detailed representation of the future traffic scenario is of significant importance for autonomous driving and for all active safety systems. In order to predict the future space-time representation of the traffic scenario, first the type of traffic scenario is identified and then the machine learning algorithm maps the current state of the scenario to possible future states. The input to the machine learning algorithms is the current state representation of a traffic scenario, termed as the Augmented Occupancy Grid (AOG). The output is the probabilistic space-time representation which includes uncertainties regarding the behaviour of the traffic participants and is termed as the Predicted Occupancy Grid (POG). The novel architecture consists of two Stacked Denoising Autoencoders (SDAs) and a set of Random Forests. It is then compared with the other two existing architectures that comprise of SDAs and DeconvNet. The architectures are validated with the help of simulations and the comparisons are made both in terms of accuracy and computational time. Also, a brief overview on the applications of POGs in the field of active safety is presented.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal of Advances in Information Technology</p></details> |
| **[Optimal Traffic Relief Road Design using Bilevel Programming and Greedy Seeded Simulated Annealing: A Case Study of Kinshasa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00804v1)** | 2025-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: The city of Kinshasa faces severe traffic congestion, requiring strategic infrastructure capacity enhancements. Although a comprehensive master plan has been proposed, its implementation requires substantial financial investment, which remains constrained in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), an emerging economy. This research proposes a traffic flow based algorithm to support the development of priority road segments. The objective is to enable more effective prioritisation of road construction projects and facilitate the optimal allocation of limited infrastructure budgets. Methods: The study was conducted by formulating a standard transport network design problem (TNDP) that included estimated origin demand data specific to the city of Kinshasa. Given the high computational nature of the 30 node network design, TNDP relevant metaheuristics (GA, ACO, PSO, SA, TS, Greedy) were used selectively and hybridised to achieve high quality, stable solutions. A greedy search seeded simulated annealing and Tabu search were devised to achieve the design goals. Results: Greedy Simulated Annealing and Greedy Tabu search yielded the best travel time reduction and the most stable solutions compared to other solvers, also improving network edge betweenness centrality by nearly a scale of two and a half. Conclusions: Road priorities were proposed, including junctions connecting the Bandundu and Kongo Central entry point to main attraction centres (Limete Poids Lourd, Gombe, Airport) and additional inner city areas (Ngaliema, Selembao, Lemba, Masina, Kimwenza).</p></details> |  |

In this problem, instead of computing the edge p-Laplacian centrality directly which is the very hard problem, we convert the air traffic network to the line graph. Finally, we will compute the node p-Laplacian centrality of the line graph which is equivalent to the edge p-Laplacian of the air traffic network. In this paper, the novel un-normalized graph (p-) Laplacian based ranking method will be developed based on the un-normalized graph p-Laplacian operator definitions such as the curvature operator of graph (i.e. the un-normalized graph 1-Laplacian operator) and will be used to compute the node p-Laplacian centrality of the line graph. The results from the experiments show that the un-normalized graph p-Laplacian ranking methods can be implemented successfully.</p></details> | 7 pages |

We study how to strategically place EV chargers to reduce congestion using two equilibrium models: one based on congestion games and one based on an atomic queueing simulation. We apply both models within a scalable greedy station-placement algorithm. Experiments show that this greedy scheme yields optimal or near-optimal congestion outcomes in realistic networks, even though global optimality is not guaranteed as we show with a counterexample. We also show that the queueing-based approach yields more realistic results than the congestion-game model, and we present a unified methodology that calibrates congestion delays from queue simulation and solves equilibrium in link-space.</p></details> |  |

| **[Predicting Healthcare System Visitation Flow by Integrating Hospital Attributes and Population Socioeconomics with Human Mobility Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15977v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare visitation patterns are influenced by a complex interplay of hospital attributes, population socioeconomics, and spatial factors. However, existing research often adopts a fragmented approach, examining these determinants in isolation. This study addresses this gap by integrating hospital capacities, occupancy rates, reputation, and popularity with population SES and spatial mobility patterns to predict visitation flows and analyze influencing factors. Utilizing four years of SafeGraph mobility data and user experience data from Google Maps Reviews, five flow prediction models, Naive Regression, Gradient Boosting, Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), Deep Gravity, and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNN),were trained and applied to simulate visitation flows in Houston, Texas, U.S. The Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis and the Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) method were employed to examine the combined impacts of different factors on visitation patterns. The findings reveal that Deep Gravity outperformed other models. Hospital capacities, ICU occupancy rates, ratings, and popularity significantly influence visitation patterns, with their effects varying across different travel distances. Short-distance visits are primarily driven by convenience, whereas long-distance visits are influenced by hospital ratings. White-majority areas exhibited lower sensitivity to hospital ratings for short-distance visits, while Asian populations and those with higher education levels prioritized hospital rating in their visitation decisions. SES further influence these patterns, as areas with higher proportions of Hispanic, Black, under-18, and over-65 populations tend to have more frequent hospital visits, potentially reflecting greater healthcare needs or limited access to alternative medical services.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks, Deep Reinforcement Learning and Probabilistic Topic Modeling for Strategic Multiagent Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10501v4)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper provides a comprehensive review of mainly GNN, DRL, and PTM methods with a focus on their potential incorporation in strategic multiagent settings. We draw interest in (i) ML methods currently utilized for uncovering unknown model structures adaptable to the task of strategic opponent modeling, and (ii) the integration of these methods with Game Theoretic concepts that avoid relying on assumptions often invalid in real-world scenarios, such as the Common Prior Assumption (CPA) and the Self-Interest Hypothesis (SIH). We analyze the ability to handle uncertainty and heterogeneity, two characteristics that are very common in real-world application cases, as well as scalability. As a potential answer to effectively modeling relationships and interactions in multiagent settings, we champion the use of GNN. Such approaches are designed to operate upon graph-structured data, and have been shown to be a very powerful tool for performing tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Next, we review the domain of RL, and in particular that of multiagent deep reinforcement learning. Single-agent deep RL has been widely used for decision making in demanding game settings. Its application in multiagent settings though is hindered due to, e.g., varying relationships between agents, and non-stationarity of the environment. We describe existing relevant game theoretic solution concepts, and consider properties such as fairness and stability. Our review comes complete with a note on the literature that utilizes probabilistic topic modeling (PTM) in domains other than that of document analysis and classification. Finally, we identify certain open challenges -- specifically, the need to (i) fit non-stationary environments, (ii) balance the degrees of stability and adaptation, (iii) tackle uncertainty and heterogeneity, (iv) guarantee scalability and solution tractability.</p></details> | 28 pages |
| **[Communication-efficient Federated Graph Classification via Generative Diffusion Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15722v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) unlock new ways of learning from graph-structured data, proving highly effective in capturing complex relationships and patterns. Federated GNNs (FGNNs) have emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm for training GNNs over decentralized data. However, FGNNs face two significant challenges: high communication overhead from multiple rounds of parameter exchanges and non-IID data characteristics across clients. To address these issues, we introduce CeFGC, a novel FGNN paradigm that facilitates efficient GNN training over non-IID data by limiting communication between the server and clients to three rounds only. The core idea of CeFGC is to leverage generative diffusion models to minimize direct client-server communication. Each client trains a generative diffusion model that captures its local graph distribution and shares this model with the server, which then redistributes it back to all clients. Using these generative models, clients generate synthetic graphs combined with their local graphs to train local GNN models. Finally, clients upload their model weights to the server for aggregation into a global GNN model. We theoretically analyze the I/O complexity of communication volume to show that CeFGC reduces to a constant of three communication rounds only. Extensive experiments on several real graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CeFGC against state-of-the-art competitors, reflecting our superior performance on non-IID graphs by aligning local and global model objectives and enriching the training set with diverse graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Code Analysis via Graph-Guided Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12890v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced code analysis tasks, yet they struggle to detect malicious behaviors fragmented across files, whose intricate dependencies easily get lost in the vast amount of benign code. We therefore propose a graph-centric attention acquisition pipeline that enhances LLMs' ability to localize malicious behavior. The approach parses a project into a code graph, uses an LLM to encode nodes with semantic and structural signals, and trains a Graph Neural Network (GNN) under sparse supervision. The GNN performs an initial detection, and by interpreting these predictions, identifies key code sections that are most likely to contain malicious behavior. These influential regions are then used to guide the LLM's attention for in-depth analysis. This strategy significantly reduces interference from irrelevant context while maintaining low annotation costs. Extensive experiments show that the method consistently outperforms existing approaches on multiple public and custom datasets, highlighting its potential for practical deployment in software security scenarios.</p></details> |  |

| **[Multi-Targeted Graph Backdoor Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15474v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural network (GNN) have demonstrated exceptional performance in solving critical problems across diverse domains yet remain susceptible to backdoor attacks. Existing studies on backdoor attack for graph classification are limited to single target attack using subgraph replacement based mechanism where the attacker implants only one trigger into the GNN model. In this paper, we introduce the first multi-targeted backdoor attack for graph classification task, where multiple triggers simultaneously redirect predictions to different target labels. Instead of subgraph replacement, we propose subgraph injection which preserves the structure of the original graphs while poisoning the clean graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, where our attack achieves high attack success rates for all target labels with minimal impact on the clean accuracy. Experimental results on five dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our attack framework compared to the conventional subgraph replacement-based attack. Our analysis on four GNN models confirms the generalization capability of our attack which is effective regardless of the GNN model architectures and training parameters settings. We further investigate the impact of the attack design parameters including injection methods, number of connections, trigger sizes, trigger edge density and poisoning ratios. Additionally, our evaluation against state-of-the-art defenses (randomized smoothing and fine-pruning) demonstrates the robustness of our proposed multi-target attacks. This work highlights the GNN vulnerability against multi-targeted backdoor attack in graph classification task. Our source codes will be available at https://github.com/SiSL-URI/Multi-Targeted-Graph-Backdoor-Attack.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Router to Route Them All: Homogeneous Expert Routing for Heterogeneous Graph Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07603v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common practice in heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) is to condition parameters on node/edge types, assuming types reflect semantic roles. However, this can cause overreliance on surface-level labels and impede cross-type knowledge transfer. We explore integrating Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) into HGNNs--a direction underexplored despite MoE's success in homogeneous settings. Crucially, we question the need for type-specific experts. We propose Homogeneous Expert Routing (HER), an MoE layer for Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGT) that stochastically masks type embeddings during routing to encourage type-agnostic specialization. Evaluated on IMDB, ACM, and DBLP for link prediction, HER consistently outperforms standard HGT and a type-separated MoE baseline. Analysis on IMDB shows HER experts specialize by semantic patterns (e.g., movie genres) rather than node types, confirming routing is driven by latent semantics. Our work demonstrates that regularizing type dependence in expert routing yields more generalizable, efficient, and interpretable representations--a new design principle for heterogeneous graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has been withdrawn by the authors due to significant revisions in preparation for conference submission.

| **[Pb4U-GNet: Resolution-Adaptive Garment Simulation via Propagation-before-Update Graph Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15110v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Garment simulation is fundamental to various applications in computer vision and graphics, from virtual try-on to digital human modelling. However, conventional physics-based methods remain computationally expensive, hindering their application in time-sensitive scenarios. While graph neural networks (GNNs) offer promising acceleration, existing approaches exhibit poor cross-resolution generalisation, demonstrating significant performance degradation on higher-resolution meshes beyond the training distribution. This stems from two key factors: (1) existing GNNs employ fixed message-passing depth that fails to adapt information aggregation to mesh density variation, and (2) vertex-wise displacement magnitudes are inherently resolution-dependent in garment simulation. To address these issues, we introduce Propagation-before-Update Graph Network (Pb4U-GNet), a resolution-adaptive framework that decouples message propagation from feature updates. Pb4U-GNet incorporates two key mechanisms: (1) dynamic propagation depth control, adjusting message-passing iterations based on mesh resolution, and (2) geometry-aware update scaling, which scales predictions according to local mesh characteristics. Extensive experiments show that even trained solely on low-resolution meshes, Pb4U-GNet exhibits strong generalisability across diverse mesh resolutions, addressing a fundamental challenge in neural garment simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

GNN quantization has emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and accelerating inference in resource-constrained environments. Compared to quantization in LLMs, quantizing graph features is more emphasized in GNNs. Inspired by the above, we propose to leverage prompt learning, which manipulates the input data, to improve the performance of quantization-aware training (QAT) for GNNs. To mitigate the issue that prompting the node features alone can only make part of the quantized aggregation result optimal, we introduce Low-Rank Aggregation Prompting (LoRAP), which injects lightweight, input-dependent prompts into each aggregated feature to optimize the results of quantized aggregations. Extensive evaluations on 4 leading QAT frameworks over 9 graph datasets demonstrate that LoRAP consistently enhances the performance of low-bit quantized GNNs while introducing a minimal computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

We present a federated learning framework for brain tumor localization that enables multi-institutional collaboration without sharing sensitive patient data. Our method extends a hybrid Transformer-Graph Neural Network architecture derived from prior decoder-free supervoxel GNNs and is deployed within CAFEIN\textsuperscript{\textregistered}, CERN's federated learning platform designed for healthcare environments. We provide an explainability analysis through Transformer attention mechanisms that reveals which MRI modalities drive the model predictions. Experiments on the BraTS dataset demonstrate a key finding: while isolated training on individual client data triggers early stopping well before reaching full training capacity, federated learning enables continued model improvement by leveraging distributed data, ultimately matching centralized performance. This result provides strong justification for federated learning when dealing with complex tasks and high-dimensional input data, as aggregating knowledge from multiple institutions significantly benefits the learning process. Our explainability analysis, validated through rigorous statistical testing on the full test set (paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction), reveals that deeper network layers significantly increase attention to T2 and FLAIR modalities ($p<0.001$, Cohen's $d$=1.50), aligning with clinical practice.</p></details> |  |

This report presents the ExPrIS project, which addresses this challenge by investigating how knowledge-level expectations can serve as to improve object interpretation from sensor data. Our approach is based on the incremental construction of a 3D Semantic Scene Graph (3DSSG). We integrate expectations from two sources: contextual priors from past observations and semantic knowledge from external graphs like ConceptNet. These are embedded into a heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (GNN) to create an expectation-biased inference process. This method moves beyond static, frame-by-frame analysis to enhance the robustness and consistency of scene understanding over time. The report details this architecture, its evaluation, and outlines its planned integration on a mobile robotic platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has not undergone peer review or any post-submission improvements or corrections.

However, their computational cost becomes prohibitive for repeated queries and large-scale 3D scenarios. Recent purely data-driven networks improve efficiency, yet they often bypass this scattering mechanism, which may compromise physical consistency and generalization. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose U-PINet, a fully end-to-end, physics-informed hierarchical network for efficient RCS prediction via 3D electromagnetic scattering reconstruction. Once the scattering quantities are reconstructed, scattered fields and RCS can be evaluated for arbitrary observation directions via the radiation integral. U-PINet explicitly learns physics-consistent intermediate scattering representations by modeling local electromagnetic coupling and long-range radiation effects through a hierarchical operator design inspired by near-far field decomposition in fast solvers. A physics-guided graph neural network is incorporated to capture self- and mutual-coupling among mesh elements of complex targets, enabling physically interpretable intermediate representations. By embedding governing equations as residual constraints, U-PINet enables accurate object reconstruction of scattering quantities and consequently reliable RCS prediction across observation directions, while significantly reducing runtime. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that U-PINet achieves EM-solver-level RCS accuracy and 3D object reconstruction with orders-of-magnitude speedups, and generalizes well to unseen geometries under limited training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to an Elsevier Journal</p></details> |

Here we want to tackle the question of how and to which extent can one regress scale-free processes, i.e. processes displaying power law behavior, like earthquakes or avalanches? We are interested in predicting the large ones, i.e. rare events in the training set which therefore require extrapolation capabilities of the model. For this we consider two paradigmatic problems that are statistically self-similar. The first one is a 2-dimensional fractional Gaussian field obeying linear dynamics, self-similar by construction and amenable to exact analysis. The second one is the Abelian sandpile model, exhibiting self-organized criticality. The emerging paradigm of Geometric Deep Learning shows that including known symmetries into the model's architecture is key to success. Here one may hope to extrapolate only by leveraging scale invariance. This is however a peculiar symmetry, as it involves possibly non-trivial coarse-graining operations and anomalous scaling. We perform experiments on various existing architectures like U-net, Riesz network (scale invariant by construction), or our own proposals: a wavelet-decomposition based Graph Neural Network (with discrete scale symmetry), a Fourier embedding layer and a Fourier-Mellin Neural Operator. Based on these experiments and a complete characterization of the linear case, we identify the main issues relative to spectral biases and coarse-grained representations, and discuss how to alleviate them with the relevant inductive biases.</p></details> | 29p, 22 figures |
| **[FSX: Message Flow Sensitivity Enhanced Structural Explainer for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14730v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the widespread success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), understanding the reasons behind their specific predictions remains challenging. Existing explainability methods face a trade-off that gradient-based approaches are computationally efficient but often ignore structural interactions, while game-theoretic techniques capture interactions at the cost of high computational overhead and potential deviation from the model's true reasoning path. To address this gap, we propose FSX (Message Flow Sensitivity Enhanced Structural Explainer), a novel hybrid framework that synergistically combines the internal message flows of the model with a cooperative game approach applied to the external graph data. FSX first identifies critical message flows via a novel flow-sensitivity analysis: during a single forward pass, it simulates localized node perturbations and measures the resulting changes in message flow intensities. These sensitivity-ranked flows are then projected onto the input graph to define compact, semantically meaningful subgraphs. Within each subgraph, a flow-aware cooperative game is conducted, where node contributions are evaluated fairly through a Shapley-like value that incorporates both node-feature importance and their roles in sustaining or destabilizing the identified critical flows. Extensive evaluation across multiple datasets and GNN architectures demonstrates that FSX achieves superior explanation fidelity with significantly reduced runtime, while providing unprecedented insights into the structural logic underlying model predictions--specifically, how important sub-structures exert influence by governing the stability of key internal computational pathways.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, Preprint</p></details> |

These methods enrich user representations by incorporating social network information into GCF, thereby integrating additional collaborative signals from social relations. However, existing GCF and graph-based SocialRec approaches face significant challenges: they incur high computational costs and suffer from limited scalability due to the large number of parameters required to assign explicit embeddings to all users and items. In this work, we propose PULSE (Parameter-efficient User representation Learning with Social Knowledge), a framework that addresses this limitation by constructing user representations from socially meaningful signals without creating an explicit learnable embedding for each user. PULSE reduces the parameter size by up to 50% compared to the most lightweight GCF baseline. Beyond parameter efficiency, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming 13 GCF and graph-based social recommendation baselines across varying levels of interaction sparsity, from cold-start to highly active users, through a time- and memory-efficient modeling process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WWW 2026, 12pages</p></details> |

We introduce GraphPerf-RT, a graph neural network surrogate achieving deep learning accuracy at heuristic speeds (2-7ms). GraphPerf-RT is, to our knowledge, the first to unify task DAG topology, CFG-derived code semantics, and runtime context (per-core DVFS, thermal state, utilization) in a heterogeneous graph with typed edges encoding precedence, placement, and contention. Evidential regression with Normal-Inverse-Gamma priors provides calibrated uncertainty; we validate on makespan prediction for risk-aware scheduling. Experiments on three ARM platforms (Jetson TX2, Orin NX, RUBIK Pi) achieve R^2 = 0.81 on log-transformed makespan with Spearman rho = 0.95 and conservative uncertainty calibration (PICP = 99.9% at 95% confidence). Integration with four RL methods demonstrates that multi-agent model-based RL with GraphPerf-RT as the world model achieves 66% makespan reduction and 82% energy reduction versus model-free baselines, with zero thermal violations.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 4 figures, 19 tables</p></details> |
| **[Re-understanding Graph Unlearning through Memorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14694v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph unlearning (GU), which removes nodes, edges, or features from trained graph neural networks (GNNs), is crucial in Web applications where graph data may contain sensitive, mislabeled, or malicious information. However, existing GU methods lack a clear understanding of the key factors that determine unlearning effectiveness, leading to three fundamental limitations: (1) impractical and inaccurate GU difficulty assessment due to test-access requirements and invalid assumptions, (2) ineffectiveness on hard-to-unlearn tasks, and (3) misaligned evaluation protocols that overemphasize easy tasks and fail to capture true forgetting capability. To address these issues, we establish GNN memorization as a new perspective for understanding graph unlearning and propose MGU, a Memorization-guided Graph Unlearning framework. MGU achieves three key advances: it provides accurate and practical difficulty assessment across different GU tasks, develops an adaptive strategy that dynamically adjusts unlearning objectives based on difficulty levels, and establishes a comprehensive evaluation protocol that aligns with practical requirements. Extensive experiments on ten real-world graphs demonstrate that MGU consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in forgetting quality, computational efficiency, and utility preservation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by WWW-2026</p></details> |

We show that graph-based machine learning emulators can learn the spatiotemporal evolution of electromagnetic fields and lower order moments of ion velocity distribution in the near-Earth space environment from four 5D Vlasiator runs performed with identical steady solar wind conditions. The initial ion number density is systematically varied, while the grid spacing is held constant, to scan the ratio of the characteristic ion skin depth to the numerical grid size. Using a graph neural network architecture operating on the 2D spatial simulation grid comprising 670k cells, we demonstrate that both a deterministic forecasting model (Graph-FM) and a probabilistic ensemble forecasting model (Graph-EFM) based on a latent variable formulation are capable of producing accurate predictions of future plasma states. A divergence penalty is incorporated during training to encourage divergence-freeness in the magnetic fields and improve physical consistency. For the probabilistic model, a continuous ranked probability score objective is added to improve the calibration of the ensemble forecasts. When trained, the emulators achieve more than two orders of magnitude speedup in generating the next time step relative to the original simulation on a single GPU compared to 100 CPUs for the Vlasiator runs, while closely matching physical magnetospheric response of the different runs. These results demonstrate that machine learning offers a way to make hybrid-Vlasov simulation tractable for real-time use while providing forecast uncertainty.</p></details> |  |

While strong tabular models remain highly competitive in credit scoring, they may fail to explicitly capture cross-entity dependencies embedded in multi-table financial histories. In this work, we construct a massive-scale heterogeneous graph containing over 31 million nodes and more than 50 million edges, integrating borrower attributes with granular transaction-level entities such as installment payments, POS cash balances, and credit card histories. We evaluate heterogeneous graph neural networks (GNNs), including heterogeneous GraphSAGE and a relation-aware attentive heterogeneous GNN, against strong tabular baselines. We find that standalone GNNs provide limited lift over a competitive gradient-boosted tree baseline, while a hybrid ensemble that augments tabular features with GNN-derived customer embeddings achieves the best overall performance, improving both ROC-AUC and PR-AUC. We further observe that contrastive pretraining can improve optimization stability but yields limited downstream gains under generic graph augmentations. Finally, we conduct structured explainability and fairness analyses to characterize how relational signals affect subgroup behavior and screening-oriented outcomes.</p></details> |  |

However, their high dimensionality, small sample sizes, and intricate biological networks pose major challenges for reliable prediction and meaningful interpretation. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a promising way to integrate prior knowledge by encoding feature relationships as graphs. Yet, existing methods typically rely solely on either an externally curated feature graph or a data-driven generated one, which limits their ability to capture complementary information. To address this, we propose the external and generated Graph Neural Network (engGNN), a dual-graph framework that jointly leverages both external known biological networks and data-driven generated graphs. Specifically, engGNN constructs a biologically informed undirected feature graph from established network databases and complements it with a directed feature graph derived from tree-ensemble models. This dual-graph design produces more comprehensive embeddings, thereby improving predictive performance and interpretability. Through extensive simulations and real-world applications to gene expression data, engGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Beyond classification, engGNN provides interpretable feature importance scores that facilitate biologically meaningful discoveries, such as pathway enrichment analysis. Taken together, these results highlight engGNN as a robust, flexible, and interpretable framework for disease classification and biomarker discovery in high-dimensional omics contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 14 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose Assembly Flow Graph (AFG) to comprehensively represent the assembly flow of a binary executable as graph data. Importantly, AFG can be used to extract granular explanations needed to increase transparency for malware detection using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, since AFGs may be large in practice, we also propose a Meta-Coarsening approach to improve computational tractability via graph reduction. To evaluate our proposed approach we consider several novel and existing metrics to quantify the granularity and quality of explanations. Lastly, we also consider several hyperparameters in our proposed Meta-Coarsening approach that can be used to control the final explanation size. We evaluate our proposed approach using the CIC-DGG-2025 dataset. Our results indicate that our proposed AFG and Meta-Coarsening approach can provide both increased explainability and inference performance at certain coarsening levels. However, most importantly, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider granular explainability in malware detection using GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Riemannian Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02600v2)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph data often exhibits complex geometric heterogeneity, where structures with varying local curvature, such as tree-like hierarchies and dense communities, coexist within a single network. Existing geometric GNNs, which embed graphs into single fixed-curvature manifolds or discrete product spaces, struggle to capture this diversity. We introduce Adaptive Riemannian Graph Neural Networks (ARGNN), a novel framework that learns a continuous and anisotropic Riemannian metric tensor field over the graph. It allows each node to determine its optimal local geometry, enabling the model to fluidly adapt to the graph's structural landscape. Our core innovation is an efficient parameterization of the node-wise metric tensor, specializing to a learnable diagonal form that captures directional geometric information while maintaining computational tractability. To ensure geometric regularity and stable training, we integrate a Ricci flow-inspired regularization that smooths the learned manifold. Theoretically, we establish the rigorous geometric evolution convergence guarantee for ARGNN and provide a continuous generalization that unifies prior fixed or mixed-curvature GNNs. Empirically, our method demonstrates superior performance on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmark datasets with the ability to capture diverse structures adaptively. Moreover, the learned geometries both offer interpretable insights into the underlying graph structure and empirically corroborate our theoretical analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in The Fortieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-26), Main Technical Track</p></details> |
| **[Riemannian Liquid Spatio-Temporal Graph Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14115v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Liquid Time-Constant networks (LTCs), a type of continuous-time graph neural network, excel at modeling irregularly-sampled dynamics but are fundamentally confined to Euclidean space. This limitation introduces significant geometric distortion when representing real-world graphs with inherent non-Euclidean structures (e.g., hierarchies and cycles), degrading representation quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Riemannian Liquid Spatio-Temporal Graph Network (RLSTG), a framework that unifies continuous-time liquid dynamics with the geometric inductive biases of Riemannian manifolds. RLSTG models graph evolution through an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) formulated directly on a curved manifold, enabling it to faithfully capture the intrinsic geometry of both structurally static and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for RLSTG, extending stability theorems of LTCs to the Riemannian domain and quantifying its expressive power via state trajectory analysis. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that, by combining advanced temporal dynamics with a Riemannian spatial representation, RLSTG achieves superior performance on graphs with complex structures.

| **[Focus on What Matters: Fisher-Guided Adaptive Multimodal Fusion for Vulnerability Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02438v2)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software vulnerability detection can be formulated as a binary classification problem that determines whether a given code snippet contains security defects. Existing multimodal methods typically fuse Natural Code Sequence (NCS) representations extracted by pretrained models with Code Property Graph (CPG) representations extracted by graph neural networks, under the implicit assumption that introducing an additional modality necessarily yields information gain. Through empirical analysis, we demonstrate the limitations of this assumption: pretrained models already encode substantial structural information implicitly, leading to strong overlap between the two modalities; moreover, graph encoders are generally less effective than pretrained language models in feature extraction. As a result, naive fusion not only struggles to obtain complementary signals but can also dilute effective discriminative cues due to noise propagation. To address these challenges, we propose a task-conditioned complementary fusion strategy that uses Fisher information to quantify task relevance, transforming cross-modal interaction from full-spectrum matching into selective fusion within a task-sensitive subspace. Our theoretical analysis shows that, under an isotropic perturbation assumption, this strategy significantly tightens the upper bound on the output error. Based on this insight, we design the TaCCS-DFA framework, which combines online low-rank Fisher subspace estimation with an adaptive gating mechanism to enable efficient task-oriented fusion. Experiments on the BigVul, Devign, and ReVeal benchmarks demonstrate that TaCCS-DFA delivers up to a 6.3-point gain in F1 score with only a 3.4% increase in inference latency, while maintaining low calibration error.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resilient Routing: Risk-Aware Dynamic Routing in Smart Logistics via Spatiotemporal Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13632v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of the e-commerce industry, the logistics network is experiencing unprecedented pressure. The traditional static routing strategy most time cannot tolerate the traffic congestion and fluctuating retail demand. In this paper, we propose a Risk-Aware Dynamic Routing(RADR) framework which integrates Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNN) with combinatorial optimization. We first construct a logistics topology graph by using the discrete GPS data using spatial clustering methods. Subsequently, a hybrid deep learning model combining Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is adopted to extract spatial correlations and temporal dependencies for predicting future congestion risks. These prediction results are then integrated into a dynamic edge weight mechanism to perform path planning. We evaluated the framework on the Smart Logistics Dataset 2024, which contains real-world Internet of Things(IoT) sensor data. The experimental results show that the RADR algorithm significantly enhances the resilience of the supply chain. Particularly in the case study of high congestion scenarios, our method reduces the potential congestion risk exposure by 19.3% while only increasing the transportation distance by 2.1%. This empirical evidence confirms that the proposed data-driven approach can effectively balance delivery efficiency and operational safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks are Heuristics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13465v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate that a single training trajectory can transform a graph neural network into an unsupervised heuristic for combinatorial optimization. Focusing on the Travelling Salesman Problem, we show that encoding global structural constraints as an inductive bias enables a non-autoregressive model to generate solutions via direct forward passes, without search, supervision, or sequential decision-making. At inference time, dropout and snapshot ensembling allow a single model to act as an implicit ensemble, reducing optimality gaps through increased solution diversity. Our results establish that graph neural networks do not require supervised training nor explicit search to be effective. Instead, they can internalize global combinatorial structure and function as strong, learned heuristics. This reframes the role of learning in combinatorial optimization: from augmenting classical algorithms to directly instantiating new heuristics.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrustEnergy: A Unified Framework for Accurate and Reliable User-level Energy Usage Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13422v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Energy usage prediction is important for various real-world applications, including grid management, infrastructure planning, and disaster response. Although a plethora of deep learning approaches have been proposed to perform this task, most of them either overlook the essential spatial correlations across households or fail to scale to individualized prediction, making them less effective for accurate fine-grained user-level prediction. In addition, due to the dynamic and uncertain nature of energy usage caused by various factors such as extreme weather events, quantifying uncertainty for reliable prediction is also significant, but it has not been fully explored in existing work. In this paper, we propose a unified framework called TrustEnergy for accurate and reliable user-level energy usage prediction. There are two key technical components in TrustEnergy, (i) a Hierarchical Spatiotemporal Representation module to efficiently capture both macro and micro energy usage patterns with a novel memory-augmented spatiotemporal graph neural network, and (ii) an innovative Sequential Conformalized Quantile Regression module to dynamically adjust uncertainty bounds to ensure valid prediction intervals over time, without making strong assumptions about the underlying data distribution. We implement and evaluate our TrustEnergy framework by working with an electricity provider in Florida, and the results show our TrustEnergy can achieve a 5.4% increase in prediction accuracy and 5.7% improvement in uncertainty quantification compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

In such networks, multiple AI agents optimize the network to achieve distinct and often competing objectives. As such, conflicts become inevitable and have the potential to degrade performance, cause instability, and disrupt service. Current approaches for conflict detection rely on conflict graphs created based on relationships between AI agents, parameters, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Existing works often rely on complex and computationally expensive Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and depend on manually chosen thresholds to create conflict graphs. In this work, we present the first systematic framework for conflict detection in AI-native mobile networks, propose a two-tower encoder architecture for learning interactions based on data from the RAN, and introduce a data-driven sparsity-based mechanism for autonomously reconstructing conflict graphs without manual fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

MDP states are represented as data bases of facts about entities, and Vejde converts each state to a bipartite graph, which is mapped to latent states through neural message passing. The factored representation of both states and actions allows Vejde agents to handle problems of varying size and structure. We tested Vejde agents on eight problem domains defined in RDDL, with ten problem instances each, where policies were trained using both supervised and reinforcement learning. To test policy generalization, we separate problem instances in two sets, one for training and the other solely for testing. Test results on unseen instances for the Vejde agents were compared to MLP agents trained on each problem instance, as well as the online planning algorithm Prost. Our results show that Vejde policies in average generalize to the test instances without a significant loss in score. Additionally, the inductive agents received scores on unseen test instances that on average were close to the instance-specific MLP agents.</p></details> |  |

However, it faces two major challenges: (1) demographic-based targeting creates segment-specific LTV distributions with large value variations across user groups; and (2) dynamic marketing strategies generate irregular behavioral sequences where engagement patterns evolve rapidly. We propose a Hyper-Temporal Graph Neural Network (HT-GNN), which jointly models demographic heterogeneity and temporal dynamics through three key components: (i) a hypergraph-supervised module capturing inter-segment relationships; (ii) a transformer-based temporal encoder with adaptive weighting; and (iii) a task-adaptive mixture-of-experts with dynamic prediction towers for multi-horizon LTV forecasting. Experiments on \textit{Baidu Ads} with 15 million users demonstrate that HT-GNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all metrics and prediction horizons.</p></details> |  |

The proposed Hierarchical Attribution Graph Decomposition (HAGD) framework reduces circuit discovery complexity from O(2^n) exhaustive enumeration to O(n^2 log n) through multi-resolution abstraction hierarchies and differentiable circuit search. The methodology integrates cross-layer transcoders for monosemantic feature extraction, graph neural network meta-learning for topology prediction, and causal intervention protocols for validation. Empirical evaluation spans GPT-2 variants, Llama-7B through Llama-70B, and Pythia suite models across algorithmic tasks and natural language benchmarks. On modular arithmetic tasks, the framework achieves up to 91% behavioral preservation ($\pm$2.3\% across runs) while maintaining interpretable subgraph sizes. Cross-architecture transfer experiments suggest that discovered circuits exhibit moderate structural similarity (averaging 67%) across model families, indicating potential shared computational patterns. These results provide preliminary foundations for interpretability at larger model scales while identifying significant limitations in current attribution methodologies that require future advances.</p></details> |  |

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) effectively capture local structural patterns, they struggle to internalize multi hop, logic driven motifs such as fund dispersal and layering that characterize sophisticated money laundering, limiting their forensic accountability under regulations like the FATF Travel Rule. To address this limitation, we propose Relational Domain Logic Integration (RDLI), a framework that embeds expert derived heuristics as differentiable, logic aware latent signals within representation learning. Unlike static rule based approaches, RDLI enables the detection of complex transactional flows that evade standard message passing. To further account for market volatility, we incorporate a Retrieval Grounded Context (RGC) module that conditions anomaly scoring on regulatory and macroeconomic context, mitigating false positives caused by benign regime shifts. Under extreme label scarcity (0.01%), RDLI outperforms state of the art GNN baselines by 28.9% in F1 score. A micro expert user study further confirms that RDLI path level explanations significantly improve trustworthiness, perceived usefulness, and clarity compared to existing methods, highlighting the importance of integrating domain logic with contextual grounding for both accuracy and explainability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Gyuye...</summary><p>Gyuyeon Na, Minjung Park, Soyoun Kim contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

The accurate representation of ocean dynamics across a wide range of spatial scales remains a major challenge in such applications. This study proposes a multi-scale graph neural network-based ocean model for 10-day global forecasting that improves short-term prediction skill and enhances the representation of multi-scale ocean variability. The model employs an encoder-processor-decoder architecture and uses two spherical meshes with different resolutions to better capture the multi-scale nature of ocean dynamics. In addition, the model incorporates surface atmospheric variables along with ocean state variables as node inputs to improve short-term prediction accuracy by representing atmospheric forcing. Evaluation using surface kinetic energy spectra and case studies shows that the model accurately represents a broad range of spatial scales, while root mean square error comparisons demonstrate improved skill in short-term predictions. These results indicate that the proposed model delivers more accurate short-term forecasts and improved representation of multi-scale ocean dynamics, thereby highlighting its potential to advance data-driven, eddy-resolving global ocean forecasting.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the notion of \textit{Subpopulation Boolean Isomorphism} (SBI) as an invariant that strictly subsumes existing expressivity measures such as Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL), biconnectivity-based, and homomorphism-based frameworks. Our theoretical results identify Fourier degree, circuit class (AC$^0$, NC$^1$), and influence as key barriers to expressivity in fairness-aware GNNs. We design a circuit-traversal-based fairness algorithm capable of handling subpopulations defined by high-complexity Boolean functions, such as parity, which break existing baselines. Experiments on real-world graphs show that our method achieves low fairness gaps across intersectional groups where state-of-the-art methods fail, providing the first principled treatment of GNN expressivity tailored to fairness.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Graph Prompt Fine-Tuning Method for WSN Spatio-Temporal Correlation Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12745v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection of multi-temporal modal data in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) can provide an important guarantee for reliable network operation. Existing anomaly detection methods in multi-temporal modal data scenarios have the problems of insufficient extraction of spatio-temporal correlation features, high cost of anomaly sample category annotation, and imbalance of anomaly samples. In this paper, a graph neural network anomaly detection backbone network incorporating spatio-temporal correlation features and a multi-task self-supervised training strategy of "pre-training - graph prompting - fine-tuning" are designed for the characteristics of WSN graph structure data. First, the anomaly detection backbone network is designed by improving the Mamba model based on a multi-scale strategy and inter-modal fusion method, and combining it with a variational graph convolution module, which is capable of fully extracting spatio-temporal correlation features in the multi-node, multi-temporal modal scenarios of WSNs. Secondly, we design a three-subtask learning "pre-training" method with no-negative comparative learning, prediction, and reconstruction to learn generic features of WSN data samples from unlabeled data, and design a "graph prompting-fine-tuning" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning. The model is fine-tuned through the "graph prompting-fine-tuning" mechanism to guide the pre-trained self-supervised learning model to complete the parameter fine-tuning, thereby reducing the training cost and enhancing the detection generalization performance. The F1 metrics obtained from experiments on the public dataset and the actual collected dataset are up to 91.30% and 92.31%, respectively, which provides better detection performance and generalization ability than existing methods designed by the method.</p></details> |  |

Each node caches samples from others and communicates over wireless collision channels, aiming to minimize time-average estimation error via decentralized policies. Due to the high dimensionality of action spaces and complexity of network topologies, deriving optimal policies analytically is intractable. To address this, we propose a graphical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for policy optimization. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our proposed policies are transferable, allowing a policy trained on one graph to be effectively applied to structurally similar graphs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that (i) our proposed policy outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; (ii) the trained policies are transferable to larger networks, with performance gains increasing with the number of agents; (iii) the graphical training procedure withstands non-stationarity, even when using independent learning techniques; and (iv) recurrence is pivotal in both independent learning and centralized training and decentralized execution, and improves the resilience to non-stationarity.</p></details> |  |

Human mobility plays a central role in shaping the spatial spread of epidemics, but mobility data are noisy, indirect, and difficult to integrate reliably with disease records. Meanwhile, epidemic case time series are typically short and reported at coarse temporal resolution. These conditions limit the effectiveness of parameter-heavy mobility-aware forecasters that rely on clean and abundant data. In this work, we propose the Mobility-Informed Causal Adapter (MiCA), a lightweight and architecture-agnostic module for epidemic forecasting. MiCA infers mobility relations through causal discovery and integrates them into temporal forecasting models via gated residual mixing. This design allows lightweight forecasters to selectively exploit mobility-derived spatial structure while remaining robust under noisy and data-limited conditions, without introducing heavy relational components such as graph neural networks or full attention. Extensive experiments on four real-world epidemic datasets, including COVID-19 incidence, COVID-19 mortality, influenza, and dengue, show that MiCA consistently improves lightweight temporal backbones, achieving an average relative error reduction of 7.5\% across forecasting horizons. Moreover, MiCA attains performance competitive with SOTA spatio-temporal models while remaining lightweight.</p></details> |  |

Yet most 3D molecular graph neural networks still rely on globally fixed neighborhood heuristics, typically defined by distance cutoffs and maximum neighbor limits, to define local message-passing neighborhoods, leading to rigid, data-agnostic interaction budgets. We propose Multiscale Interaction Mixture of Experts (MI-MoE) to adapt interaction modeling across geometric regimes. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce a distance-cutoff expert ensemble that explicitly captures short-, mid-, and long-range interactions without committing to a single cutoff; (2) we design a topological gating encoder that routes inputs to experts using filtration-based descriptors, including persistent homology features, summarizing how connectivity evolves across radii; and (3) we show that MI-MoE is a plug-in module that consistently improves multiple strong 3D molecular backbones across diverse molecular and polymer property prediction benchmark datasets, covering both regression and classification tasks. These results highlight topology-aware multiscale routing as an effective principle for 3D molecular graph learning.</p></details> |  |

Despite its importance, finding the most frequent induced subgraph remains computationally expensive due to the NP-hard nature of the subgraph counting task. Traditional exact enumeration algorithms often suffer from high time complexity, especially for a large graph size $k$. To mitigate this, existing approaches often utilize frequency measurement with the Downward Closure Property to reduce the search space, imposing additional constraints on the task. In this paper, we first formulate this task as a Markov Decision Process and approach it using a multi-task reinforcement learning framework. Specifically, we introduce RLMiner, a novel framework that integrates reinforcement learning with our proposed task-state-aware Graph Neural Network to find the most frequent induced subgraph of size $k$ with a time complexity linear to $k$. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed RLMiner effectively identifies subgraphs with frequencies closely matching the ground-truth most frequent induced subgraphs, while achieving significantly shorter and more stable running times compared to traditional methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[ATLAS: Adaptive Topology-based Learning at Scale for Homophilic and Heterophilic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14908v2)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present ATLAS (Adaptive Topology-based Learning at Scale for Homophilic and Heterophilic Graphs), a novel graph learning algorithm that addresses two important challenges in graph neural networks (GNNs). First, the accuracy of GNNs degrades when the graph is heterophilic. Second, iterative feature aggregation limits the scalability of GNNs to large graphs. We address these challenges by extracting topological information about graph communities at multiple levels of refinement, concatenating community assignments to the feature vector, and applying multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to the resulting representation. This provides topological context about nodes and their neighborhoods without invoking aggregation. Because MLPs are typically more scalable than GNNs, our approach applies to large graphs without the need for sampling. Across a wide set of graphs, ATLAS achieves comparable accuracy to baseline methods, with gains as high as 20 percentage points over GCN for heterophilic graphs with negative structural bias and 11 percentage points over MLP for homophilic graphs. Furthermore, we show how multi-resolution community features systematically modulate performance in both homophilic and heterophilic settings, opening a principled path toward explainable graph learning.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[RIPPLE++: An Incremental Framework for Efficient GNN Inference on Evolving Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12347v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world graphs are dynamic, with frequent updates to their structure and features due to evolving vertex and edge properties. These continual changes pose significant challenges for efficient inference in graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing vertex-wise and layer-wise inference approaches are ill-suited for dynamic graphs, as they incur redundant computations, large neighborhood traversals, and high communication costs, especially in distributed settings. Additionally, while sampling-based approaches can be adopted to approximate final layer embeddings, these are often not preferred in critical applications due to their non-determinism. These limitations hinder low-latency inference required in real-time applications. To address this, we propose RIPPLE++, a framework for streaming GNN inference that efficiently and accurately updates embeddings in response to changes in the graph structure or features. RIPPLE++ introduces a generalized incremental programming model that captures the semantics of GNN aggregation functions and incrementally propagates updates to affected neighborhoods. RIPPLE++ accommodates all common graph updates, including vertex/edge addition/deletions and vertex feature updates. RIPPLE++ supports both single-machine and distributed deployments. On a single machine, it achieves up to $56$K updates/sec on sparse graphs like Arxiv ($169$K vertices, $1.2$M edges), and about $7.6$K updates/sec on denser graphs like Products ($2.5$M vertices, $123.7$M edges), with latencies of $0.06$--$960$ms, and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by $2.2$--$24\times$ on throughput. In distributed settings, RIPPLE++ offers up to $\approx25\times$ higher throughput and $20\times$ lower communication costs compared to recomputing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended full-length version of paper that appeared at ICDCS 2025: "RIPPLE: Scalable Incremental GNN Inferencing on Large Streaming Graphs", Pranjal Naman and Yogesh Simmhan, in International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS), 2025.

| **[GNN2R: Weakly-Supervised Rationale-Providing Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02317v4)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), knowledge graph-based question answering (KGQA) remains essential for producing verifiable and hallucination-resistant answers in many real-world settings where answer trustworthiness and computational efficiency are highly valued. However, most existing KGQA methods provide only final answers in the form of KG entities. Without explicit explanations -- ideally in the form of intermediate reasoning process over relevant KG triples, the QA results are difficult to inspect and interpret. Moreover, this limitation prevents the rich and verifiable knowledge encoded in KGs, which is a key advantage of KGQA over LLMs, from being fully leveraged. However, addressing this issue remains highly challenging due to the lack of annotated intermediate reasoning process and the requirement of high efficiency in KGQA. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network-based Two-Step Reasoning method (GNN2R) that can efficiently retrieve both final answers and corresponding reasoning subgraphs as verifiable rationales, using only weak supervision from widely-available final answer annotations. We extensively evaluated GNN2R and demonstrated that GNN2R substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art KGQA methods in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and the quality of generated explanations. The complete code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/ruijie-wang-uzh/GNN2R.</p></details> |  |

As AD and FTD propagate along white-matter regions in a global, graph-dependent manner, graph-based neural networks are well suited to capture these patterns. Hence, we introduce ARMARecon, a unified graph learning framework that integrates Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) graph filtering with a reconstruction-driven objective to enhance feature representation and improve classification accuracy. ARMARecon effectively models both local and global connectivity by leveraging 20-bin Fractional Anisotropy (FA) histogram features extracted from white-matter regions, while mitigating over-smoothing. Overall, ARMARecon achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on the multi-site dMRI datasets ADNI and NIFD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2026</p></details> |
| **[Effective and Unsupervised Social Event Detection and Evolution via RAG and Structural Entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12035v1)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing scale of social media, social event detection and evolution modeling have attracted increasing attention. Graph neural networks (GNNs) and transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) have become mainstream approaches in this area. However, existing methods still face three major challenges. First, the sheer volume of social media messages makes learning resource-intensive. Second, the fragmentation of social media messages often impedes the model's ability to capture a comprehensive view of the events. Third, the lack of structured temporal context has hindered the development of effective models for event evolution, limiting users' access to event information. To address these challenges, we propose a foundation model for unsupervised Social Event Detection and Evolution, namely RagSEDE. Specifically, RagSEDE introduces a representativeness- and diversity-driven sampling strategy to extract key messages from massive social streams, significantly reducing noise and computational overhead. It further establishes a novel paradigm based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that enhances PLMs in detecting events while simultaneously constructing and maintaining an evolving event knowledge base. Finally, RagSEDE leverages structural information theory to dynamically model event evolution keywords for the first time. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of RagSEDE in open-world social event detection and evolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, accepted for The Web Conference (WWW) 2026</p></details> |
| **[Automating Traffic Monitoring with SHM Sensor Networks via Vision-Supervised Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19023v3)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bridges, as critical components of civil infrastructure, are increasingly affected by deterioration, making reliable traffic monitoring essential for assessing their remaining service life. Among operational loads, traffic load plays a pivotal role, and recent advances in deep learning - particularly in computer vision (CV) - have enabled progress toward continuous, automated monitoring. However, CV-based approaches suffer from limitations, including privacy concerns and sensitivity to lighting conditions, while traditional non-vision-based methods often lack flexibility in deployment and validation. To bridge this gap, we propose a fully automated deep-learning pipeline for continuous traffic monitoring using structural health monitoring (SHM) sensor networks. Our approach integrates CV-assisted high-resolution dataset generation with supervised training and inference, leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture the spatial structure and interdependence of sensor data. By transferring knowledge from CV outputs to SHM sensors, the proposed framework enables sensor networks to achieve comparable accuracy of vision-based systems, with minimal human intervention. Applied to accelerometer and strain gauge data in a real-world case study, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with classification accuracies of 99% for light vehicles and 94% for heavy vehicles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structural Graph Neural Networks with Anatomical Priors for Explainable Chest X-ray Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11987v1)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a structural graph reasoning framework that incorporates explicit anatomical priors for explainable vision-based diagnosis. Convolutional feature maps are reinterpreted as patch-level graphs, where nodes encode both appearance and spatial coordinates, and edges reflect local structural adjacency. Unlike conventional graph neural networks that rely on generic message passing, we introduce a custom structural propagation mechanism that explicitly models relative spatial relations as part of the reasoning process. This design enables the graph to act as an inductive bias for structured inference rather than a passive relational representation. The proposed model jointly supports node-level lesion-aware predictions and graph-level diagnostic reasoning, yielding intrinsic explainability through learned node importance scores without relying on post-hoc visualization techniques. We demonstrate the approach through a chest X-ray case study, illustrating how structural priors guide relational reasoning and improve interpretability. While evaluated in a medical imaging context, the framework is domain-agnostic and aligns with the broader vision of graph-based reasoning across artificial intelligence systems. This work contributes to the growing body of research exploring graphs as computational substrates for structure-aware and explainable learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

With a lack of sufficient specialized treatment resources, such as inpatient beds or staff, there is an unmet need to develop an automated framework for the same. Current decision-making approaches suffer from severe class imbalances in addiction datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a novel graph neural network (GRACE) framework that formalizes locus of care prediction as a structured learning problem. In addition, we propose a new approach of obtaining an unbiased meta-graph to train a GNN to overcome the class imbalance problem. Experimental results with real-world data show an improvement of 11-35% in terms of the F1 score of the minority class over competitive baselines. Further, if we jointly finetune the base embedding fed into GRACE as input together with the rest of the GNN component of GRACE, there is a remarkable boost of 15.8% in performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Method for Detecting Spatio-temporal Correlation Anomalies of WSN Nodes Based on Topological Information Enhancement and Time-frequency Feature Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11951v1)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing anomaly detection methods for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) generally suffer from insufficient ex-traction of spatio-temporal correlation features, reliance on either time-domain or frequency-domain information alone, and high computational overhead. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a topology-enhanced spatio-temporal feature fusion anomaly detection method, TE-MSTAD. First, building upon the RWKV model with linear attention mechanisms, a Cross-modal Feature Extraction (CFE) module is introduced to fully extract spatial correlation features among multiple nodes while reducing computational resource consumption. Second, a strategy is designed to construct an adjacency matrix by jointly learning spatial correlation from time-frequency domain features. Different graph neural networks are integrated to enhance spatial correlation feature extraction, thereby fully capturing spatial relationships among multiple nodes. Finally, a dual-branch network TE-MSTAD is designed for time-frequency domain feature fusion, overcoming the limitations of relying solely on the time or frequency domain to improve WSN anomaly detection performance. Testing on both public and real-world datasets demonstrates that the TE-MSTAD model achieves F1 scores of 92.52% and 93.28%, respectively, exhibiting superior detection performance and generalization capabilities compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

We integrate EAGLE-I outage records from 2014 to 2024 with weather, socioeconomic, infrastructure, and seasonal event data. Incorporating social and demographic indicators reveals patterns of community vulnerability and improves understanding of outage risk during extreme conditions. Four machine learning models are evaluated including Random Forest (RF), Graph Neural Network (GNN), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM).

| **[GenDA: Generative Data Assimilation on Complex Urban Areas via Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11440v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban wind flow reconstruction is essential for assessing air quality, heat dispersion, and pedestrian comfort, yet remains challenging when only sparse sensor data are available. We propose GenDA, a generative data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-resolution wind fields on unstructured meshes from limited observations. The model employs a multiscale graph-based diffusion architecture trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and interprets classifier-free guidance as a learned posterior reconstruction mechanism: the unconditional branch learns a geometry-aware flow prior, while the sensor-conditioned branch injects observational constraints during sampling. This formulation enables obstacle-aware reconstruction and generalization across unseen geometries, wind directions, and mesh resolutions without retraining. We consider both sparse fixed sensors and trajectory-based observations using the same reconstruction procedure. When evaluated against supervised graph neural network (GNN) baselines and classical reduced-order data assimilation methods, GenDA reduces the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) by 25-57% and increases the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 23-33% across the tested meshes. Experiments are conducted on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of a real urban neighbourhood in Bristol, United Kingdom, at a characteristic Reynolds number of $\mathrm{Re}\approx2\times10^{7}$, featuring complex building geometry and irregular terrain. The proposed framework provides a scalable path toward generative, geometry-aware data assimilation for environmental monitoring in complex domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[New Adaptive Mechanism for Large Neighborhood Search using Dual Actor-Critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11414v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) is a widely used heuristic method for solving combinatorial optimization problems. ALNS explores the solution space by iteratively using destroy and repair operators with probabilities, which are adjusted by an adaptive mechanism to find optimal solutions. However, the classic ALNS adaptive mechanism does not consider the interaction between destroy and repair operators when selecting them. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a novel adaptive mechanism. This mechanism enhances the adaptability of the algorithm through a Dual Actor-Critic (DAC) model, which fully considers the fact that the quality of new solutions is jointly determined by the destroy and repair operators. It effectively utilizes the interaction between these operators during the weight adjustment process, greatly improving the adaptability of the ALNS algorithm. In this mechanism, the destroy and repair processes are modeled as independent Markov Decision Processes to guide the selection of operators more accurately. Furthermore, we use Graph Neural Networks to extract key features from problem instances and perform effective aggregation and normalization to enhance the algorithm's transferability to different sizes and characteristics of problems. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed DAC-ALNS algorithm significantly improves solution efficiency and exhibits excellent transferability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Factored Value Functions for Graph-Based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11401v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Credit assignment is a core challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), especially in large-scale systems with structured, local interactions. Graph-based Markov decision processes (GMDPs) capture such settings via an influence graph, but standard critics are poorly aligned with this structure: global value functions provide weak per-agent learning signals, while existing local constructions can be difficult to estimate and ill-behaved in infinite-horizon settings. We introduce the Diffusion Value Function (DVF), a factored value function for GMDPs that assigns to each agent a value component by diffusing rewards over the influence graph with temporal discounting and spatial attenuation. We show that DVF is well-defined, admits a Bellman fixed point, and decomposes the global discounted value via an averaging property. DVF can be used as a drop-in critic in standard RL algorithms and estimated scalably with graph neural networks. Building on DVF, we propose Diffusion A2C (DA2C) and a sparse message-passing actor, Learned DropEdge GNN (LD-GNN), for learning decentralised algorithms under communication costs. Across the firefighting benchmark and three distributed computation tasks (vector graph colouring and two transmit power optimisation problems), DA2C consistently outperforms local and global critic baselines, improving average reward by up to 11%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Dynamics Graph Convolutional Networks for model order reduction of parameterized time-dependent PDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11259v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are emerging as powerful tools for nonlinear Model Order Reduction (MOR) of time-dependent parameterized Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, existing methodologies struggle to combine geometric inductive biases with interpretable latent behavior, overlooking dynamics-driven features or disregarding spatial information. In this work, we address this gap by introducing Latent Dynamics Graph Convolutional Network (LD-GCN), a purely data-driven, encoder-free architecture that learns a global, low-dimensional representation of dynamical systems conditioned on external inputs and parameters. The temporal evolution is modeled in the latent space and advanced through time-stepping, allowing for time-extrapolation, and the trajectories are consistently decoded onto geometrically parameterized domains using a GNN. Our framework enhances interpretability by enabling the analysis of the reduced dynamics and supporting zero-shot prediction through latent interpolation. The methodology is mathematically validated via a universal approximation theorem for encoder-free architectures, and numerically tested on complex computational mechanics problems involving physical and geometric parameters, including the detection of bifurcating phenomena for Navier-Stokes equations.

| **[Theoretically and Practically Efficient Resistance Distance Computation on Large Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11159v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The computation of resistance distance is pivotal in a wide range of graph analysis applications, including graph clustering, link prediction, and graph neural networks. Despite its foundational importance, efficient algorithms for computing resistance distances on large graphs are still lacking. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including power iteration-based algorithms and random walk-based local approaches, often struggle with slow convergence rates, particularly when the condition number of the graph Laplacian matrix, denoted by $κ$, is large. To tackle this challenge, we propose two novel and efficient algorithms inspired by the classic Lanczos method: Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push, both designed to reduce dependence on $κ$. Among them, Lanczos Iteration is a near-linear time global algorithm, whereas Lanczos Push is a local algorithm with a time complexity independent of the size of the graph. More specifically, we prove that the time complexity of Lanczos Iteration is $\tilde{O}(\sqrtκ m)$ ($m$ is the number of edges of the graph and $\tilde{O}$ means the complexity omitting the $\log$ terms) which achieves a speedup of $\sqrtκ$ compared to previous power iteration-based global methods. For Lanczos Push, we demonstrate that its time complexity is $\tilde{O}(κ^{2.75})$ under certain mild and frequently established assumptions, which represents a significant improvement of $κ^{0.25}$ over the SOTA random walk-based local algorithms. We validate our algorithms through extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets of varying sizes and statistical properties, demonstrating that Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push significantly outperform SOTA methods in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Such threats have become a significant web harm that erodes societal fairness and affects the well being of online communities. However, existing detection methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs) struggle with two persistent challenges: (1) fraud camouflage, where malicious transactions mimic benign behaviors to evade detection, and (2) long-tailed data distributions, which obscure rare but critical fraudulent cases. To fill these gaps, we propose HIMVH, a Hippocampus-Inspired Multi-View Hypergraph learning model for web finance fraud detection. Specifically, drawing inspiration from the scene conflict monitoring role of the hippocampus, we design a cross-view inconsistency perception module that captures subtle discrepancies and behavioral heterogeneity across multiple transaction views. This module enables the model to identify subtle cross-view conflicts for detecting online camouflaged fraudulent behaviors. Furthermore, inspired by the match-mismatch novelty detection mechanism of the CA1 region, we introduce a novelty-aware hypergraph learning module that measures feature deviations from neighborhood expectations and adaptively reweights messages, thereby enhancing sensitivity to online rare fraud patterns in the long-tailed settings. Extensive experiments on six web-based financial fraud datasets demonstrate that HIMVH achieves 6.42\% improvement in AUC, 9.74\% in F1 and 39.14\% in AP on average over 15 SOTA models.</p></details> |  |

We consider a MACC system consisting of a single server, multiple cache nodes, and multiple user nodes. Each user can access an arbitrary subset of cache nodes to retrieve cached content. The objective is to design a general and low-complexity delivery scheme under fixed cache placement for arbitrary access topologies. We propose a universal graph-based framework for modeling the MACC delivery problem, where decoding conflicts among requested packets are captured by a conflict graph and the delivery design is reduced to a graph coloring problem. In this formulation, a lower transmission load corresponds to using fewer colors. The classical greedy coloring algorithm DSatur achieves a transmission load close to the index-coding converse bound, providing a tight benchmark, but its computational complexity becomes prohibitive for large-scale graphs. To overcome this limitation, we develop a learning-based framework using graph neural networks that efficiently constructs near-optimal coded multicast transmissions and generalizes across diverse access topologies and varying numbers of users. In addition, we extend the index-coding converse bound for uncoded cache placement to arbitrary access topologies and propose a low-complexity greedy approximation. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed learning-based scheme achieves transmission loads close to those of DSatur and the converse bound while significantly reducing computational time.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce Graph Linear Transformations, a linear transformation that realizes direct and indirect feature mixing on graphs through a single, well-defined linear operator derived from the graph structure. By interpreting graphs as walk-summable Gaussian graphical models, we compute these transformations via Gaussian Belief Propagation, enabling each node to aggregate information from both direct and indirect neighbors without explicit enumeration of multi-hop paths. We show that different constructions of the underlying precision matrix induce distinct and interpretable propagation biases, ranging from selective edge-level interactions to uniform structural smoothing, and that Graph Linear Transformations can achieve competitive or superior performance compared to both local message-passing GNNs and dynamic neighborhood aggregation models across homophilic and heterophilic benchmark datasets.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 Figures |

We study superposition, the sharing of directions by multiple features, directly in the latent space of GNNs. Using controlled experiments with unambiguous graph concepts, we extract features as (i) class-conditional centroids at the graph level and (ii) linear-probe directions at the node level, and then analyze their geometry with simple basis-invariant diagnostics. Across GCN/GIN/GAT we find: increasing width produces a phase pattern in overlap; topology imprints overlap onto node-level features that pooling partially remixes into task-aligned graph axes; sharper pooling increases axis alignment and reduces channel sharing; and shallow models can settle into metastable low-rank embeddings. These results connect representational geometry with concrete design choices (width, pooling, and final-layer activations) and suggest practical approaches for more interpretable GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge Homophily in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23773v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets, thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in reasoning-intensive question answering.</p></details> |  |
| **[PLGC: Pseudo-Labeled Graph Condensation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10358v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large graph datasets make training graph neural networks (GNNs) computationally costly. Graph condensation methods address this by generating small synthetic graphs that approximate the original data. However, existing approaches rely on clean, supervised labels, which limits their reliability when labels are scarce, noisy, or inconsistent. We propose Pseudo-Labeled Graph Condensation (PLGC), a self-supervised framework that constructs latent pseudo-labels from node embeddings and optimizes condensed graphs to match the original graph's structural and feature statistics -- without requiring ground-truth labels. PLGC offers three key contributions: (1) A diagnosis of why supervised condensation fails under label noise and distribution shift. (2) A label-free condensation method that jointly learns latent prototypes and node assignments. (3) Theoretical guarantees showing that pseudo-labels preserve latent structural statistics of the original graph and ensure accurate embedding alignment. Empirically, across node classification and link prediction tasks, PLGC achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art supervised condensation methods on clean datasets and exhibits substantial robustness under label noise, often outperforming all baselines by a significant margin. Our findings highlight the practical and theoretical advantages of self-supervised graph condensation in noisy or weakly-labeled environments.</p></details> |  |

Current GNN-based PRL methods typically rely on single-perspective graph construction strategies, which capture partial properties of residue interactions, resulting in incomplete protein representations. To address this limitation, we propose MMPG, a framework that constructs protein graphs from multiple perspectives and adaptively fuses them via Mixture of Experts (MoE) for PRL. MMPG constructs graphs from physical, chemical, and geometric perspectives to characterize different properties of residue interactions. To capture both perspective-specific features and their synergies, we develop an MoE module, which dynamically routes perspectives to specialized experts, where experts learn intrinsic features and cross-perspective interactions. We quantitatively verify that MoE automatically specializes experts in modeling distinct levels of interaction from individual representations, to pairwise inter-perspective synergies, and ultimately to a global consensus across all perspectives. Through integrating this multi-level information, MMPG produces superior protein representations and achieves advanced performance on four different downstream protein tasks.</p></details> |  |

In order to further improve the accuracy of the solution, we apply the attention mechanism in and between clusters of the join-graphs, which makes Attn-JGNN pay more attention to the key variables and clusters in probabilistic inference, and reduces the redundant calculation. Finally, our experiments show that our Attn-JGNN model achieves better results than other neural network methods.</p></details> |  |

To assess whether agents can navigate efficiently within such unprecedented topologies, we develop a hybrid simulation framework that integrates agent-based modeling, reinforcement learning (RL), supervised learning, and graph neural networks (GNNs). The simulation captures multi-modal transportation behaviors across multiple vertical levels and varying density scenarios, using both synthetic data and real-world traces from high-density cities. Experiments show that the full AI-integrated architecture enables agents to achieve an average commute time of 7.8--8.4 minutes, a satisfaction rate exceeding 89\%, and a reachability index over 91\%, even during peak congestion periods. Ablation studies indicate that removing intelligent modules such as RL or GNN significantly degrades performance, with commute times increasing by up to 85\% and reachability falling below 70\%. Environmental modeling demonstrates low energy consumption and minimal CO$_2$ emissions when electric modes are prioritized. These results suggest that efficient and sustainable mobility in extreme urban forms is achievable, provided adaptive AI systems, intelligent infrastructure, and real-time feedback mechanisms are implemented.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Network Surrogates to leverage Mechanistic Expert Knowledge towards Reliable and Immediate Pandemic Response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06500v4)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>During the COVID-19 crisis, mechanistic models have guided evidence-based decision making. However, time-critical decisions in a dynamical environment limit the time available to gather supporting evidence. We address this bottleneck by developing a graph neural network (GNN) surrogate of an age-structured and spatially resolved mechanistic metapopulation simulation model. This combined approach complements classical modeling approaches which are mostly mechanistic and purely data-driven machine learning approaches which are often black box. Our design of experiments spans outbreak and persistent-threat regimes, up to three contact change points, and age-structured contact matrices on a spatial graph with 400 nodes representing German counties. We benchmark multiple GNN layers and identify an ARMAConv-based architecture that offers a strong accuracy-runtime trade-off. Across horizons of 30-90 day simulation and prediction, allowing up to three contact change points, the surrogate model attains 10-27 \% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) while delivering (near) constant runtime with respect to the forecast horizon. Our approach accelerates evaluation by up to 28,670 times compared with the mechanistic model, allowing responsive decision support in time-critical scenarios and straightforward web integration. These results show how GNN surrogates can translate complex metapopulation models into immediate, reliable tools for pandemic response.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |
| **[SGAC: A Graph Neural Network Framework for Imbalanced and Structure-Aware AMP Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16276v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifying Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs) from the vast collection of peptides derived from metagenomic sequencing offers a promising avenue for combating antibiotic resistance. However, most existing AMP classification methods rely primarily on sequence-based representations and fail to capture the spatial structural information critical for accurate identification. Although recent graph-based approaches attempt to incorporate structural information, they typically construct residue- or atom-level graphs that introduce redundant atomic details and increase structural complexity. Furthermore, the class imbalance between the small number of known AMPs and the abundant non-AMPs significantly hinders predictive performance. To address these challenges, we employ lightweight OmegaFold to predict the three-dimensional structures of peptides and construct peptide graphs using C α atoms to capture their backbone geometry and spatial topology. Building on this representation, we propose the Spatial GNN-based AMP Classifier (SGAC), a novel framework that leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to extract structural features and generate discriminative graph representations. To handle class imbalance, SGAC incorporates Weight-enhanced Contrastive Learning to cluster structurally similar peptides and separate dissimilar ones through adaptive weighting, and applies Weight-enhanced Pseudo-label Distillation to generate high-confidence pseudo labels for unlabeled samples, achieving balanced and consistent representation learning. Experiments on publicly available AMP and non-AMP datasets demonstrate that SGAC significantly achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPOT-Face: Forensic Face Identification using Attention Guided Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09229v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person identification in forensic investigations becomes very challenging when common identification means for DNA (i.e., hair strands, soft tissue) are not available. Current methods utilize deep learning methods for face recognition. However, these methods lack effective mechanisms to model cross-domain structural correspondence between two different forensic modalities. In this paper, we introduce a SPOT-Face, a superpixel graph-based framework designed for cross-domain forensic face identification of victims using their skeleton and sketch images. Our unified framework involves constructing a superpixel-based graph from an image and then using different graph neural networks(GNNs) backbones to extract the embeddings of these graphs, while cross-domain correspondence is established through attention-guided optimal transport mechanism. We have evaluated our proposed framework on two publicly available dataset: IIT\_Mandi\_S2F (S2F) and CUFS. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate our proposed framework. The experimental results show significant improvement in identification metrics ( i.e., Recall, mAP) over existing graph-based baselines. Furthermore, our framework demonstrates to be highly effective for matching skulls and sketches to faces in forensic investigations.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables (ICPR_2026)</p></details> |

To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce GPA(graph neural network (GNN)-based Path-Aware multi-view circuit learning), a novel GNN framework that learns precise, data-driven delay predictions by synergistically fusing three complementary views of circuit structure: And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs)-based functional encoding, post-mapping technology emphasizes critical timing paths. Trained exclusively on real cell delays extracted from critical paths of industrial-grade post-mapping netlists, GPA learns to classify cut delays with unprecedented accuracy, directly informing smarter mapping decisions. Evaluated on the 19 EPFL combinational benchmarks, GPA achieves 19.9%, 2.1% and 4.1% average delay reduction over the conventional heuristics methods (techmap, MCH) and the prior state-of-the-art ML-based approach SLAP, respectively-without compromising area efficiency.</p></details> | 7pages, 4figures |

We introduce a unified benchmarking framework that decouples PEs from architectural choices, enabling a fair comparison across 8 GNN and Transformer models, 9 PEs, and 10 synthetic and real-world datasets. Across more than 500 model-PE-dataset configurations, we find that commonly used expressiveness proxies, including Weisfeiler-Lehman distinguishability, do not reliably predict downstream performance. In particular, highly expressive PEs frequently fail to improve, and can even degrade performance on real-world tasks. At the same time, we identify several simple and previously overlooked model-PE combinations that match or outperform recent state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate the strong task-dependence of PEs and underscore the need for empirical validation beyond theoretical expressiveness. To support reproducible research, we release an open-source benchmarking framework for evaluating PEs for graph learning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at KDD 2026 Datasets & Benchmarks Track</p></details> |
| **[A Mesh-Adaptive Hypergraph Neural Network for Unsteady Flow Around Oscillating and Rotating Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22252v2)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks, recently introduced into the field of fluid flow surrogate modeling, have been successfully applied to model the temporal evolution of various fluid flow systems. Existing applications, however, are mostly restricted to cases where the domain is time-invariant. The present work extends the application of graph neural network-based modeling to fluid flow around structures rotating with respect to a certain axis. Specifically, we propose to apply a graph neural network-based surrogate model with part of the mesh/graph co-rotating with the structure and part of the mesh/graph static. A single layer of interface cells are constructed at the interface between the two parts and are allowed to distort and adapt, which helps in circumventing the difficulty of interpolating information encoded by the neural network at every graph neural network layer. Dedicated reconstruction and re-projection schemes are designed to counter the error caused by the distortion and connectivity change of the interface cells. The effectiveness of our proposed framework is examined on two test cases: (i) fluid flow around a 2D oscillating airfoil, and (ii) fluid flow past a 3D rotating cube. Our results show that the model achieves stable rollout predictions over hundreds or even a thousand time steps. We further demonstrate that one could enforce accurate, error-bounded prediction results by incorporating the measurements from sparse pressure sensors. In addition to the accurate flow field predictions, the lift and drag force predictions closely match with the computational fluid dynamics calculations, highlighting the potential of the framework for modeling fluid flow around rotating structures, and paving the path towards a graph neural network-based surrogate model for more complex scenarios like flow around marine propellers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using Subgraph GNNs for Node Classification:an Overlooked Potential Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06614v2)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous studies have demonstrated the strong performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in node classification. However, most existing GNNs adopt a node-centric perspective and rely on global message passing, leading to high computational and memory costs that hinder scalability. To mitigate these challenges, subgraph-based methods have been introduced, leveraging local subgraphs as approximations of full computational trees. While this approach improves efficiency, it often suffers from performance degradation due to the loss of global contextual information, limiting its effectiveness compared to global GNNs. To address this trade-off between scalability and classification accuracy, we reformulate the node classification task as a subgraph classification problem and propose SubGND (Subgraph GNN for NoDe). This framework introduces a differentiated zero-padding strategy and an Ego-Alter subgraph representation method to resolve label conflicts while incorporating an Adaptive Feature Scaling Mechanism to dynamically adjust feature contributions based on dataset-specific dependencies. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that SubGND achieves performance comparable to or surpassing global message-passing GNNs, particularly in heterophilic settings, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability as a promising solution for node classification.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Directed Homophily-Aware Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22362v3)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in various learning tasks on graph-structured data. Nevertheless, most GNNs struggle to generalize to heterophilic neighborhoods. Additionally, many GNNs ignore the directional nature of real-world graphs, resulting in suboptimal performance on directed graphs with asymmetric structures. In this work, we propose Directed Homophily-aware Graph Neural Network (DHGNN), a novel framework that addresses these limitations by incorporating homophily-aware and direction-sensitive components. DHGNN employs a resettable gating mechanism to adaptively modulate message contributions based on homophily levels and informativeness, and a structure-aware noise-tolerant fusion module to effectively integrate node representations from the original and reverse directions. Extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic directed graph datasets demonstrate that DHGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification and link prediction. In particular, DHGNN improves over the best baseline by up to 15.07\% in link prediction. Our analysis further shows that the gating mechanism captures directional homophily gaps and fluctuating homophily across layers, providing deeper insights into message-passing behavior on complex graph structures.</p></details> |  |

Diagnostic complexity arises from visual symptom overlap with conditions like age-related macular degeneration and hypertensive retinopathy, exacerbated by high misdiagnosis rates in underserved regions. This study introduces TIMM-ProRS, a novel deep learning framework integrating Vision Transformer (ViT), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Graph Neural Network (GNN) with multi-modal fusion. TIMM-ProRS uniquely leverages both retinal images and temporal biomarkers (HbA1c, retinal thickness) to capture multi-modal and temporal dynamics. Evaluated comprehensively across diverse datasets including APTOS 2019 (trained), Messidor-2, RFMiD, EyePACS, and Messidor-1 (validated), the model achieves 97.8\% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.96, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and outperforming existing methods like RSG-Net and DeepDR. This approach enables early, precise, and interpretable diagnosis, supporting scalable telemedical management and enhancing global eye health sustainability.</p></details> |  |
| **[GADPN: Graph Adaptive Denoising and Perturbation Networks via Singular Value Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08230v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel on graph-structured data, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality of the observed graph, which often contains noise, missing links, or structural properties misaligned with GNNs' underlying assumptions. To address this, graph structure learning aims to infer a more optimal topology. Existing methods, however, often incur high computational costs due to complex generative models and iterative joint optimization, limiting their practical utility. In this paper, we propose GADPN, a simple yet effective graph structure learning framework that adaptively refines graph topology via low-rank denoising and generalized structural perturbation. Our approach makes two key contributions: (1) we introduce Bayesian optimization to adaptively determine the optimal denoising strength, tailoring the process to each graph's homophily level; and (2) we extend the structural perturbation method to arbitrary graphs via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), overcoming its original limitation to symmetric structures. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GADPN achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly improving efficiency. It shows particularly strong gains on challenging disassortative graphs, validating its ability to robustly learn enhanced graph structures across diverse network types.</p></details> |  |

However, GNNs rely on two key operations - aggregation and update, which can pose challenges for low-latency inference tasks or resource-constrained scenarios. Simple Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) offer a computationally efficient alternative. Yet, training an MLP in a supervised setting often leads to suboptimal performance. Knowledge Distillation (KD) from a GNN teacher to an MLP student has emerged to bridge this gap. However, most KD methods either transfer knowledge uniformly across all nodes or rely on graph-agnostic indicators such as prediction uncertainty. We argue this overlooks a more fundamental, graph-centric inquiry: "How important is a node to the structure of the graph?" We introduce a framework, InfGraND, an Influence-guided Graph KNowledge Distillation from GNN to MLP that addresses this by identifying and prioritizing structurally influential nodes to guide the distillation process, ensuring that the MLP learns from the most critical parts of the graph. Additionally, InfGraND embeds structural awareness in MLPs through one-time multi-hop neighborhood feature pre-computation, which enriches the student MLP's input and thus avoids inference-time overhead. Our rigorous evaluation in transductive and inductive settings across seven homophilic graph benchmark datasets shows InfGraND consistently outperforms prior GNN to MLP KD methods, demonstrating its practicality for numerous latency-critical applications in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR), 2026</p></details> |
| **[Geometry-Aware Edge Pooling for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11700v3)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown significant success for graph-based tasks. Motivated by the prevalence of large datasets in real-world applications, pooling layers are crucial components of GNNs. By reducing the size of input graphs, pooling enables faster training and potentially better generalisation. However, existing pooling operations often optimise for the learning task at the expense of discarding fundamental graph structures, thus reducing interpretability. This leads to unreliable performance across dataset types, downstream tasks and pooling ratios. Addressing these concerns, we propose novel graph pooling layers for structure-aware pooling via edge collapses. Our methods leverage diffusion geometry and iteratively reduce a graph's size while preserving both its metric structure and its structural diversity. We guide pooling using magnitude, an isometry-invariant diversity measure, which permits us to control the fidelity of the pooling process. Further, we use the spread of a metric space as a faster and more stable alternative ensuring computational efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our methods (i) achieve top performance compared to alternative pooling layers across a range of diverse graph classification tasks, (ii) preserve key spectral properties of the input graphs, and (iii) retain high accuracy across varying pooling ratios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2025.

However, many Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) approaches for this prediction are constrained by their choice of molecular representation: handcrafted descriptors capture global properties but miss local topology, graph neural networks encode structure but often lack broader chemical context, and SMILES-based language models provide contextual patterns learned from large corpora but are seldom combined with structural features. To exploit these complementary signals, we introduce Rep3Net, a unified multimodal architecture that fuses RDKit molecular descriptors, graph-derived features from a residual graph-convolutional backbone, and ChemBERTa SMILES embeddings. We evaluate Rep3Net on a curated ChEMBL subset for Human PARP1 using fivefold cross validation. Rep3Net attains an MSE of $0.83\pm0.06$, RMSE of $0.91\pm0.03$, $R^{2}=0.43\pm0.01$, and yields Pearson and Spearman correlations of $0.66\pm0.01$ and $0.67\pm0.01$, respectively, substantially improving over several strong GNN baselines. In addition, Rep3Net achieves a favorable latency-to-parameter trade-off thanks to a single-layer GCN backbone and parallel frozen encoders. Ablations show that graph topology, ChemBERTa semantics, and handcrafted descriptors each contribute complementary information, with full fusion providing the largest error reduction. These results demonstrate that multimodal representation fusion can improve potency prediction for PARP1 and provide a scalable framework for virtual screening in early-stage drug discovery.</p></details> |  |

Extracting features from data and making inferences based on them with neural network models often yields high accuracy; however, this approach has several drawbacks. Symbolic regression is a powerful technique for discovering analytical equations that describe data, providing interpretable and generalizable models capable of predicting unseen data. Symbolic regression methods have gained new momentum with the advancement of neural network technologies and offer several advantages, the main one being the interpretability of results. In this work, we examined the application of the deep symbolic regression algorithm SEGVAE to determine the properties of two-dimensional materials with defects. Comparing the results with state-of-the-art graph neural network-based methods shows comparable or, in some cases, even identical outcomes. We also discuss the applicability of this class of methods in natural sciences.</p></details> |  |

We challenge this prevailing focus in GNN research, arguing that these phenomena are less critical for practical applications than assumed. We suggest that performance decreases often stem from uninformative receptive fields rather than over-smoothing. We support this position with extensive experiments on several standard benchmark datasets, demonstrating that accuracy and over-smoothing are mostly uncorrelated and that optimal model depths remain small even with mitigation techniques, thus highlighting the negligible role of over-smoothing. Similarly, we challenge that over-squashing is always detrimental in practical applications. Instead, we posit that the distribution of relevant information over the graph frequently factorises and is often localised within a small k-hop neighbourhood, questioning the necessity of jointly observing entire receptive fields or engaging in an extensive search for long-range interactions. The results of our experiments show that architectural interventions designed to mitigate over-squashing fail to yield significant performance gains. This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in theoretical research, urging a diligent analysis of learning tasks and datasets using statistics that measure the underlying distribution of label-relevant information to better understand their localisation and factorisation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Scoring functions, as one of the tools guiding virtual screening, have their precision closely tied to screening efficiency. In our previous study, we developed a graph neural network model called PLANET (Protein-Ligand Affinity prediction NETwork), but it suffers from the defect in representing protein-ligand contact maps. Incorrect binding modes inevitably lead to poor affinity predictions, so accurate prediction of the protein-ligand contact map is desired to improve PLANET. In this study, we have proposed PLANET v2.0 as an upgraded version. The model is trained via multi-objective training strategy and incorporates the Mixture Density Network to predict binding modes. Except for the probability density distributions of non-covalent interactions, we innovatively employ another Gaussian mixture model to describe the relationship between distance and energy of each interaction pair and predict protein-ligand affinity like calculating the mathematical expectation. As on the CASF-2016 benchmark, PLANET v2.0 demonstrates excellent scoring power, ranking power, and docking power. The screening power of PLANET v2.0 gets notably improved compared to PLANET and Glide SP and it demonstrates robust validation on a commercial ultra-large-scale dataset. Given its efficiency and accuracy, PLANET v2.0 can hopefully become one of the practical tools for virtual screening workflows.

On the PubMed citation network dataset, we observe significant classification difficulty disparities, with Category 2 achieving only 74.4% accuracy in traditional GCN, 7.5% lower than Category 1. To address this, we propose a Wasserstein-Rubinstein (WR) distance enhanced Expert Fusion Model (WR-EFM), training specialized GNN models for Categories 0/1 (with layer normalization and residual connections) and Multi-hop Graph Attention Networks (GAT) for Category 2. The WR distance metric optimizes representation similarity between models, particularly focusing on improving Category 2 performance. Our adaptive fusion strategy dynamically weights models based on category-specific performance, with Category 2 assigned a GAT weight of 0.8. WR distance further guides the fusion process by measuring distributional differences between model representations, enabling more principled integration of complementary features. Experimental results show WR-EFM achieves balanced accuracy across categories: 77.8% (Category 0), 78.0% (Category 1), and 79.9% (Category 2), outperforming both single models and standard fusion approaches. The coefficient of variation (CV) of WR-EFM's category accuracies is 0.013, 77.6% lower than GCN's 0.058, demonstrating superior stability. Notably, WR-EFM improves Category 2 accuracy by 5.5% compared to GCN, verifying the effectiveness of WR-guided fusion in capturing complex structural patterns. This work provides a novel paradigm for handling class-imbalanced graph classification tasks. To promote the research community, we release our project at https://github.com/s010m00n/GASEM4NC.</p></details> | <details><summary>It's ...</summary><p>It's written so poorly, my bad</p></details> |

We study reliability through the lens of multi-model consensus: given responses from several heterogeneous LLMs, can we learn which answer is most likely correct for a given query? We introduce a Multi-Model Consensus Reasoning Engine that treats the set of LLM outputs as input to a supervised meta-learner. The system maps natural language responses into structured features using semantic embeddings, pairwise similarity and clustering statistics, lexical and structural cues, reasoning-quality scores, confidence estimates, and model-specific priors, and then applies gradient-boosted trees, listwise ranking, and graph neural networks over similarity graphs of answers. Using three open-weight LLMs evaluated on compact, resource-constrained subsets of GSM8K, ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, and TruthfulQA, our best graph-attention-based consensus model improves macro-average accuracy by 4.6 percentage points over the strongest single LLM and by 8.1 points over majority vote, while also yielding lower Brier scores and fewer TruthfulQA hallucinations. Ablation and feature-importance analyses show that semantic agreement and clustering features are most influential, with reasoning-quality and model-prior features providing complementary gains, suggesting supervised multi-model consensus is a practical route toward more reliable LLM behavior, even in a modest single-machine setup.</p></details> |  |

This work analyzes conspiratorial narratives in Singapore-based Telegram groups, showing that such content is woven into everyday discussions rather than confined to isolated echo chambers. We propose a two-stage computational framework. First, we fine-tune RoBERTa-large to classify messages as conspiratorial or not, achieving an F1-score of 0.866 on 2,000 expert-labeled messages. Second, we build a signed belief graph in which nodes represent messages and edge signs reflect alignment in belief labels, weighted by textual similarity. We introduce a Signed Belief Graph Neural Network (SiBeGNN) that uses a Sign Disentanglement Loss to learn embeddings that separate ideological alignment from stylistic features. Using hierarchical clustering on these embeddings, we identify seven narrative archetypes across 553,648 messages: legal topics, medical concerns, media discussions, finance, contradictions in authority, group moderation, and general chat. SiBeGNN yields stronger clustering quality (cDBI = 8.38) than baseline methods (13.60 to 67.27), supported by 88 percent inter-rater agreement in expert evaluations. Our analysis shows that conspiratorial messages appear not only in clusters focused on skepticism or distrust, but also within routine discussions of finance, law, and everyday matters. These findings challenge common assumptions about online radicalization by demonstrating that conspiratorial discourse operates within ordinary social interaction. The proposed framework advances computational methods for belief-driven discourse analysis and offers applications for stance detection, political communication studies, and content moderation policy.</p></details> |  |

Recent methods, including those using graph neural networks (GNNs) to model frequency and temporal dependencies, show strong potential but need large amounts of labeled data, which limits their practical use. Label-efficient alternatives like graph-based non-contrastive learning offer a potential solution, as they can learn useful representations from unlabeled data without using negative samples. However, current graph non-contrastive approaches are built for single-view graph representations and cannot be directly used for audio, which has unique spectral and temporal structures. Bridging this gap requires dual-view graph modeling suited to audio signals. In this work, we introduce SIGNL (Spectral-temporal vIsion Graph Non-contrastive Learning), a label-efficient expert system for detecting audio deepfakes. SIGNL operates on the visual representation of audio, such as spectrograms or other time-frequency encodings, transforming them into spectral and temporal graphs for structured feature extraction. It then employs graph convolutional encoders to learn complementary frequency-time features, effectively capturing the unique characteristics of audio. These encoders are pre-trained using a non-contrastive self-supervised learning strategy on augmented graph pairs, enabling effective representation learning without labeled data. The resulting encoders are then fine-tuned on minimal labelled data for downstream deepfake detection. SIGNL achieves strong performance on multiple audio deepfake detection benchmarks, including 7.88% EER on ASVspoof 2021 DF and 3.95% EER on ASVspoof 5 using only 5% labeled data. It also generalizes well to unseen conditions, reaching 10.16% EER on the In-The-Wild dataset when trained on CFAD.</p></details> |  |
