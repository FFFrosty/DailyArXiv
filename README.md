| **[Foundation Models for Demand Forecasting via Dual-Strategy Ensembling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22053v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate demand forecasting is critical for supply chain optimization, yet remains difficult in practice due to hierarchical complexity, domain shifts, and evolving external factors. While recent foundation models offer strong potential for time series forecasting, they often suffer from architectural rigidity and limited robustness under distributional change. In this paper, we propose a unified ensemble framework that enhances the performance of foundation models for sales forecasting in real-world supply chains. Our method combines two complementary strategies: (1) Hierarchical Ensemble (HE), which partitions training and inference by semantic levels (e.g., store, category, department) to capture localized patterns; and (2) Architectural Ensemble (AE), which integrates predictions from diverse model backbones to mitigate bias and improve stability. We conduct extensive experiments on the M5 benchmark and three external sales datasets, covering both in-domain and zero-shot forecasting. Results show that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines, improves accuracy across hierarchical levels, and provides a simple yet effective mechanism for boosting generalization in complex forecasting environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[TESSERA: Temporal Embeddings of Surface Spectra for Earth Representation and Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20380v3)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satellite remote sensing from repeated observations and multiple sensors enables a wide range of downstream applications, including climate modeling, carbon accounting, and strategies for conservation and sustainable land use. However, satellite time series are voluminous, often corrupted by sensor noise, clouds, and atmospheric conditions, and unevenly spaced in time, making them challenging to use. We present TESSERA, an open, global, land-oriented remote sensing foundation model that uses self-supervised learning to generate `ready-to-use' embeddings at 10~m scale from pixel-level satellite time series data. TESSERA uses two parallel Transformer-based encoders to combine optical data from ten Sentinel-2 spectral bands at 10-60~m spatial resolution and two Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar backscatter coefficients at 10~m resolution to create embeddings that are subsequently fused with a multilayer perceptron to create annual global embedding maps. We compare our work with state-of-the-art task-specific models and other foundation models in five diverse downstream tasks and find that TESSERA closely matches or outperforms these baselines. We believe that TESSERA's ease of use, openness, computation-, label-, and data-efficiency, and high performance will prove transformative in a wide range of vegetation-oriented ecological and agricultural applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Review on Self-Supervised Learning for Time Series Anomaly Detection: Recent Advances and Open Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15196v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection presents various challenges due to the sequential and dynamic nature of time-dependent data. Traditional unsupervised methods frequently encounter difficulties in generalization, often overfitting to known normal patterns observed during training and struggling to adapt to unseen normality. In response to this limitation, self-supervised techniques for time series have garnered attention as a potential solution to undertake this obstacle and enhance the performance of anomaly detectors. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the recent methods that make use of self-supervised learning for time series anomaly detection. A taxonomy is proposed to categorize these methods based on their primary characteristics, facilitating a clear understanding of their diversity within this field. The information contained in this survey, along with additional details that will be periodically updated, is available on the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/Aitorzan3/Awesome-Self-Supervised-Time-Series-Anomaly-Detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Capacity Expansion Modelling for Renewable Energy Systems under Weather Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06750v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future greenhouse gas neutral energy systems will be dominated by renewable energy technologies whose energy output is subject to uncertain weather conditions. This work proposes an algorithm to do capacity expansion planning (CAPEX) under weather uncertainty. When faced with multiple possible weather years, the quality of a CAPEX solution derived on a single year's data is evaluated across all years, and the CAPEX optimisation problem is iteratively modified whenever supply gaps are detected. These modifications lead to solutions with sufficient back--up capacity to overcome periods of (cold) dark lulls, and sufficient total annual energy supply across all years. A computational study on an energy system model of Germany shows that the iterative algorithm finds solutions that guarantee security of supply for all considered weather years for an increase of 1.6-2.9% in total annual cost compared to initial solutions. Results also underline the importance of assessing the feasibility of energy system models using atypical time--series, including dark lull and cold period effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Aware Probabilistic Modeling with LLM for Multimodal Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10774v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is important for applications spanning energy markets, climate analysis, and traffic management. However, existing methods struggle to effectively integrate exogenous texts and align them with the probabilistic nature of large language models (LLMs). Current approaches either employ shallow text-time series fusion via basic prompts or rely on deterministic numerical decoding that conflict with LLMs' token-generation paradigm, which limits contextual awareness and distribution modeling. To address these limitations, we propose CAPTime, a context-aware probabilistic multimodal time series forecasting method that leverages text-informed abstraction and autoregressive LLM decoding. Our method first encodes temporal patterns using a pretrained time series encoder, then aligns them with textual contexts via learnable interactions to produce joint multimodal representations. By combining a mixture of distribution experts with frozen LLMs, we enable context-aware probabilistic forecasting while preserving LLMs' inherent distribution modeling capabilities. Experiments on diverse time series forecasting tasks demonstrate the superior accuracy and generalization of CAPTime, particularly in multimodal scenarios. Additional analysis highlights its robustness in data-scarce scenarios through hybrid probabilistic decoding.</p></details> | 13 pages, 2 figures |
| **[EEG-CLIP : Learning EEG representations from natural language descriptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16531v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep networks for electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding are often only trained to solve one specific task, such as pathology or age decoding. A more general task-agnostic approach is to train deep networks to match a (clinical) EEG recording to its corresponding textual medical report and vice versa. This approach was pioneered in the computer vision domain matching images and their text captions and subsequently allowed to do successful zero-shot decoding using textual class prompts. In this work, we follow this approach and develop a contrastive learning framework, EEG-CLIP, that aligns the EEG time series and the descriptions of the corresponding clinical text in a shared embedding space. We investigated its potential for versatile EEG decoding, evaluating performance in a range of few-shot and zero-shot settings. Overall, we show that EEG-CLIP manages to non-trivially align text and EEG representations. Our work presents a promising approach to learn general EEG representations, which could enable easier analyses of diverse decoding questions through zero-shot decoding or training task-specific models from fewer training examples. The code for reproducing our results is available at https://github.com/tidiane-camaret/EEGClip</p></details> |  |
| **[DualSG: A Dual-Stream Explicit Semantic-Guided Multivariate Time Series Forecasting Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21830v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Forecasting plays a key role in many applications. Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively, methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs, rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation. Experiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value of explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ACM Multimedia 2025 (ACM MM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Motion Diffusion Autoencoders: Enabling Attribute Manipulation in Human Motion Demonstrated on Karate Techniques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18729v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attribute manipulation deals with the problem of changing individual attributes of a data point or a time series, while leaving all other aspects unaffected. This work focuses on the domain of human motion, more precisely karate movement patterns. To the best of our knowledge, it presents the first success at manipulating attributes of human motion data. One of the key requirements for achieving attribute manipulation on human motion is a suitable pose representation. Therefore, we design a novel continuous, rotation-based pose representation that enables the disentanglement of the human skeleton and the motion trajectory, while still allowing an accurate reconstruction of the original anatomy. The core idea of the manipulation approach is to use a transformer encoder for discovering high-level semantics, and a diffusion probabilistic model for modeling the remaining stochastic variations. We show that the embedding space obtained from the transformer encoder is semantically meaningful and linear. This enables the manipulation of high-level attributes, by discovering their linear direction of change in the semantic embedding space and moving the embedding along said direction. All code and data is made publicly available.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[PREIG: Physics-informed and Reinforcement-driven Interpretable GRU for Commodity Demand Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21710v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately forecasting commodity demand remains a critical challenge due to volatile market dynamics, nonlinear dependencies, and the need for economically consistent predictions. This paper introduces PREIG, a novel deep learning framework tailored for commodity demand forecasting. The model uniquely integrates a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architecture with physics-informed neural network (PINN) principles by embedding a domain-specific economic constraint: the negative elasticity between price and demand. This constraint is enforced through a customized loss function that penalizes violations of the physical rule, ensuring that model predictions remain interpretable and aligned with economic theory. To further enhance predictive performance and stability, PREIG incorporates a hybrid optimization strategy that couples NAdam and L-BFGS with Population-Based Training (POP). Experiments across multiple commodities datasets demonstrate that PREIG significantly outperforms traditional econometric models (ARIMA,GARCH) and deep learning baselines (BPNN,RNN) in both RMSE and MAPE. When compared with GRU,PREIG maintains good explainability while still performing well in prediction. By bridging domain knowledge, optimization theory and deep learning, PREIG provides a robust, interpretable, and scalable solution for high-dimensional nonlinear time series forecasting in economy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Local Attention Mechanism: Boosting the Transformer Architecture for Long-Sequence Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03805v3)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have become the leading choice in natural language processing over other deep learning architectures. This trend has also permeated the field of time series analysis, especially for long-horizon forecasting, showcasing promising results both in performance and running time. In this paper, we introduce Local Attention Mechanism (LAM), an efficient attention mechanism tailored for time series analysis. This mechanism exploits the continuity properties of time series to reduce the number of attention scores computed. We present an algorithm for implementing LAM in tensor algebra that runs in time and memory O(nlogn), significantly improving upon the O(n^2) time and memory complexity of traditional attention mechanisms. We also note the lack of proper datasets to evaluate long-horizon forecast models. Thus, we propose a novel set of datasets to improve the evaluation of models addressing long-horizon forecasting challenges. Our experimental analysis demonstrates that the vanilla transformer architecture magnified with LAM surpasses state-of-the-art models, including the vanilla attention mechanism. These results confirm the effectiveness of our approach and highlight a range of future challenges in long-sequence time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[GUARD-CAN: Graph-Understanding and Recurrent Architecture for CAN Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21640v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern in-vehicle networks face various cyber threats due to the lack of encryption and authentication in the Controller Area Network (CAN). To address this security issue, this paper presents GUARD-CAN, an anomaly detection framework that combines graph-based representation learning with time-series modeling. GUARD-CAN splits CAN messages into fixed-length windows and converts each window into a graph that preserves message order. To detect anomalies in the timeaware and structure-aware context at the same window, GUARD-CAN takes advantage of the overcomplete Autoencoder (AE) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to generate graph embedding vectors. The model groups these vectors into sequences and feeds them into the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to detect temporal anomaly patterns across the graphs. GUARD-CAN performs anomaly detection at both the sequence level and the window level, and this allows multi-perspective performance evaluation. The model also verifies the importance of window size selection through an analysis based on Shannon entropy. As a result, GUARD-CAN shows that the proposed model detects four types of CAN attacks (flooding, fuzzing, replay and spoofing attacks) effectively without relying on complex feature engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments:12 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables; accepted to the 26th World Conference on Information Security Applications (WISA 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Stochastic Differential Equation Models for Latent Manifold Learning in Neural Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21531v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The manifold hypothesis suggests that high-dimensional neural time series lie on a low-dimensional manifold shaped by simpler underlying dynamics. To uncover this structure, latent dynamical variable models such as state-space models, recurrent neural networks, neural ordinary differential equations, and Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models are widely used. We propose a novel hierarchical stochastic differential equation (SDE) model that balances computational efficiency and interpretability, addressing key limitations of existing methods. Our model assumes the trajectory of a manifold can be reconstructed from a sparse set of samples from the manifold trajectory. The latent space is modeled using Brownian bridge SDEs, with points - specified in both time and value - sampled from a multivariate marked point process. These Brownian bridges define the drift of a second set of SDEs, which are then mapped to the observed data. This yields a continuous, differentiable latent process capable of modeling arbitrarily complex time series as the number of manifold points increases. We derive training and inference procedures and show that the computational cost of inference scales linearly with the length of the observation data. We then validate our model on both synthetic data and neural recordings to demonstrate that it accurately recovers the underlying manifold structure and scales effectively with data dimensionality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stochastic forest transition model dynamics and parameter estimation via deep learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21486v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forest transitions, characterized by dynamic shifts between forest, agricultural, and abandoned lands, are complex phenomena. This study developed a stochastic differential equation model to capture the intricate dynamics of these transitions. We established the existence of global positive solutions for the model and conducted numerical analyses to assess the impact of model parameters on deforestation incentives. To address the challenge of parameter estimation, we proposed a novel deep learning approach that estimates all model parameters from a single sample containing time-series observations of forest and agricultural land proportions. This innovative approach enables us to understand forest transition dynamics and deforestation trends at any future time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detection of a Sparse Change in High-Dimensional Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21442v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consider the detection of a sparse change in high-dimensional time-series. We introduce Sparsity Likelihood-based (SL-based) score and the change-points detection procedure in multivariate normal model with general covariance structure. SL-based algorithm is proved to achieve that supremum of error probabilities converges to 0. We run the simulation studies for SL-based algorithm and also illustrate its applications to a S&P500 dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Multi-Tier Supply Chain Ordering with LNN+XGBoost: Mitigating the Bullwhip Effect](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21383v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supply chain management faces significant challenges, including demand fluctuations, inventory imbalances, and amplified upstream order variability due to the bullwhip effect. Traditional methods, such as simple moving averages, struggle to address dynamic market conditions. Emerging machine learning techniques, including LSTM, reinforcement learning, and XGBoost, offer potential solutions but are limited by computational complexity, training inefficiencies, or constraints in time-series modeling. Liquid Neural Networks, inspired by dynamic biological systems, present a promising alternative due to their adaptability, low computational cost, and robustness to noise, making them suitable for real-time decision-making and edge computing. Despite their success in applications like autonomous vehicles and medical monitoring, their potential in supply chain optimization remains underexplored. This study introduces a hybrid LNN and XGBoost model to optimize ordering strategies in multi-tier supply chains. By leveraging LNN's dynamic feature extraction and XGBoost's global optimization capabilities, the model aims to mitigate the bullwhip effect and enhance cumulative profitability. The research investigates how local and global synergies within the hybrid framework address the dual demands of adaptability and efficiency in SCM. The proposed approach fills a critical gap in existing methodologies, offering an innovative solution for dynamic and efficient supply chain management.</p></details> |  |
| **[TiVy: Time Series Visual Summary for Scalable Visualization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18972v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visualizing multiple time series presents fundamental tradeoffs between scalability and visual clarity. Time series capture the behavior of many large-scale real-world processes, from stock market trends to urban activities. Users often gain insights by visualizing them as line charts, juxtaposing or superposing multiple time series to compare them and identify trends and patterns. However, existing representations struggle with scalability: when covering long time spans, leading to visual clutter from too many small multiples or overlapping lines. We propose TiVy, a new algorithm that summarizes time series using sequential patterns. It transforms the series into a set of symbolic sequences based on subsequence visual similarity using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), then constructs a disjoint grouping of similar subsequences based on the frequent sequential patterns. The grouping result, a visual summary of time series, provides uncluttered superposition with fewer small multiples. Unlike common clustering techniques, TiVy extracts similar subsequences (of varying lengths) aligned in time. We also present an interactive time series visualization that renders large-scale time series in real-time. Our experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm (1) extracts clear and accurate patterns when visualizing time series data, (2) achieves a significant speed-up (1000X) compared to a straightforward DTW clustering. We also demonstrate the efficiency of our approach to explore hidden structures in massive time series data in two usage scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in TVCG (IEEE VIS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[A Contrastive Diffusion-based Network (CDNet) for Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21357v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models are widely used for time series classification (TSC) due to their scalability and efficiency. However, their performance degrades under challenging data conditions such as class similarity, multimodal distributions, and noise. To address these limitations, we propose CDNet, a Contrastive Diffusion-based Network that enhances existing classifiers by generating informative positive and negative samples via a learned diffusion process. Unlike traditional diffusion models that denoise individual samples, CDNet learns transitions between samples--both within and across classes--through convolutional approximations of reverse diffusion steps. We introduce a theoretically grounded CNN-based mechanism to enable both denoising and mode coverage, and incorporate an uncertainty-weighted composite loss for robust training. Extensive experiments on the UCR Archive and simulated datasets demonstrate that CDNet significantly improves state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning classifiers, particularly under noisy, similar, and multimodal conditions.</p></details> | 19 pages, conference |
| **[Bayesian Inference for High-dimensional Time Series with a Stationary Directed Acyclic Graphical Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23563v5)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multivariate time series analysis, understanding the underlying causal relationships among variables is often of interest for various applications. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) provide a powerful framework for representing causal dependencies. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian approach for modeling multivariate time series where conditional independencies and causal structure are encoded by a DAG. The proposed model allows structural properties such as stationarity to be easily accommodated. Given the application, we further extend the model for matrix-variate time series. We take a Bayesian approach to inference, and a ``immersion-posterior'' based efficient computational algorithm is developed. The posterior convergence properties of the proposed method are established along with two identifiability results for the unrestricted structural equation models. The utility of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation studies and real data analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Brake Onset Detection in Naturalistic Driving Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17943v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Response timing measures play a crucial role in the assessment of automated driving systems (ADS) in collision avoidance scenarios, including but not limited to establishing human benchmarks and comparing ADS to human driver response performance. For example, measuring the response time (of a human driver or ADS) to a conflict requires the determination of a stimulus onset and a response onset. In existing studies, response onset relies on manual annotation or vehicle control signals such as accelerator and brake pedal movements. These methods are not applicable when analyzing large scale data where vehicle control signals are not available. This holds in particular for the rapidly expanding sets of ADS log data where the behavior of surrounding road users is observed via onboard sensors. To advance evaluation techniques for ADS and enable measuring response timing when vehicle control signals are not available, we developed a simple and efficient algorithm, based on a piecewise linear acceleration model, to automatically estimate brake onset that can be applied to any type of driving data that includes vehicle longitudinal time series data. We also proposed a manual annotation method to identify brake onset and used it as ground truth for validation. R^2 was used as a confidence metric to measure the accuracy of the algorithm, and its classification performance was analyzed using naturalistic collision avoidance data of both ADS and humans, where our method was validated against human manual annotation. Although our algorithm is subject to certain limitations, it is efficient, generalizable, applicable to any road user and scenario types, and is highly configurable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Cognition from fMRI:A Comparative Study of Graph, Transformer, and Kernel Models Across Task and Rest Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21016v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting cognition from neuroimaging data in healthy individuals offers insights into the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive abilities, with potential applications in precision medicine and early detection of neurological and psychiatric conditions. This study systematically benchmarked classical machine learning (Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR)) and advanced deep learning (DL) models (Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Transformer-GNN (TGNN)) for cognitive prediction using Resting-state (RS), Working Memory, and Language task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset. Our results, based on R2 scores, Pearson correlation coefficient, and mean absolute error, revealed that task-based fMRI, eliciting neural responses directly tied to cognition, outperformed RS fMRI in predicting cognitive behavior. Among the methods compared, a GNN combining structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) consistently achieved the highest performance across all fMRI modalities; however, its advantage over KRR using FC alone was not statistically significant. The TGNN, designed to model temporal dynamics with SC as a prior, performed competitively with FC-based approaches for task-fMRI but struggled with RS data, where its performance aligned with the lower-performing GNN that directly used fMRI time-series data as node features. These findings emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate model architectures and feature representations to fully leverage the spatial and temporal richness of neuroimaging data. This study highlights the potential of multimodal graph-aware DL models to combine SC and FC for cognitive prediction, as well as the promise of Transformer-based approaches for capturing temporal dynamics. By providing a comprehensive comparison of models, this work serves as a guide for advancing brain-behavior modeling using fMRI, SC and DL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary version; a revised version will be uploaded later</p></details> |
| **[From Entanglement to Alignment: Representation Space Decomposition for Unsupervised Time Series Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20968v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain shift poses a fundamental challenge in time series analysis, where models trained on source domain often fail dramatically when applied in target domain with different yet similar distributions. While current unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods attempt to align cross-domain feature distributions, they typically treat features as indivisible entities, ignoring their intrinsic compositions that governs domain adaptation. We introduce DARSD, a novel UDA framework with theoretical explainability that explicitly realizes UDA tasks from the perspective of representation space decomposition. Our core insight is that effective domain adaptation requires not just alignment, but principled disentanglement of transferable knowledge from mixed representations. DARSD consists three synergistic components: (I) An adversarial learnable common invariant basis that projects original features into a domain-invariant subspace while preserving semantic content; (II) A prototypical pseudo-labeling mechanism that dynamically separates target features based on confidence, hindering error accumulation; (III) A hybrid contrastive optimization strategy that simultaneously enforces feature clustering and consistency while mitigating emerging distribution gaps. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets (WISDM, HAR, HHAR, and MFD) demonstrate DARSD's superiority against 12 UDA algorithms, achieving optimal performance in 35 out of 53 cross-domain scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Precision spectral estimation at sub-Hz frequencies: closed-form posteriors and Bayesian noise projection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20846v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a Bayesian method for estimating spectral quantities in multivariate Gaussian time series. The approach, based on periodograms and Wishart statistics, yields closed-form expressions at any given frequency for the marginal posterior distributions of the individual power spectral densities, the pairwise coherence, and the multiple coherence, as well as for the joint posterior distribution of the full cross-spectral density matrix. In the context of noise projection - where one series is modeled as a linear combination of filtered versions of the others, plus a background component - the method also provides closed-form posteriors for both the susceptibilities, i.e., the filter transfer functions, and the power spectral density of the background. Originally developed for the analysis of the data from the European Space Agency's LISA Pathfinder mission, the method is particularly well-suited to very-low-frequency data, where long observation times preclude averaging over large sets of periodograms, which would otherwise allow these to be treated as approximately normally distributed.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Towards Explainable Deep Clustering for Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20840v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep clustering uncovers hidden patterns and groups in complex time series data, yet its opaque decision-making limits use in safety-critical settings. This survey offers a structured overview of explainable deep clustering for time series, collecting current methods and their real-world applications. We thoroughly discuss and compare peer-reviewed and preprint papers through application domains across healthcare, finance, IoT, and climate science. Our analysis reveals that most work relies on autoencoder and attention architectures, with limited support for streaming, irregularly sampled, or privacy-preserved series, and interpretability is still primarily treated as an add-on. To push the field forward, we outline six research opportunities: (1) combining complex networks with built-in interpretability; (2) setting up clear, faithfulness-focused evaluation metrics for unsupervised explanations; (3) building explainers that adapt to live data streams; (4) crafting explanations tailored to specific domains; (5) adding human-in-the-loop methods that refine clusters and explanations together; and (6) improving our understanding of how time series clustering models work internally. By making interpretability a primary design goal rather than an afterthought, we propose the groundwork for the next generation of trustworthy deep clustering time series analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, accepted at TempXAI Workshop at ECML-PKDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Watermarking Large Language Model-based Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20762v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model-based Time Series Forecasting (LLMTS) has shown remarkable promise in handling complex and diverse temporal data, representing a significant step toward foundation models for time series analysis. However, this emerging paradigm introduces two critical challenges. First, the substantial commercial potential and resource-intensive development raise urgent concerns about intellectual property (IP) protection. Second, their powerful time series forecasting capabilities may be misused to produce misleading or fabricated deepfake time series data. To address these concerns, we explore watermarking the outputs of LLMTS models, that is, embedding imperceptible signals into the generated time series data that remain detectable by specialized algorithms. We propose a novel post-hoc watermarking framework, Waltz, which is broadly compatible with existing LLMTS models. Waltz is inspired by the empirical observation that time series patch embeddings are rarely aligned with a specific set of LLM tokens, which we term ``cold tokens''. Leveraging this insight, Waltz embeds watermarks by rewiring the similarity statistics between patch embeddings and cold token embeddings, and detects watermarks using similarity z-scores. To minimize potential side effects, we introduce a similarity-based embedding position identification strategy and employ projected gradient descent to constrain the watermark noise within a defined boundary. Extensive experiments using two popular LLMTS models across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that Waltz achieves high watermark detection accuracy with minimal impact on the quality of the generated time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Fuzzy Time Series Forecasting via Partially Asymmetric Convolution and Sub-Sliding Window Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20641v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>At present, state-of-the-art forecasting models are short of the ability to capture spatio-temporal dependency and synthesize global information at the stage of learning. To address this issue, in this paper, through the adaptive fuzzified construction of temporal data, we propose a novel convolutional architecture with partially asymmetric design based on the scheme of sliding window to realize accurate time series forecasting. First, the construction strategy of traditional fuzzy time series is improved to further extract short and long term temporal interrelation, which enables every time node to automatically possess corresponding global information and inner relationships among them in a restricted sliding window and the process does not require human involvement. Second, a bilateral Atrous algorithm is devised to reduce calculation demand of the proposed model without sacrificing global characteristics of elements. And it also allows the model to avoid processing redundant information. Third, after the transformation of time series, a partially asymmetric convolutional architecture is designed to more flexibly mine data features by filters in different directions on feature maps, which gives the convolutional neural network (CNN) the ability to construct sub-windows within existing sliding windows to model at a more fine-grained level. And after obtaining the time series information at different levels, the multi-scale features from different sub-windows will be sent to the corresponding network layer for time series information fusion. Compared with other competitive modern models, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on most of popular time series datasets, which is fully verified by the experimental results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Explainable Stock Predictions with Tweets Using Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20535v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stock price movements are influenced by many factors, and alongside historical price data, tex-tual information is a key source. Public news and social media offer valuable insights into market sentiment and emerging events. These sources are fast-paced, diverse, and significantly impact future stock trends. Recently, LLMs have enhanced financial analysis, but prompt-based methods still have limitations, such as input length restrictions and difficulties in predicting sequences of varying lengths. Additionally, most models rely on dense computational layers, which are resource-intensive. To address these challenges, we propose the FTS- Text-MoE model, which combines numerical data with key summaries from news and tweets using point embeddings, boosting prediction accuracy through the integration of factual textual data. The model uses a Mixture of Experts (MoE) Transformer decoder to process both data types. By activating only a subset of model parameters, it reduces computational costs. Furthermore, the model features multi-resolution prediction heads, enabling flexible forecasting of financial time series at different scales. Experimental results show that FTS-Text-MoE outperforms baseline methods in terms of investment returns and Sharpe ratio, demonstrating its superior accuracy and ability to predict future market trends.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Interpretable Anomaly-Based DDoS Detection in AI-RAN with XAI and LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21193v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next generation Radio Access Networks (RANs) introduce programmability, intelligence, and near real-time control through intelligent controllers, enabling enhanced security within the RAN and across broader 5G/6G infrastructures. This paper presents a comprehensive survey highlighting opportunities, challenges, and research gaps for Large Language Models (LLMs)-assisted explainable (XAI) intrusion detection (IDS) for secure future RAN environments. Motivated by this, we propose an LLM interpretable anomaly-based detection system for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks using multivariate time series key performance measures (KPMs), extracted from E2 nodes, within the Near Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC). An LSTM-based model is trained to identify malicious User Equipment (UE) behavior based on these KPMs. To enhance transparency, we apply post-hoc local explainability methods such as LIME and SHAP to interpret individual predictions. Furthermore, LLMs are employed to convert technical explanations into natural-language insights accessible to non-expert users. Experimental results on real 5G network KPMs demonstrate that our framework achieves high detection accuracy (F1-score > 0.96) while delivering actionable and interpretable outputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trends in Motion Prediction Toward Deployable and Generalizable Autonomy: A Revisit and Perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09074v2)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion prediction, the anticipation of future agent states or scene evolution, is rooted in human cognition, bridging perception and decision-making. It enables intelligent systems, such as robots and self-driving cars, to act safely in dynamic, human-involved environments, and informs broader time-series reasoning challenges. With advances in methods, representations, and datasets, the field has seen rapid progress, reflected in quickly evolving benchmark results. Yet, when state-of-the-art methods are deployed in the real world, they often struggle to generalize to open-world conditions and fall short of deployment standards. This reveals a gap between research benchmarks, which are often idealized or ill-posed, and real-world complexity. To address this gap, this survey revisits the generalization and deployability of motion prediction models, with an emphasis on the applications of robotics, autonomous driving, and human motion. We first offer a comprehensive taxonomy of motion prediction methods, covering representations, modeling strategies, application domains, and evaluation protocols. We then study two key challenges: (1) how to push motion prediction models to be deployable to realistic deployment standards, where motion prediction does not act in a vacuum, but functions as one module of closed-loop autonomy stacks - it takes input from the localization and perception, and informs downstream planning and control. 2) how to generalize motion prediction models from limited seen scenarios/datasets to the open-world settings. Throughout the paper, we highlight critical open challenges to guide future work, aiming to recalibrate the community's efforts, fostering progress that is not only measurable but also meaningful for real-world applications.

| **[Semi-Supervised Risk Control via Prediction-Powered Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11174v2)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS) framework is a general tool for transforming the output of any machine learning model to design a predictive rule with rigorous error rate control. The key idea behind this framework is to use labeled hold-out calibration data to tune a hyper-parameter that affects the error rate of the resulting prediction rule. However, the limitation of such a calibration scheme is that with limited hold-out data, the tuned hyper-parameter becomes noisy and leads to a prediction rule with an error rate that is often unnecessarily conservative. To overcome this sample-size barrier, we introduce a semi-supervised calibration procedure that leverages unlabeled data to rigorously tune the hyper-parameter without compromising statistical validity. Our procedure builds upon the prediction-powered inference framework, carefully tailoring it to risk-controlling tasks. We demonstrate the benefits and validity of our proposal through two real-data experiments: few-shot image classification and early time series classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[IFD: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Insider Filing Violation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20162v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Insider trading violations, particularly delayed disclosures of Form 4 filings, remain a persistent challenge for financial market surveillance. Despite regulatory requirements such as the two-business-day rule of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), enforcement is limited by the lack of large-scale, labeled datasets and task-specific benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce Insider Filing Delay (IFD), the first and largest publicly available dataset for insider disclosure behavior, comprising over one million Form 4 transactions spanning two decades (2002-2025), with structured annotations on delay status, insider roles, governance factors, and firm-level financial indicators. IFD enables the first large-scale formulation of strategic disclosure violation detection as a binary classification task grounded in regulatory compliance. To demonstrate the utility of IFD, we propose MaBoost, a hybrid framework combining a Mamba-based state space encoder with XGBoost, achieving high accuracy and interpretability in identifying high-risk behavioral patterns. Experiments across statistical baselines, deep learning models, and large language models confirm that MaBoost outperforms prior approaches, achieving an F1-score of up to 99.47% under constrained regulatory settings. IFD provides a realistic, reproducible, and behavior-rich benchmark for developing AI models in financial compliance, regulatory forensics, and interpretable time-series classification.

| **[Foundation Models Knowledge Distillation For Battery Capacity Degradation Forecast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08151v3)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate estimation of lithium-ion battery capacity degradation is critical for enhancing the reliability and safety of battery operations. Traditional expert models, tailored to specific scenarios, provide isolated estimations. With the rapid advancement of data-driven techniques, a series of general-purpose time-series foundation models have been developed. However, foundation models specifically designed for battery capacity degradation remain largely unexplored. To enable zero-shot generalization in battery degradation prediction using large model technology, this study proposes a degradation-aware fine-tuning strategy for time-series foundation models. We apply this strategy to fine-tune the Timer model on approximately 10 GB of open-source battery charge discharge data. Validation on our released CycleLife-SJTUIE dataset demonstrates that the fine-tuned Battery-Timer possesses strong zero-shot generalization capability in capacity degradation forecasting. To address the computational challenges of deploying large models, we further propose a knowledge distillation framework that transfers the knowledge of pre-trained foundation models into compact expert models. Distillation results across several state-of-the-art time-series expert models confirm that foundation model knowledge significantly improves the multi-condition generalization of expert models.</p></details> |  |

Using daily stock data from the S&P 500 (2020-2024), we construct dependency networks via Vector Autoregression (VAR) and Forecast Error Variance Decomposition (FEVD), transforming influence relationships into a cost-based network. Specifically, FEVD breaks down the VAR's forecast error variance to quantify how much each stock's shocks contribute to another's uncertainty information we invert to form influence-based edge weights in our network. By applying the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm, we extract the core inter-stock structure and identify central stocks through degree centrality. A dynamic portfolio is constructed using the top-ranked stocks, with capital allocated based on Value at Risk (VaR). To refine stock selection, we incorporate forecasts from ARIMA and Neural Network Autoregressive (NNAR) models. Trading simulations over a one-year period demonstrate that the MST-based strategies outperform a buy-and-hold benchmark, with the tuned NNAR-enhanced strategy achieving a 63.74% return versus 18.00% for the benchmark. Our results highlight the potential of combining network structures, predictive modeling, and risk metrics to improve adaptive financial decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[$K^2$VAE: A Koopman-Kalman Enhanced Variational AutoEncoder for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23017v3)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (PTSF) plays a crucial role in decision-making across various fields, including economics, energy, and transportation. Most existing methods excell at short-term forecasting, while overlooking the hurdles of Long-term Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (LPTSF). As the forecast horizon extends, the inherent nonlinear dynamics have a significant adverse effect on prediction accuracy, and make generative models inefficient by increasing the cost of each iteration. To overcome these limitations, we introduce $K^2$VAE, an efficient VAE-based generative model that leverages a KoopmanNet to transform nonlinear time series into a linear dynamical system, and devises a KalmanNet to refine predictions and model uncertainty in such linear system, which reduces error accumulation in long-term forecasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $K^2$VAE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both short- and long-term PTSF, providing a more efficient and accurate solution.</p></details> |  |

Our pipeline leveraged rich multimodal representations from various state-of-the-art pretrained models across video (V-JEPA2), speech (Whisper), text (Llama 3.2), vision-text (InternVL3), and vision-text-audio (Qwen2.5-Omni). These features extracted from the models were linearly projected to a latent space, temporally aligned to the fMRI time series, and finally mapped to cortical parcels through a lightweight encoder comprising a shared group head plus subject-specific residual heads. We trained hundreds of model variants across hyperparameter settings, validated them on held-out movies and assembled ensembles targeted to each parcel in each subject. Our final submission achieved a mean Pearson's correlation of 0.2085 on the test split of withheld out-of-distribution movies, placing our team in fourth place for the competition. We further discuss a last-minute optimization that would have raised us to second place. Our results highlight how combining features from models trained in different modalities, using a simple architecture consisting of shared-subject and single-subject components, and conducting comprehensive model selection and ensembling improves generalization of encoding models to novel movie stimuli.

| **[Elucidating the Design Choice of Probability Paths in Flow Matching for Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03229v3)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative modeling and has been extended to probabilistic time series forecasting in latent spaces. However, the impact of the specific choice of probability path model on forecasting performance remains under-explored. In this work, we demonstrate that forecasting spatio-temporal data with flow matching is highly sensitive to the selection of the probability path model. Motivated by this insight, we propose a novel probability path model designed to improve forecasting performance. Our empirical results across various dynamical system benchmarks show that our model achieves faster convergence during training and improved predictive performance compared to existing probability path models. Importantly, our approach is efficient during inference, requiring only a few sampling steps. This makes our proposed model practical for real-world applications and opens new avenues for probabilistic forecasting.</p></details> | 35 pages |

Existing state-of-the-art methods, like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), achieve high imputation accuracy; however, they suffer from significant computational costs and are notably time-consuming due to their iterative nature. In this work, we propose CoSTI, an innovative adaptation of Consistency Models (CMs) for the MTSI domain. CoSTI employs Consistency Training to achieve comparable imputation quality to DDPMs while drastically reducing inference times, making it more suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate CoSTI across multiple datasets and missing data scenarios, demonstrating up to a 98% reduction in imputation time with performance on par with diffusion-based models. This work bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in generative imputation tasks, providing a scalable solution for handling missing data in critical spatio-temporal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |
| **[Identification and estimation for matrix time series CP-factor models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05634v3)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new method for identifying and estimating the CP-factor models for matrix time series. Unlike the generalized eigenanalysis-based method of Chang et al. (2023) for which the convergence rates of the associated estimators may suffer from small eigengaps as the asymptotic theory is based on some matrix perturbation analysis, the proposed new method enjoys faster convergence rates which are free from any eigengaps. It achieves this by turning the problem into a joint diagonalization of several matrices whose elements are determined by a basis of a linear system, and by choosing the basis carefully to avoid near co-linearity (see Proposition 5 and Section 4.3). Furthermore, unlike Chang et al. (2023) which requires the two factor loading matrices to be full-ranked, the proposed new method can handle rank-deficient factor loading matrices. Illustration with both simulated and real matrix time series data shows the advantages of the proposed new method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Skin-Machine Interface with Multimodal Contact Motion Classifier](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19760v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel framework for utilizing skin sensors as a new operation interface of complex robots. The skin sensors employed in this study possess the capability to quantify multimodal tactile information at multiple contact points. The time-series data generated from these sensors is anticipated to facilitate the classification of diverse contact motions exhibited by an operator. By mapping the classification results with robot motion primitives, a diverse range of robot motions can be generated by altering the manner in which the skin sensors are interacted with. In this paper, we focus on a learning-based contact motion classifier employing recurrent neural networks. This classifier is a pivotal factor in the success of this framework. Furthermore, we elucidate the requisite conditions for software-hardware designs. Firstly, multimodal sensing and its comprehensive encoding significantly contribute to the enhancement of classification accuracy and learning stability. Utilizing all modalities simultaneously as inputs to the classifier proves to be an effective approach. Secondly, it is essential to mount the skin sensors on a flexible and compliant support to enable the activation of three-axis accelerometers. These accelerometers are capable of measuring horizontal tactile information, thereby enhancing the correlation with other modalities. Furthermore, they serve to absorb the noises generated by the robot's movements during deployment. Through these discoveries, the accuracy of the developed classifier surpassed 95 %, enabling the dual-arm mobile manipulator to execute a diverse range of tasks via the Skin-Machine Interface. https://youtu.be/UjUXT4Z4BC8</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures (accepted in Humanoids2025)</p></details> |

Making sound trading decisions to generate profit is particularly difficult under such conditions. To address this, we propose four novel loss functions to drive decision-making for a portfolio of stocks. These functions account for the potential profits or losses based with respect to buying or shorting respective stocks, enabling potentially any artificial neural network to directly learn an effective trading strategy. Despite the high volatility in stock market fluctuations over time, training time-series models such as transformers on these loss functions resulted in trading strategies that generated significant profits on a portfolio of 50 different S&P 500 company stocks as compared to a benchmark reinforcment learning techniques and a baseline buy and hold method. As an example, using 2021, 2022 and 2023 as three test periods, the Crossformer model adapted with our best loss function was most consistent, resulting in returns of 51.42%, 51.04% and 48.62% respectively. In comparison, the best performing state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods, PPO and DDPG, only delivered maximum profits of around 41%, 2.81% and 41.58% for the same periods.

Despite extensive research in domains like computer vision and natural language processing, UDA remains underexplored for time series data, which has widespread real-world applications ranging from medicine and manufacturing to earth observation and human activity recognition. Our paper addresses this gap by introducing a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating UDA techniques for time series classification, with a focus on deep learning methods. We provide seven new benchmark datasets covering various domain shifts and temporal dynamics, facilitating fair and standardized UDA method assessments with state of the art neural network backbones (e.g. Inception) for time series data. This benchmark offers insights into the strengths and limitations of the evaluated approaches while preserving the unsupervised nature of domain adaptation, making it directly applicable to practical problems. Our paper serves as a vital resource for researchers and practitioners, advancing domain adaptation solutions for time series data and fostering innovation in this critical field.

| **[Modality Agnostic Efficient Long Range Encoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19409v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The long-context capability of recent large transformer models can be surmised to rely on techniques such as attention/model parallelism, as well as hardware-level optimizations. While these strategies allow input lengths to scale to millions of tokens, they do not fundamentally mitigate the quadratic computational and memory complexity of the core attention mechanism. In this paper, we address the challenge of long-context processing on a single device using generic implementations by reducing the quadratic memory footprint and inference cost. Existing approaches to extend the context length for generic single device implementations -- such as token merging and modified attentions -- are often modality specific and attain a suboptimal tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose MAELRE (Modality Agnostic Efficient Long Range Encoder), a unified and efficient transformer architecture designed for long-range encoding across diverse modalities. MAELRE integrates token merging with attention approximation, progressively merging tokens at different stages of internal computational blocks. It employs a lightweight attention approximation when the number of tokens is large, and switches to standard dot-product attention as the sequence becomes shorter through successive aggregation. We demonstrate that MAELRE achieves superior accuracy while reducing computational cost compared to existing long-context models on classification tasks spanning multiple modalities, including text, time series, audio, and vision.</p></details> |  |

We present a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series recorded while four subjects watched almost 80 hours of movies provided by the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Modality-specific bidirectional RNNs encode temporal dynamics; their hidden states are fused and passed to a second recurrent layer, and lightweight subject-specific heads output responses for 1000 cortical parcels. Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions. Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r = 0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject (Subject 5).

Reservoir computing (RC) offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional deep learning by training only the read-out layer while employing a randomly structured and fixed reservoir network. Despite its advantages, the largely random reservoir graph architecture often results in suboptimal and oversized networks with poorly understood dynamics. Addressing this issue, we propose a novel Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing (DyRC) framework that systematically infers the reservoir network structure directly from the input training sequence. This work proposes to employ the visibility graph (VG) technique, which converts time series data into networks by representing measurement points as nodes linked by mutual visibility. The reservoir network is constructed by directly adopting the VG network from a training data sequence, leveraging the parameter-free visibility graph approach to avoid expensive hyperparameter tuning. This process results in a reservoir that is directly informed by the specific dynamics of the prediction task under study. We assess the DyRC-VG method through prediction tasks involving the canonical nonlinear Duffing oscillator, evaluating prediction accuracy and consistency. Compared to an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph of the same size, spectral radius, and comparable density, we observe higher prediction quality and more consistent performance over repeated implementations in the DyRC-VG.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures.

Unlike standard score-based models that treat price trajectories as generic numerical sequences, our method injects noise proportionally to asset prices at each time step, reflecting the heteroskedasticity observed in financial time series. By accurately balancing the drift and diffusion terms, we show that the resulting log-price process reduces to a variance-exploding stochastic differential equation, aligning with the formulation in score-based generative models. The reverse-time generative process is trained via denoising score matching using a Transformer-based architecture adapted from the Conditional Score-based Diffusion Imputation (CSDI) framework. Empirical evaluations on historical stock data demonstrate that our model reproduces key stylized facts heavy-tailed return distributions, volatility clustering, and the leverage effect more realistically than conventional diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

Traditional deep learning models, such as long short-term memory networks and multilayer perceptrons, often struggle to generalize across shifting market conditions, highlighting the need for a more adaptive and interpretable approach. To address this, we introduce Kolmogorov-Arnold networks for stock prediction and explainable regimes (KASPER), a novel framework that integrates regime detection, sparse spline-based function modeling, and symbolic rule extraction. The framework identifies hidden market conditions using a Gumbel-Softmax-based mechanism, enabling regime-specific forecasting. For each regime, it employs Kolmogorov-Arnold networks with sparse spline activations to capture intricate price behaviors while maintaining robustness. Interpretability is achieved through symbolic learning based on Monte Carlo Shapley values, which extracts human-readable rules tailored to each regime. Applied to real-world financial time series from Yahoo Finance, the model achieves an $R^2$ score of 0.89, a Sharpe Ratio of 12.02, and a mean squared error as low as 0.0001, outperforming existing methods.

Empowered by this learning capability, it has become a powerful tool for solving complex problems and is the core driver of many groundbreaking technologies and innovations. Building a deep learning model is challenging due to the algorithm's complexity and the dynamic nature of real-world problems. Several studies have reviewed deep learning concepts and applications.

We identify several factors that lead existing models to systematically underperform on low-magnitude and sparse time series, including loss functions with implicit biases toward high-magnitude series, training-time sampling methods, and limitations of time series encoding methods. SPADE-S is a robust forecasting architecture that significantly reduces magnitude- and sparsity-based systematic biases and improves overall prediction accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that SPADE-S outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across a diverse set of use cases in demand forecasting. In particular, we show that, depending on the quantile forecast and magnitude of the series, SPADE-S can improve forecast accuracy by up to 15%. This results in P90 overall forecast accuracy gains of 2.21%, 6.58%, and 4.28%, and P50 forecast accuracy gains of 0.92%, 0.77%, and 1.95%, respectively, for each of three distinct datasets, ranging from 3 million to 700 million series, from a large online retailer.</p></details> |  |
| **[VISTA-SSM: Varying and Irregular Sampling Time-series Analysis via State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21527v3)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce VISTA, a clustering approach for multivariate and irregularly sampled time series based on a parametric state space mixture model. VISTA is specifically designed for the unsupervised identification of groups in datasets originating from healthcare and psychology where such sampling issues are commonplace. Our approach adapts linear Gaussian state space models (LGSSMs) to provide a flexible parametric framework for fitting a wide range of time series dynamics. The clustering approach itself is based on the assumption that the population can be represented as a mixture of a fixed number of LGSSMs. VISTA's model formulation allows for an explicit derivation of the log-likelihood function, from which we develop an expectation-maximization scheme for fitting model parameters to the observed data samples. Our algorithmic implementation is designed to handle populations of multivariate time series that can exhibit large changes in sampling rate as well as irregular sampling. We evaluate the versatility and accuracy of our approach on simulated and real-world datasets, including demographic trends, wearable sensor data, epidemiological time series, and ecological momentary assessments. Our results indicate that VISTA outperforms most comparable standard times series clustering methods. We provide an open-source implementation of VISTA in Python.</p></details> |  |
| **[State of Health Estimation of Batteries Using a Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence-Inverted Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18320v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of battery-powered vehicles and energy storage systems over the past decade has made battery health monitoring increasingly critical. Batteries play a central role in the efficiency and safety of these systems, yet they inevitably degrade over time due to repeated charge-discharge cycles. This degradation leads to reduced energy efficiency and potential overheating, posing significant safety concerns. Accurate estimation of a State of Health (SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability and safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs, transformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from discharge cycle data. However, these models struggle with the irregularities inherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at non-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly. To address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences rather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and compromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel architecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT). TIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent irregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention mechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence information. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show that TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50% reduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below 0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for broader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series data.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

We show the proposed estimators are consistent and follow normal distributions in large samples under weak conditions. We also provide a precise characterisation of the leading bias term due to smoothing, which has not been done before. We demonstrate the usefulness of our general results by establishing primitive conditions for local (quasi-)maximum-likelihood estimators of time-varying models threshold autoregressions, ARCH models and Poisson autogressions with exogenous co--variates, to be normally distributed in large samples and characterise their leading biases. An empirical study of US corporate default counts demonstrates the applicability of the proposed local linear estimator for Poisson autoregression, shedding new light on the dynamic properties of US corporate defaults.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements have demonstrated the potential of multi-scale analysis approaches, which provide an effective solution for capturing these complex temporal patterns. However, existing multi-scale analysis-based time series prediction methods fail to eliminate redundant scale-shared features across multi-scale time series, resulting in the model over- or under-focusing on scale-shared features. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end Disentangled Multi-Scale framework for Time Series classification (DisMS-TS). The core idea of DisMS-TS is to eliminate redundant shared features in multi-scale time series, thereby improving prediction performance. Specifically, we propose a temporal disentanglement module to capture scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, respectively. Subsequently, to effectively learn both scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, we introduce two regularization terms that ensure the consistency of scale-shared representations and the disparity of scale-specific representations across all temporal scales. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets validate the superiority of DisMS-TS over its competitive baselines, with the accuracy improvement up to 9.71%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for presentation at the ACM International Conference on Multimedia (ACM MM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Why Do Class-Dependent Evaluation Effects Occur with Time Series Feature Attributions? A Synthetic Data Investigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11790v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating feature attribution methods represents a critical challenge in explainable AI (XAI), as researchers typically rely on perturbation-based metrics when ground truth is unavailable. However, recent work reveals that these evaluation metrics can show different performance across predicted classes within the same dataset. These "class-dependent evaluation effects" raise questions about whether perturbation analysis reliably measures attribution quality, with direct implications for XAI method development and evaluation trustworthiness. We investigate under which conditions these class-dependent effects arise by conducting controlled experiments with synthetic time series data where ground truth feature locations are known. We systematically vary feature types and class contrasts across binary classification tasks, then compare perturbation-based degradation scores with ground truth-based precision-recall metrics using multiple attribution methods. Our experiments demonstrate that class-dependent effects emerge with both evaluation approaches, even in simple scenarios with temporally localized features, triggered by basic variations in feature amplitude or temporal extent between classes. Most critically, we find that perturbation-based and ground truth metrics frequently yield contradictory assessments of attribution quality across classes, with weak correlations between evaluation approaches. These findings suggest that researchers should interpret perturbation-based metrics with care, as they may not always align with whether attributions correctly identify discriminating features. By showing this disconnect, our work points toward reconsidering what attribution evaluation actually measures and developing more rigorous evaluation methods that capture multiple dimensions of attribution quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TempXAI Workshop @ ECML-PKDD 2025 (Explainable AI for Time Series and Data Streams)</p></details> |

However, the continuity of such time series is often disrupted by clouds. In response to this challenge, we propose an innovative deep learning method that integrates cloud-free optical (Sentinel-2) observations and weather-independent (Sentinel-1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. Our approach employs a hybrid architecture combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to generate continuous Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series, highlighting the role of NDVI in the synergy between SAR and optical data. We demonstrate the significance of observation continuity by assessing the impact of the generated NDVI time series on the downstream task of grassland mowing event detection. We conducted our study in Lithuania, a country characterized by extensive cloud coverage, and compared our approach with alternative interpolation techniques (i.e., linear, Akima, quadratic). Our method outperformed these techniques, achieving an average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.024 and a coefficient of determination R^2 of 0.92. Additionally, our analysis revealed improvement in the performance of the mowing event detection, with F1-score up to 84% using two widely applied mowing detection methodologies. Our method also effectively mitigated sudden shifts and noise originating from cloudy observations, which are often missed by conventional cloud masks and adversely affect mowing detection precision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Computers and Electronics in Agriculture</p></details> |
| **[SDSC:A Structure-Aware Metric for Semantic Signal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14516v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose the Signal Dice Similarity Coefficient (SDSC), a structure-aware metric function for time series self-supervised representation learning. Most Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods for signals commonly adopt distance-based objectives such as mean squared error (MSE), which are sensitive to amplitude, invariant to waveform polarity, and unbounded in scale. These properties hinder semantic alignment and reduce interpretability. SDSC addresses this by quantifying structural agreement between temporal signals based on the intersection of signed amplitudes, derived from the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).Although SDSC is defined as a structure-aware metric, it can be used as a loss by subtracting from 1 and applying a differentiable approximation of the Heaviside function for gradient-based optimization. A hybrid loss formulation is also proposed to combine SDSC with MSE, improving stability and preserving amplitude where necessary. Experiments on forecasting and classification benchmarks demonstrate that SDSC-based pre-training achieves comparable or improved performance over MSE, particularly in in-domain and low-resource scenarios. The results suggest that structural fidelity in signal representations enhances the semantic representation quality, supporting the consideration of structure-aware metrics as viable alternatives to conventional distance-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fixing the Pitfalls of Probabilistic Time-Series Forecasting Evaluation by Kernel Quadrature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06079v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the significance of probabilistic time-series forecasting models, their evaluation metrics often involve intractable integrations. The most widely used metric, the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), is a strictly proper scoring function; however, its computation requires approximation. We found that popular CRPS estimators--specifically, the quantile-based estimator implemented in the widely used GluonTS library and the probability-weighted moment approximation--both exhibit inherent estimation biases. These biases lead to crude approximations, resulting in improper rankings of forecasting model performance when CRPS values are close. To address this issue, we introduced a kernel quadrature approach that leverages an unbiased CRPS estimator and employs cubature construction for scalable computation. Empirically, our approach consistently outperforms the two widely used CRPS estimators.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Then, we deduce the asymptotic distribution of the entropy-complexity pair, which emerged as a popular tool for summarizing the time-series dynamics. Here, we make the necessary distinction between a uniform and a non-uniform ordinal pattern distribution and, thus, obtain two different limit theorems. On this basis, we consider a test for serial dependence and check its finite-sample performance. Moreover, we use our asymptotic results to approximate the estimation uncertainty of entropy-complexity pairs.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Seasonal snow estimates are available as snow water equivalent (SWE) from process-based reanalysis products or locally from in situ measurements. While the reanalysis products are computationally expensive and available at only fixed spatial and temporal resolutions, the in situ measurements are highly localized and sparse. To address these issues and enable the analysis of the effect of a large suite of physical, morphological, and geological conditions on the presence and amount of snow, we build a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which is able to estimate the SWE based on time series input of the various physical/meteorological factors as well static spatial/morphological factors. Specifically, this model breaks down the SWE estimation into two separate tasks: (i) a classification task that indicates the presence/absence of snow on a specific day and (ii) a regression task that indicates the height of the SWE on a specific day in the case of snow presence. The model is trained using physical/in situ SWE measurements from the SNOw TELemetry (SNOTEL) snow pillows in the western United States. We will show that trained LSTM models have a classification accuracy of $\geq 93\%$ for the presence of snow and a coefficient of correlation of $\sim 0.9$ concerning their SWE estimates. We will also demonstrate that the models can generalize both spatially and temporally to previously unseen data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of journal paper in preparation.

Our method, Copula-based Conformal Anomaly Identification for Multivariate Time-Series (CoCAI), leverages a diffusion-based model to capture complex dependencies within the data, enabling high quality forecasting. The model's outputs are further calibrated using a conformal prediction technique, yielding predictive regions which are statistically valid, i.e., cover the true target values with a desired confidence level. Starting from these calibrated forecasts, robust outlier detection is performed by combining dimensionality reduction techniques with copula-based modeling, providing a statistically grounded anomaly score. CoCAI benefits from an offline calibration phase that allows for minimal overhead during deployment and delivers actionable results rooted in established theoretical foundations. Empirical tests conducted on real operational data derived from water distribution and sewerage systems confirm CoCAI's effectiveness in accurately forecasting target sequences of data and in identifying anomalous segments within them.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Presentation at Runtime Verification 25</p></details> |

However, existing generalist time series foundation models struggle to handle medical time series data due to their inherent challenges, including irregular intervals, heterogeneous sampling rates, and frequent missing values. To address these challenges, we introduce MIRA, a unified foundation model specifically designed for medical time series forecasting. MIRA incorporates a Continuous-Time Rotary Positional Encoding that enables fine-grained modeling of variable time intervals, a frequency-specific mixture-of-experts layer that routes computation across latent frequency regimes to further promote temporal specialization, and a Continuous Dynamics Extrapolation Block based on Neural ODE that models the continuous trajectory of latent states, enabling accurate forecasting at arbitrary target timestamps. Pretrained on a large-scale and diverse medical corpus comprising over 454 billion time points collect from publicly available datasets, MIRA achieves reductions in forecasting errors by an average of 10% and 7% in out-of-distribution and in-distribution scenarios, respectively, when compared to other zero-shot and fine-tuned baselines. We also introduce a comprehensive benchmark spanning multiple downstream clinical tasks, establishing a foundation for future research in medical time series modeling.</p></details> |  |

Accurate maps of weed management methods are essential for policymakers to assess farmer practices, evaluate impacts on vegetation health, biodiversity, and climate, as well as ensure compliance with policies and subsidies. However, monitoring weed management methods is challenging as they commonly rely on ground-based field surveys, which are often costly, time-consuming and subject to delays. In order to tackle this problem, we leverage earth observation data and Machine Learning (ML). Specifically, we developed separate ML models using Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope satellite time series data, respectively, to classify four distinct weed management methods (Mowing, Tillage, Chemical-spraying, and No practice) in orchards. The findings demonstrate the potential of ML-driven remote sensing to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of weed management mapping in orchards.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for 2025 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS 2025)</p></details> |

Existing approaches typically adopt either channel-mixing (CM) or channel-independence (CI) strategies. CM strategy can capture inter-variable dependencies but fails to discern variable-specific temporal patterns. CI strategy improves this aspect but fails to fully exploit cross-variable dependencies like CM. Hybrid strategies based on feature fusion offer limited generalization and interpretability. To address these issues, we propose C3RL, a novel representation learning framework that jointly models both CM and CI strategies. Motivated by contrastive learning in computer vision, C3RL treats the inputs of the two strategies as transposed views and builds a siamese network architecture: one strategy serves as the backbone, while the other complements it. By jointly optimizing contrastive and prediction losses with adaptive weighting, C3RL balances representation and forecasting performance. Extensive experiments on seven models show that C3RL boosts the best-case performance rate to 81.4\% for models based on CI strategy and to 76.3\% for models based on CM strategy, demonstrating strong generalization and effectiveness. The code will be available once the paper is accepted.</p></details> |  |

This study evaluates optical Sentinel-2 satellite imagery for detecting digestate application, a practice that enhances soil fertility but poses environmental risks like microplastic contamination and nitrogen losses. In the first instance, Sentinel-2 satellite image time series (SITS) analysis of specific indices (EOMI, NDVI, EVI) was used to characterize EOM's spectral behavior after application on the soils of four different crop types in Thessaly, Greece. Furthermore, Machine Learning (ML) models (namely Random Forest, k-NN, Gradient Boosting and a Feed-Forward Neural Network), were used to investigate digestate presence detection, achieving F1-scores up to 0.85.

However, its core component, self-attention, has the quadratic time complexity relative to input sequence length, which hinders the scalability of Transformers. The exsiting approaches on optimizing self-attention either discard full-contextual information or lack of flexibility. In this work, we design DistrAttention, an effcient and flexible self-attention mechanism with the full context. DistrAttention achieves this by grouping data on the embedding dimensionality, usually referred to as $d$. We realize DistrAttention with a lightweight sampling and fusion method that exploits locality-sensitive hashing to group similar data. A block-wise grouping framework is further designed to limit the errors introduced by locality sensitive hashing. By optimizing the selection of block sizes, DistrAttention could be easily integrated with FlashAttention-2, gaining high-performance on modern GPUs. We evaluate DistrAttention with extensive experiments. The results show that our method is 37% faster than FlashAttention-2 on calculating self-attention. In ViT inference, DistrAttention is the fastest and the most accurate among approximate self-attention mechanisms. In Llama3-1B, DistrAttention still achieves the lowest inference time with only 1% accuray loss.</p></details> |  |

This pressing issue highlights the need for innovative solutions to mitigate AI's ecological footprint. One of the key factors influencing the energy consumption of ML model training is the size of the training dataset. ML models are often trained on vast amounts of data continuously generated by sensors and devices distributed across multiple locations. To reduce data transmission costs and enhance privacy, Federated Learning (FL) enables model training without the need to move or share raw data. While FL offers these advantages, it also introduces challenges due to the heterogeneity of data sources (related to volume and quality), computational node capabilities, and environmental impact. This paper contributes to the advancement of Green AI by proposing a data-centric approach to Green Federated Learning. Specifically, we focus on reducing FL's environmental impact by minimizing the volume of training data. Our methodology involves the analysis of the characteristics of federated datasets, the selecting of an optimal subset of data based on quality metrics, and the choice of the federated nodes with the lowest environmental impact. We develop a comprehensive methodology that examines the influence of data-centric factors, such as data quality and volume, on FL training performance and carbon emissions. Building on these insights, we introduce an interactive recommendation system that optimizes FL configurations through data reduction, minimizing environmental impact during training. Applying this methodology to time series classification has demonstrated promising results in reducing the environmental impact of FL tasks.</p></details> |  |

In the context of globalization and economic interdependencies, corruption not only affects investment and distorts markets, but it can also, under certain conditions, temporarily boost economic activity. Using data from the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the Corruption Perception Index (CPI), we implement a time-series-based model to capture the interactions between these two variables. Through a coupled vector autoregressive equations system, our model identifies patterns of interdependence between economic fluctuations and perceptions of corruption at a global level. Employing graph theory and Granger causality, we build a network of interconnections that illustrates how corruption dynamics in one country can influence economic growth and corruption perception in others. The results provide a robust tool for analyzing international political-economic relationships and can serve as a basis for designing policies that promote transparency and sustainable development.</p></details> | <details><summary>We de...</summary><p>We decided to withdraw the current version of the manuscript to improve its structure, clarify some arguments, and incorporate additional results.

However, this is often not the case for high-dimensional data, and it can be hard even for domain experts to mathematically specify which features are important. Can we instead automatically extract collections or groups of features that are aligned with expert knowledge? To address this gap, we present FIX (Features Interpretable to eXperts), a benchmark for measuring how well a collection of features aligns with expert knowledge. In collaboration with domain experts, we propose FIXScore, a unified expert alignment measure applicable to diverse real-world settings across cosmology, psychology, and medicine domains in vision, language, and time series data modalities. With FIXScore, we find that popular feature-based explanation methods have poor alignment with expert-specified knowledge, highlighting the need for new methods that can better identify features interpretable to experts.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a unified matrix-order framework that casts convolutional, recurrent and self-attention operations as sparse matrix multiplications. Convolution is realized via an upper-triangular weight matrix performing first-order transformations; recurrence emerges from a lower-triangular matrix encoding stepwise updates; attention arises naturally as a third-order tensor factorization. We prove algebraic isomorphism with standard CNN, RNN and Transformer layers under mild assumptions. Empirical evaluations on image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, Tiny ImageNet), time-series forecasting (ETTh1, Electricity Load Diagrams) and language modeling/classification (AG News, WikiText-2, Penn Treebank) confirm that sparse-matrix formulations match or exceed native model performance while converging in comparable or fewer epochs. By reducing architecture design to sparse pattern selection, our matrix perspective aligns with GPU parallelism and leverages mature algebraic optimization tools. This work establishes a mathematically rigorous substrate for diverse neural architectures and opens avenues for principled, hardware-aware network design.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging techniques from random matrix theory and free probability, we provide sharp asymptotics for the in- and out-of-sample risks of ridge regression when the data points have arbitrary correlations. We demonstrate that in this setting, the generalized cross validation estimator (GCV) fails to correctly predict the out-of-sample risk. However, in the case where the noise residuals have the same correlations as the data points, one can modify the GCV to yield an efficiently-computable unbiased estimator that concentrates in the high-dimensional limit, which we dub CorrGCV. We further extend our asymptotic analysis to the case where the test point has nontrivial correlations with the training set, a setting often encountered in time series forecasting. Assuming knowledge of the correlation structure of the time series, this again yields an extension of the GCV estimator, and sharply characterizes the degree to which such test points yield an overly optimistic prediction of long-time risk. We validate the predictions of our theory across a variety of high dimensional data.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 19 figures. v4: ICML 2025 camera-ready. v5: Fix typo in statement of Theorem 5</p></details> |

However, validating whether discovered clusters represent distinct relationships rather than arbitrary groupings remains a fundamental challenge. Existing clustering validity indices were developed for Euclidean data, and their effectiveness for correlation patterns has not been systematically evaluated. Unlike Euclidean clustering, where geometric shapes provide discrete reference targets, correlations exist in continuous space without equivalent reference patterns. We address this validation gap by introducing canonical correlation patterns as mathematically defined validation targets that discretise the infinite correlation space into finite, interpretable reference patterns. Using synthetic datasets with perfect ground truth across controlled conditions, we demonstrate that canonical patterns provide reliable validation targets, with L1 norm for mapping and L5 norm for silhouette width criterion and Davies-Bouldin index showing superior performance. These methods are robust to distribution shifts and appropriately detect correlation structure degradation, enabling practical implementation guidelines. This work establishes a methodological foundation for rigorous correlation-based clustering validation in high-stakes domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 8 figures.

Despite its significance, IOH prediction is hindered by event sparsity and the challenge of integrating static and dynamic data across diverse patients. In this paper, we propose \textbf{IOHFuseLM}, a multimodal language model framework. To accurately identify and differentiate sparse hypotensive events, we leverage a two-stage training strategy. The first stage involves domain adaptive pretraining on IOH physiological time series augmented through diffusion methods, thereby enhancing the model sensitivity to patterns associated with hypotension. Subsequently, task fine-tuning is performed on the original clinical dataset to further enhance the ability to distinguish normotensive from hypotensive states. To enable multimodal fusion for each patient, we align structured clinical descriptions with the corresponding physiological time series at the token level. Such alignment enables the model to capture individualized temporal patterns alongside their corresponding clinical semantics. In addition, we convert static patient attributes into structured text to enrich personalized information. Experimental evaluations on two intraoperative datasets demonstrate that IOHFuseLM outperforms established baselines in accurately identifying IOH events, highlighting its applicability in clinical decision support scenarios.

Consequently, the detection and localization of these interference signals are essential to achieve situational awareness, mitigating their impact, and implementing effective counter-measures. Classical Angle of Arrival (AoA) methods exhibit reduced accuracy in multipath environments due to signal reflections and scattering, leading to localization errors. Additionally, AoA-based techniques demand substantial computational resources for array signal processing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for detecting and classifying interference while estimating the distance, azimuth, and elevation of jamming sources. Our benchmark study evaluates 128 vision encoder and time-series models to identify the highest-performing methods for each task. We introduce an attention-based fusion framework that integrates in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-computed spectrograms while incorporating 22 AoA features to enhance localization accuracy. Furthermore, we present a novel dataset of moving jamming devices recorded in an indoor environment with dynamic multipath conditions and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 6 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Density Prediction of Income Distribution Based on Mixed Frequency Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16150v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling large dependent datasets in modern time series analysis is a crucial research area. One effective approach to handle such datasets is to transform the observations into density functions and apply statistical methods for further analysis. Income distribution forecasting, a common application scenario, benefits from predicting density functions as it accounts for uncertainty around point estimates, leading to more informed policy formulation. However, predictive modeling becomes challenging when dealing with mixed-frequency data. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a mixed data sampling regression model for probability density functions (PDF-MIDAS). To mitigate variance inflation caused by high-frequency prediction variables, we utilize exponential Almon polynomials with fewer parameters to regularize the coefficient structure. Additionally, we propose an iterative estimation method based on quadratic programming and the BFGS algorithm. Simulation analyses demonstrate that as the sample size for estimating density functions and observation length increase, the estimator approaches the true value. Real data analysis reveals that compared to single-sequence prediction models, PDF-MIDAS incorporating high-frequency exogenous variables offers a wider range of application scenarios with superior fitting and prediction performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpiroLLM: Finetuning Pretrained LLMs to Understand Spirogram Time Series with Clinical Validation in COPD Reporting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16145v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a major chronic respiratory disease with persistent airflow limitation, is a leading global cause of disability and mortality. Respiratory spirogram time series, routinely collected during pulmonary function tests (PFTs), play a critical role in the early detection of repsiratory diseases and in monitoring lung function over time. However, most current AI models for COPD diagnosis are limited to outputting classification results without providing a rationale for their diagnostic process, while current Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot understand spirograms yet, which severely limits their clinical trust and adoption. To tackle this challenge, we leverage a cohort of 234,028 individuals from the UK Biobank (UKB) to propose SpiroLLM, the first multimodal large language model that can understand spirogram. The model extracts morphological features from respiratory curves via a SpiroEncoder and aligns them with PFT numerical values in a unified latent space using a SpiroProjector, ultimately empowering a large language model to generate a comprehensive diagnostic report. Experimental results confirm that SpiroLLM achieved a diagnostic AUROC of 0.8980 (95% CI: 0.8820-0.9132). In a robustness test with missing core data, it maintained a 100% valid response rate, far surpassing the 13.4% of a text-only model and showcasing the superiority of its multimodal design. This work demonstrates the substantial potential of deeply fusing physiological signals with large language models, establishing a new paradigm for the next generation of interpretable and reliable clinical decision support tools.</p></details> |  |

We develop a hybrid reduced order model (ROM), informed by both data and FOM, for evolving spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics on an invariant manifold whose coordinates are found using an autoencoder. This approach projects the vector field of the FOM onto the invariant manifold; then, this physics-derived vector field is either corrected using dynamic data, or used as a Bayesian prior that is updated with data. In both cases, the neural ordinary differential equation approach is used. We consider simulated data from the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and complex Ginzburg-Landau equations. Relative to the data-only approach, for scenarios of abundant data, scarce data, and even an incorrect FOM (i.e. erroneous parameter values), the hybrid approach yields substantially improved time-series predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predictive inference for discrete-valued time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16035v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For discrete-valued time series, predictive inference cannot be implemented through the construction of prediction intervals to some predetermined coverage level, as this is the case for real-valued time series. To address this problem, we propose to reverse the construction principle by considering preselected sets of interest and estimating the probability that a future observation of the process falls into these sets. The accuracy of the prediction is then evaluated by quantifying the uncertainty associated with estimation of these predictive probabilities. We consider parametric and non-parametric approaches and derive asymptotic theory for the estimators involved. Suitable bootstrap approaches to evaluate the distribution of the estimators considered also are introduced. They have the advantage to imitate the distributions of interest under different possible settings, including the practical important case where uncertainty holds true about the correctness of a parametric model used for prediction. Theoretical justification of the bootstrap is given, which also requires investigation of asymptotic properties of parameter estimators under model misspecification. We elaborate on bootstrap implementations under different scenarios and focus on parametric prediction using INAR and INARCH models and (conditional) maximum likelihood estimators. Simulations investigate the finite sample performance of the predictive method developed and applications to real life data sets are presented.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 2 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Often, it is of interest to study how these networks change under different conditions. For instance, to better understand epilepsy, it would be interesting to capture the changes in the brain connectivity network as a patient experiences a seizure, using electroencephalography data. A common approach relies on estimating the networks in each condition and calculating their difference. Such estimates may behave poorly in high dimensions as the networks themselves may not be sparse in structure while their difference may be. We build upon this observation to develop an estimator of the difference in inverse spectral densities across two conditions. Using an L1 penalty on the difference, consistency is established by only requiring the difference to be sparse. We illustrate the method on synthetic data experiments and on experiments with electroencephalography data.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 13 figures, AISTATS 2025</p></details> |

Autonomous driving technologies have emerged as a potential solution. Among traffic control methods, reinforcement learning has shown superior performance over traffic signals in various scenarios. However, prior research has largely focused on small-scale networks or isolated intersections, leaving large-scale mixed traffic control largely unexplored. This study presents the first attempt to use decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning for large-scale mixed traffic control in which some intersections are managed by traffic signals and others by robot vehicles. Evaluating a real-world network in Colorado Springs, CO, USA with 14 intersections, we measure traffic efficiency via average waiting time of vehicles at intersections and the number of vehicles reaching their destinations within a time window (i.e., throughput). At 80% RV penetration rate, our method reduces waiting time from 6.17s to 5.09s and increases throughput from 454 vehicles per 500 seconds to 493 vehicles per 500 seconds, outperforming the baseline of fully signalized intersections. These findings suggest that integrating reinforcement learning-based control large-scale traffic can improve overall efficiency and may inform future urban planning strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2025</p></details> |

| **[LAVA: Language Driven Scalable and Versatile Traffic Video Analytics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19821v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern urban environments, camera networks generate massive amounts of operational footage -- reaching petabytes each day -- making scalable video analytics essential for efficient processing. Many existing approaches adopt an SQL-based paradigm for querying such large-scale video databases; however, this constrains queries to rigid patterns with predefined semantic categories, significantly limiting analytical flexibility. In this work, we explore a language-driven video analytics paradigm aimed at enabling flexible and efficient querying of high-volume video data driven by natural language. Particularly, we build \textsc{Lava}, a system that accepts natural language queries and retrieves traffic targets across multiple levels of granularity and arbitrary categories. \textsc{Lava} comprises three main components: 1) a multi-armed bandit-based efficient sampling method for video segment-level localization; 2) a video-specific open-world detection module for object-level retrieval; and 3) a long-term object trajectory extraction scheme for temporal object association, yielding complete trajectories for object-of-interests. To support comprehensive evaluation, we further develop a novel benchmark by providing diverse, semantically rich natural language predicates and fine-grained annotations for multiple videos. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that \textsc{Lava} improves $F_1$-scores for selection queries by $\mathbf{14\%}$, reduces MPAE for aggregation queries by $\mathbf{0.39}$, and achieves top-$k$ precision of $\mathbf{86\%}$, while processing videos $ \mathbf{9.6\times} $ faster than the most accurate baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wardropian Cycles make traffic assignment both optimal and fair by eliminating price-of-anarchy with Cyclical User Equilibrium for compliant connected autonomous vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19675v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) open the possibility for centralised routing with full compliance, making System Optimal traffic assignment attainable. However, as System Optimum makes some drivers better off than others, voluntary acceptance seems dubious. To overcome this issue, we propose a new concept of Wardropian cycles, which, in contrast to previous utopian visions, makes the assignment fair on top of being optimal, which amounts to satisfaction of both Wardrop's principles. Such cycles, represented as sequences of permutations to the daily assignment matrices, always exist and equalise, after a limited number of days, average travel times among travellers (like in User Equilibrium) while preserving everyday optimality of path flows (like in System Optimum). We propose exact methods to compute such cycles and reduce their length and within-cycle inconvenience to the users. As identification of optimal cycles turns out to be NP-hard in many aspects, we introduce a greedy heuristic efficiently approximating the optimal solution. Finally, we introduce and discuss a new paradigm of Cyclical User Equilibrium, which ensures stability of optimal Wardropian Cycles under unilateral deviations. We complement our theoretical study with large-scale simulations. In Barcelona, 670 vehicle-hours of Price-of-Anarchy are eliminated using cycles with a median length of 11 days-though 5% of cycles exceed 90 days. However, in Berlin, just five days of applying the greedy assignment rule significantly reduces initial inequity. In Barcelona, Anaheim, and Sioux Falls, less than 7% of the initial inequity remains after 10 days, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach in improving traffic performance with more ubiquitous social acceptability.</p></details> |  |

Recent LiDAR scene flow models utilize the rigid-motion assumption at the instance level, assuming objects are rigid bodies. However, these instance-level methods are not suitable for sparse radar point clouds. In this work, we present a novel Traffic-Aware Radar Scene-Flow (TARS) estimation method, which utilizes motion rigidity at the traffic level. To address the challenges in radar scene flow, we perform object detection and scene flow jointly and boost the latter. We incorporate the feature map from the object detector, trained with detection losses, to make radar scene flow aware of the environment and road users. From this, we construct a Traffic Vector Field (TVF) in the feature space to achieve holistic traffic-level scene understanding in our scene flow branch. When estimating the scene flow, we consider both point-level motion cues from point neighbors and traffic-level consistency of rigid motion within the space. TARS outperforms the state of the art on a proprietary dataset and the View-of-Delft dataset, improving the benchmarks by 23% and 15%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task, which aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using limited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task. This framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the Lane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies and distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained lane traffic states. Based on existing research, we designed several baseline models with the potential to solve the FRTI task and conducted extensive experiments on six datasets representing different road conditions to validate the effectiveness of the RoadDiff model in addressing the FRTI task. The relevant datasets and code are available at https://github.com/ShuhaoLii/RoadDiff.</p></details> |  |

The literature has effectively tackled such a problem, mostly with automated planning techniques leveraging the PDDL+ language and solvers. However, such language has limitations when it comes to specifying optimisation statements and computing optimal plans. In this paper, we provide an alternative solution to the traffic signal optimisation problem based on Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP). We devise an encoding in a CASP language, which is then solved by means of clingcon 3, a system extending the well-known ASP solver clingo. We performed experiments on real historical data from the town of Huddersfield in the UK, comparing our approach to the PDDL+ model that obtained the best results for the considered benchmark. The results showed the potential of our approach for tackling the traffic signal optimisation problem and improving the solution quality of the PDDL+ plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP), Proceedings of ICLP 2025</p></details> |

Current approaches often hinge on predefined driver models, objective optimization, or reliance on pre-recorded driving datasets, imposing limitations on their scalability, versatility, and adaptability. In this paper, we introduce TrafficMCTS, an innovative framework that harnesses the synergy of group-based Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and Social Value Orientation (SVO) to engender a multifaceted traffic flow with varying driving styles and cooperative tendencies. Anchored by a closed-loop architecture, our framework enables vehicles to dynamically adapt to their environment in real time, and ensure feasible collision-free trajectories. Through comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, we illuminate the advantages of our approach in terms of computational efficiency, planning success rate, intention completion time, and diversity metrics. Besides, we simulate multiple scenarios to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and highlight its ability to induce diverse social behaviors within the traffic flow. Finally, we validate the scalability of TrafficMCTS by demonstrating its capability to efficiently simulate diverse traffic scenarios involving numerous interacting vehicles within a complex road network, capturing the intricate dynamics of human-like driving behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> |

This includes value elicitation, capability specification, explanation, and adaptive system refinement.

While the abundance of data has fueled significant breakthroughs, particularly in machine learning-based methods, it also raises concerns regarding privacy, cybersecurity, and data freshness. These issues can erode public trust in intelligent transportation systems. Recently, regulations have introduced the "right to be forgotten", allowing users to request the removal of their private data from models. As machine learning models can remember old data, simply removing it from back-end databases is insufficient in such systems. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel learning paradigm for TSEP-Machine Unlearning TSEP-which enables a trained TSEP model to selectively forget privacy-sensitive, poisoned, or outdated data. By empowering models to "unlearn," we aim to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of data-driven traffic TSEP.</p></details> |  |
| **[LSDM: LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model for Service-Level Mobile Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17795v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Service-level mobile traffic prediction for individual users is essential for network efficiency and quality of service enhancement. However, current prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model (LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions, showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in terms of the coefficient of determination. Compared to models of a similar type, such as CSDI, the root mean squared error can be reduced by at least 8.29%.

| **[Cross-domain Multi-step Thinking: Zero-shot Fine-grained Traffic Sign Recognition in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01534v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we propose Cross-domain Multi-step Thinking (CdMT) to improve zero-shot fine-grained traffic sign recognition (TSR) performance in the wild. Zero-shot fine-grained TSR in the wild is challenging due to the cross-domain problem between clean template traffic signs and real-world counterparts, and existing approaches particularly struggle with cross-country TSR scenarios, where traffic signs typically differ between countries. The proposed CdMT framework tackles these challenges by leveraging the multi-step reasoning capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs). We introduce context, characteristic, and differential descriptions to design multiple thinking processes for LMMs. Context descriptions, which are enhanced by center coordinate prompt optimization, enable the precise localization of target traffic signs in complex road images and filter irrelevant responses via novel prior traffic sign hypotheses. Characteristic descriptions, which are derived from in-context learning with template traffic signs, bridge cross-domain gaps and enhance fine-grained TSR. Differential descriptions refine the multimodal reasoning ability of LMMs by distinguishing subtle differences among similar signs. CdMT is independent of training data and requires only simple and uniform instructions, enabling it to achieve cross-country TSR. We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and two real-world datasets from different countries. The proposed CdMT framework achieved superior performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods on all five datasets, with recognition accuracies of 0.93, 0.89, 0.97, 0.89, and 0.85 on the GTSRB, BTSD, TT-100K, Sapporo, and Yokohama datasets, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published by Knowledge-Based Systems</p></details> |

While existing RL-based methods demonstrate effectiveness in reducing vehicular congestion, their predominant focus on vehicle-centric optimization leaves pedestrian mobility needs and safety challenges unaddressed. In this paper, we present a deep RL framework for adaptive control of eight traffic signals along a real-world urban corridor, jointly optimizing both pedestrian and vehicular efficiency. Our single-agent policy is trained using real-world pedestrian and vehicle demand data derived from Wi-Fi logs and video analysis. The results demonstrate significant performance improvements over traditional fixed-time signals, reducing average wait times per pedestrian and per vehicle by up to 67% and 52% respectively, while simultaneously decreasing total wait times for both groups by up to 67% and 53%. Additionally, our results demonstrate generalization capabilities across varying traffic demands, including conditions entirely unseen during training, validating RL's potential for developing transportation systems that serve all road users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2025</p></details> |

All of them promise astonishing performance in encrypted traffic classification (up to 98% accuracy). In this paper, with a networking expert mindset, we critically reassess their performance. Through extensive analysis, we demonstrate that the reported successes are heavily influenced by data preparation problems, which allow these models to find easy shortcuts - spurious correlation between features and labels - during fine-tuning that unrealistically boost their performance. When such shortcuts are not present - as in real scenarios - these models perform poorly. We also introduce Pcap-Encoder, an LM-based representation learning model that we specifically design to extract features from protocol headers. Pcap-Encoder appears to be the only model that provides an instrumental representation for traffic classification. Yet, its complexity questions its applicability in practical settings. Our findings reveal flaws in dataset preparation and model training, calling for a better and more conscious test design. We propose a correct evaluation methodology and stress the need for rigorous benchmarking.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at ACM SIGCOMM 2025.

To address this growing concern, we introduce Beacon, a naturalistic driving dataset capturing traffic dynamics during blackouts at two major intersections in Memphis, TN, USA. The dataset provides detailed traffic movements, including timesteps, origin, and destination lanes for each vehicle over four hours of peak periods. We analyze traffic demand, vehicle trajectories, and density across different scenarios, demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction under unsignalized, signalized, and mixed traffic conditions. We find that integrating robot vehicles (RVs) into traffic flow can substantially reduce intersection delays, with wait time improvements of up to 82.6%. However, this enhanced traffic efficiency comes with varying environmental impacts, as decreased vehicle idling may lead to higher overall CO2 emissions.

| **[Heterogeneous Mixed Traffic Control and Coordination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12330v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban intersections with diverse vehicle types, from small cars to large semi-trailers, pose significant challenges for traffic control. This study explores how robot vehicles (RVs) can enhance heterogeneous traffic flow, particularly at unsignalized intersections where traditional methods fail during power outages. Using reinforcement learning (RL) and real-world data, we simulate mixed traffic at complex intersections with RV penetration rates ranging from 10% to 90%. Results show that average waiting times drop by up to 86% and 91% compared to signalized and unsignalized intersections, respectively. We observe a "rarity advantage," where less frequent vehicles benefit the most (up to 87%). Although CO2 emissions and fuel consumption increase with RV penetration, they remain well below those of traditional signalized traffic. Decreased space headways also indicate more efficient road usage. These findings highlight RVs' potential to improve traffic efficiency and reduce environmental impact in complex, heterogeneous settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2025</p></details> |

This study addresses binary VPN detection, distinguishing VPN-encrypted from non-VPN traffic using wavelet transform-based features across multiple machine learning models. Unlike previous studies focused on application-level classification within encrypted traffic, we specifically evaluate the fundamental task of VPN identification regardless of application type. We analyze the impact of wavelet decomposition levels and dataset filtering on classification performance across significantly imbalanced data, where filtering reduces some traffic categories by up to 95%. Our results demonstrate that Random Forest (RF) achieves superior performance with an F1-score of 99%, maintaining robust accuracy even after significant dataset filtering. Neural Networks (NN) show comparable effectiveness with an F1-score of 98% when trained on wavelet level 12, while Support Vector Machines (SVM) exhibit notable sensitivity to dataset reduction, with F1-scores dropping from 90% to 85% after filtering. Comparing wavelet decomposition at levels 5 and 12, we observe improved classification performance at level 12, particularly for variable traffic types, though the marginal gains may not justify the additional computational overhead. These findings establish RF as the most reliable model for VPN traffic classification while highlighting key performance tradeoffs in feature extraction and preprocessing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at SoftCOM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Variational Mode-Driven Graph Convolutional Network for Spatiotemporal Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16191v3)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on spatiotemporal (ST) traffic prediction using graph neural networks (GNNs). Given that ST data comprises non-stationary and complex temporal patterns, interpreting and predicting such trends is inherently challenging. Representing ST data in decomposed modes helps infer underlying behavior and assess the impact of noise on predictive performance. We propose a framework that decomposes ST data into interpretable modes using variational mode decomposition (VMD) and processes them through a neural network for future state forecasting. Unlike existing graph-based traffic forecasters that operate directly on raw or aggregated time series, the proposed hybrid approach, termed the Variational Mode Graph Convolutional Network (VMGCN), first decomposes non-stationary signals into interpretable variational modes by determining the optimal mode count via reconstruction-loss minimization and then learns both intramode and cross-mode spatiotemporal dependencies through a novel attention-augmented GCN. Additionally, we analyze the significance of each mode and the effect of bandwidth constraints on multi-horizon traffic flow predictions. The proposed two-stage design yields significant accuracy gains while providing frequency-level interpretability with demonstrated superior performance on the LargeST dataset for both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks. The implementation is publicly available on https://github.com/OsamaAhmad369/VMGCN.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM T...</summary><p>ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST) Submission, 2025</p></details> |

Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers an adaptive method for TSC by responding to dynamic traffic patterns, with multi-agent RL (MARL) gaining traction as intersections naturally function as coordinated agents. However, due to shifts in environmental dynamics, implementing MARL-based TSC policies in the real world often leads to a significant performance drop, known as the sim-to-real gap. Grounded Action Transformation (GAT) has successfully mitigated this gap in single-agent RL for TSC, but real-world traffic networks, which involve numerous interacting intersections, are better suited to a MARL framework. In this work, we introduce JL-GAT, an application of GAT to MARL-based TSC that balances scalability with enhanced grounding capability by incorporating information from neighboring agents. JL-GAT adopts a decentralized approach to GAT, allowing for the scalability often required in real-world traffic networks while still capturing key interactions between agents. Comprehensive experiments on various road networks under simulated adverse weather conditions, along with ablation studies, demonstrate the effectiveness of JL-GAT. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/DaRL-LibSignal/JL-GAT/.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted to RLC/RLJ 2025</p></details> |

With the cellular traffic demand increasing so dramatically, it is now necessary to accurately predict the user traffic in cellular networks, so as to improve the performance in terms of resource allocation and utilisation. Since traffic learning and prediction is a classical and appealing field, which still yields many meaningful results, there has been an increasing interest in leveraging Machine Learning tools to analyse the total traffic served in a given region, to optimise the operation of the network. With the help of this project, we seek to exploit the traffic history by using it to predict the nature and occurrence of future traffic. Furthermore, we classify the traffic into particular application types, to increase our understanding of the nature of the traffic. By leveraging the power of machine learning and identifying its usefulness in the field of cellular networks we try to achieve three main objectives - classification of the application generating the traffic, prediction of packet arrival intensity and burst occurrence. The design of the prediction and classification system is done using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model. The LSTM predictor developed in this experiment would return the number of uplink packets and also estimate the probability of burst occurrence in the specified future time interval. For the purpose of classification, the regression layer in our LSTM prediction model is replaced by a softmax classifier which is used to classify the application generating the cellular traffic into one of the four applications including surfing, video calling, voice calling, and video streaming.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |

Recent empirical approaches for analyzing traffic patterns have gained traction due to their applicability to city-scale policy development. However, conventional methodologies often rely on fragmented grid-based techniques, which may overlook critical interdependencies among spatial elements and temporal continuity. These limitations can compromise analytical effectiveness in complex urban environments. To address these challenges, we propose PriorMotion, a data integration framework designed to systematically uncover movement patterns through driving dynamics analysis. Our approach combines multi-scale empirical observations with customized analytical tools to capture evolving spatial-temporal trends in urban traffic. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PriorMotion significantly enhances analytical outcomes, including increased accuracy in traffic pattern analysis, improved adaptability to heterogeneous data environments, and reduced long-term projection errors. Validation confirms its effectiveness for urban infrastructure management applications requiring precise characterization of complex spatial-temporal interactions.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

Deep learning has advanced video-based traffic monitoring through video question answering (VideoQA) models, enabling structured insight extraction from traffic videos. However, existing VideoQA models struggle with the complexity of real-world traffic scenes, where multiple concurrent events unfold across spatiotemporal dimensions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \textbf{InterAct VideoQA}, a curated dataset designed to benchmark and enhance VideoQA models for traffic monitoring tasks. The InterAct VideoQA dataset comprises 8 hours of real-world traffic footage collected from diverse intersections, segmented into 10-second video clips, with over 25,000 question-answer (QA) pairs covering spatiotemporal dynamics, vehicle interactions, incident detection, and other critical traffic attributes. State-of-the-art VideoQA models are evaluated on InterAct VideoQA, exposing challenges in reasoning over fine-grained spatiotemporal dependencies within complex traffic scenarios. Additionally, fine-tuning these models on InterAct VideoQA yields notable performance improvements, demonstrating the necessity of domain-specific datasets for VideoQA. InterAct VideoQA is publicly available as a benchmark dataset to facilitate future research in real-world deployable VideoQA models for intelligent transportation systems.

This paper proposes Fourier Domain Adaptation (FDA), which requires only training data modifications without architectural changes, enabling effective adaptation to rainy and foggy conditions. FDA minimizes the domain gap between source and target domains, creating a dataset for reliable performance under adverse weather. The source domain merged LISA and S2TLD datasets, processed to address class imbalance. Established methods simulated rainy and foggy scenarios to form the target domain. Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) techniques were explored to leverage data more effectively, addressing the shortage of comprehensive datasets and poor performance of state-of-the-art models under hostile weather. Experimental results show FDA-augmented models outperform baseline models across mAP50, mAP50-95, Precision, and Recall metrics. YOLOv8 achieved a 12.25% average increase across all metrics. Average improvements of 7.69% in Precision, 19.91% in Recall, 15.85% in mAP50, and 23.81% in mAP50-95 were observed across all models, demonstrating FDA's effectiveness in mitigating adverse weather impact.

However, the traditional methods rely on standard graph structures often fail to capture the intricate higher-order spatio-temporal correlations inherent in real-world traffic dynamics. Standard graphs cannot fully represent the spatial relationships within road networks, which limits the effectiveness of graph-based approaches. In contrast, directed hypergraphs provide more accurate representation of spatial information to model complex directed relationships among multiple nodes. In this paper, we propose DHLight, a novel multi-agent policy-based framework that synergistically integrates directed hypergraph learning module. This framework introduces a novel dynamic directed hypergraph construction mechanism, which captures complex and evolving spatio-temporal relationships among intersections in road networks. By leveraging the directed hypergraph relational structure, DHLight empowers agents to achieve adaptive decision-making in traffic signal control. The effectiveness of DHLight is validated against state-of-the-art baselines through extensive experiments in various network datasets.

Relying solely on real-world driving scenes requires collecting massive datasets to capture these scenarios. While automatic generation of traffic scenarios appears promising, data-driven models require extensive training data and often lack fine-grained control over the output. Moreover, generating novel scenarios from scratch can introduce a distributional shift from the original training scenes which undermines the validity of evaluations especially for learning-based planners. To sidestep this, recent work proposes to generate challenging scenarios by augmenting original scenarios from the test set. However, this involves the manual augmentation of scenarios by domain experts. An approach that is unable to meet the demands for scale in the evaluation of self-driving systems. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel LLM-agent based framework for augmenting real-world traffic scenarios using natural language descriptions, addressing the limitations of existing methods. A key innovation is the use of an agentic design, enabling fine-grained control over the output and maintaining high performance even with smaller, cost-effective LLMs. Extensive human expert evaluation demonstrates our framework's ability to accurately adhere to user intent, generating high quality augmented scenarios comparable to those created manually.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional AI approaches often fail to capture the intricate spatial and temporal patterns that exist, due to e.g., the mobility of users. We introduce a lightweight, dual-path Spatiotemporal Network that leverages a Scalar LSTM (sLSTM) for efficient temporal modeling and a three-layer Conv3D module for spatial feature extraction. A fusion layer integrates both streams into a cohesive representation, enabling robust forecasting. Our design improves gradient stability and convergence speed while reducing prediction error. Evaluations on real-world datasets show superior forecast performance over ConvLSTM baselines and strong generalization to unseen regions, making it well-suited for large-scale, next-generation network deployments. Experimental evaluation shows a 23% MAE reduction over ConvLSTM, with a 30% improvement in model generalization.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we propose GraphTrafficGPT, a novel graph-based architecture, which fundamentally redesigns the task coordination process for LLM-driven traffic applications. GraphTrafficGPT represents tasks and their dependencies as nodes and edges in a directed graph, enabling efficient parallel execution and dynamic resource allocation. The main idea behind the proposed model is a Brain Agent that decomposes user queries, constructs optimized dependency graphs, and coordinates a network of specialized agents for data retrieval, analysis, visualization, and simulation. By introducing advanced context-aware token management and supporting concurrent multi-query processing, the proposed architecture handles interdependent tasks typical of modern urban mobility environments. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphTrafficGPT reduces token consumption by 50.2% and average response latency by 19.0% compared to TrafficGPT, while supporting simultaneous multi-query execution with up to 23.0% improvement in efficiency.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces an interpretable Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework to address this gap. Our attention-based model predicts the number of upcoming clearances, the instructions issued to aircraft by ATCOs, from interactions within static traffic scenarios. Crucially, we derive an interpretable, per-aircraft task demand score by systematically ablating aircraft and measuring the impact on the model's predictions. Our framework significantly outperforms an ATCO-inspired heuristic and is a more reliable estimator of scenario complexity than established baselines. The resulting tool can attribute task demand to specific aircraft, offering a new way to analyse and understand the drivers of complexity for applications in controller training and airspace redesign.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Author Accepted Manuscript version of paper at the AIAA AVIATION Forum 2025</p></details> |

The research utilized 30-second interval traffic data from California Highway 78 over a five-month period from July to November 2022, analyzing a 7.24 km westbound section connecting "Melrose Dr" and "El-Camino Real" in the San Diego area. The study employed Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms, analyzing data collection intervals ranging from 30 seconds to 15 minutes. Using R^2, MAE, and RMSE as performance metrics, the analysis revealed that both MLR and RF models performed optimally with 10-minute data collection intervals. These findings are expected to contribute to future traffic congestion solutions and efficient traffic management.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, methods such as manual counting, loop detectors, pneumatic road tubes, and camera-based recognition have been used for TMC estimation. Although generally reliable, camera-based TMC estimation is prone to inaccuracies under poor lighting conditions during harsh weather and nighttime. In contrast, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology is gaining popularity in recent times due to reduced costs and its expanding use in 3D object detection, tracking, and related applications. This paper presents the authors' endeavor to develop, deploy and evaluate a dual-LiDAR system at an intersection in the city of Rialto, California, for TMC estimation. The 3D bounding box detections from the two LiDARs are used to classify vehicle counts based on traffic directions, vehicle movements, and vehicle classes. This work discusses the estimated TMC results and provides insights into the observed trends and irregularities. Potential improvements are also discussed that could enhance not only TMC estimation, but also trajectory forecasting and intent prediction at intersections.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 Pag...</summary><p>7 Pages, 8 Figures.

Apart from variation across different content types, e.g., game genres, we discovered time-variability within a clip from second to second, and explored the ramifications for traffic management. We introduced utility as an elegant way to manage resource sharing preferences. Our analysis of resource sharing methods shows that frequent QoE-aware reallocation has significant performance advantages compared to static rate allocation, even in case the latter is based on rich information about long-term average spatial complexity. We have also shown that utility-based resource allocation has clear advantages over methods targeting equal QoE allocation, it increases the average QoE, while it still controls the worst case QoE.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, the ability to anticipate the timing of leaf-fall would offer substantial benefits for rail network operators, enabling the efficient scheduling of such mitigation measures. However, current methodologies for predicting leaf-fall exhibit considerable limitations in terms of scalability and reliability. This study endeavors to devise a prediction system that leverages specialized prediction methods and the latest satellite data sources to generate both scalable and reliable insights into leaf-fall timings. An LSTM network trained on ground-truth leaf-falling data combined with multispectral and meteorological satellite data demonstrated a root-mean-square error of 6.32 days for predicting the start of leaf-fall and 9.31 days for predicting the end of leaf-fall. The model, which improves upon previous work on the topic, offers promising opportunities for the optimization of leaf mitigation measures in the railway industry and the improvement of our understanding of complex ecological systems.</p></details> |  |

Currently, a cooperative control strategy based on connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is a fundamental solution to this problem. While CAVs are not fully widespread, it is necessary to propose a hierarchical cooperative on-ramp merging control (HCOMC) framework for heterogeneous traffic flow on two-lane highways to address this gap. This paper extends longitudinal car-following models based on the intelligent driver model and lateral lane-changing models using the quintic polynomial curve to account for human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs, comprehensively considering human factors and cooperative adaptive cruise control. Besides, this paper proposes a HCOMC framework, consisting of a hierarchical cooperative planning model based on the modified virtual vehicle model, a discretionary lane-changing model based on game theory, and a multi-objective optimization model using the elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to ensure the safe, smooth, and efficient merging process. Then, the performance of our HCOMC is analyzed under different traffic densities and CAV penetration rates through simulation. The findings underscore our HCOMC's pronounced comprehensive advantages in enhancing the safety of group vehicles, stabilizing and expediting merging process, optimizing traffic efficiency, and economizing fuel consumption compared with benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, accepted for IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC) 2025</p></details> |

Existing acceleration strategies, which rely on commercial solvers or deep learning, face scalability issues and struggle with degrading performance or long computational time. Unlike existing algorithms adopting parallel strategies, we propose Sequential Source-Destination Optimization (SSDO), a sequential solver-free algorithm for TE. SSDO decomposes the problem into subproblems, each focused on adjusting the split ratios for a specific source-destination (SD) demand while keeping others fixed. To enhance the efficiency of subproblem optimization, we design a Balanced Binary Search Method (BBSM), which identifies the most balanced split ratios among multiple solutions that minimize Maximum Link Utilization (MLU). SSDO dynamically updates the sequence of SDs based on real-time utilization, which accelerates convergence and enhances solution quality. We evaluate SSDO on Meta DCNs and two wide-area networks. In a Meta topology, SSDO achieves a 65\% and 60\% reduction in normalized MLU compared to TEAL and POP, two state-of-the-art TE acceleration methods, while delivering a $12\times$ speedup over POP. These results demonstrate the superior performance of SSDO in large-scale TE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 23rd USENIX Symposium on Network Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI '26), to be held in Seattle on May 4-6, 2026</p></details> |

The models particularly are based on GraphSAGE, Bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) as well as Multi-Head Attention, together with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BI-LSTM) Multi-Head Attention and BI-LSTM and LSTM models. The chosen models demonstrated great performance to model temporal patterns and detect feature significance. The observed performance are mainly due to the fact that IoT system traffic patterns are both sequential and diverse, leaving a rich set of temporal patterns for the models to learn. Experimental results showed that BERT maintained the best performance. It achieved 99.94% accuracy rate alongside high precision and recall, F1-score and AUC-ROC score of 99.99% which demonstrates its capabilities through temporal dependency capture. The Multi-Head Attention offered promising results by providing good detection capabilities with interpretable results. On the other side, the Multi-Head Attention model required significant processing time like BI-LSTM variants. The GraphSAGE model achieved good accuracy while requiring the shortest training time but yielded the lowest accuracy, precision, and F1 score compared to the other models</p></details> |  |

However, most existing lane-changing frameworks overlook HVs' dynamic trust levels, limiting their ability to accurately predict human driver behaviors. To address this gap, this study proposes a trust-aware game-theoretic lane-changing decision (TGLD) framework. First, we formulate a multi-vehicle coalition game, incorporating fully cooperative interactions among AVs and partially cooperative behaviors from HVs informed by real-time trust evaluations. Second, we develop an online trust evaluation method to dynamically estimate HVs' trust levels during lane-changing interactions, guiding AVs to select context-appropriate cooperative maneuvers. Lastly, social compatibility objectives are considered by minimizing disruption to surrounding vehicles and enhancing the predictability of AV behaviors, thereby ensuring human-friendly and context-adaptive lane-changing strategies. A human-in-the-loop experiment conducted in a highway on-ramp merging scenario validates our TGLD approach. Results show that AVs can effectively adjust strategies according to different HVs' trust levels and driving styles. Moreover, incorporating a trust mechanism significantly improves lane-changing efficiency, maintains safety, and contributes to transparent and adaptive AV-HV interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures, accepted for IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC) 2025</p></details> |

However, acquiring ground-truth SPaT information faces significant hurdles due to communication challenges with transportation departments and signal installers. As a result, Floating Car Data (FCD) has become the primary source for large-scale SPaT analyses. Current FCD approaches often simplify the problem by assuming fixed schedules and basic intersection designs for specific times and locations. These methods fail to account for periodic signal changes, diverse intersection structures, and the inherent limitations of real-world data, thus lacking a comprehensive framework that is universally applicable. Addressing this limitation, we propose an industrial-grade FCD analysis suite that manages the entire process, from initial data preprocessing to final SPaT estimation. Our approach estimates signal phases, identifies time-of-day (TOD) periods, and determines the durations of red and green lights. The framework's notable stability and robustness across diverse conditions, regardless of road geometry, is a key feature. Furthermore, we provide a cleaned, de-identified FCD dataset and supporting parameters to facilitate future research. Currently operational within our navigation platform, the system analyses over 15 million FCD records daily, supporting over two million traffic signals in mainland China, with more than 75\% of estimations demonstrating less than five seconds of error.</p></details> | Accepted by ITSC'25 |
| **[Federated Learning with Graph-Based Aggregation for Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09805v1)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In traffic prediction, the goal is to estimate traffic speed or flow in specific regions or road segments using historical data collected by devices deployed in each area. Each region or road segment can be viewed as an individual client that measures local traffic flow, making Federated Learning (FL) a suitable approach for collaboratively training models without sharing raw data. In centralized FL, a central server collects and aggregates model updates from multiple clients to build a shared model while preserving each client's data privacy. Standard FL methods, such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg), assume that clients are independent, which can limit performance in traffic prediction tasks where spatial relationships between clients are important. Federated Graph Learning methods can capture these dependencies during server-side aggregation, but they often introduce significant computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a lightweight graph-aware FL approach that blends the simplicity of FedAvg with key ideas from graph learning. Rather than training full models, our method applies basic neighbourhood aggregation principles to guide parameter updates, weighting client models based on graph connectivity. This approach captures spatial relationships effectively while remaining computationally efficient. We evaluate our method on two benchmark traffic datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, and show that it achieves competitive performance compared to standard baselines and recent graph-based federated learning techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at FedKDD 2025: International Joint Workshop on Federated Learning for Data Mining and Graph Analytics. 6 pages, 1 figure</p></details> |

Although not only accuracy but also efficiency for scalability is important, some previous methods struggle to capture heterogeneity such as varying traffic patterns across regions and time periods. Moreover, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are the mainstream of traffic prediction, not only require predefined adjacency matrix, but also limit scalability to large-scale data containing many nodes due to their inherent complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose Deformable Dynamic Convolution Network (DDCN) for accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. Traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are limited in modeling non-Euclidean spatial structures and spatio-temporal heterogeneity, DDCN overcomes these challenges by dynamically applying deformable filters based on offset. Specifically, DDCN decomposes transformer-style CNN to encoder-decoder structure, and applies proposed approaches to the spatial and spatio-temporal attention blocks of the encoder to emphasize important features. The decoder, composed of feed-forward module, complements the output of the encoder. This novel structure make DDCN can perform accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. In comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets, DDCN achieves competitive performance, emphasizing the potential and effectiveness of CNN-based approaches for spatio-temporal traffic prediction.</p></details> | 7 pages |

Traffic planning experts rely on specialized platforms to simulate traffic systems, assessing the efficacy of the road network across various states of modifications. Nevertheless, a prevailing issue persists: many existing traffic planning platforms exhibit inefficiencies in flexibly interacting with the road network's structure and attributes and intuitively comparing multiple states during the iterative planning process. This paper introduces TraSculptor, an interactive planning decision-making system. To develop TraSculptor, we identify and address two challenges: interactive modification of road networks and intuitive comparison of multiple network states. For the first challenge, we establish flexible interactions to enable experts to easily and directly modify the road network on the map. For the second challenge, we design a comparison view with a history tree of multiple states and a road-state matrix to facilitate intuitive comparison of road network states. To evaluate TraSculptor, we provided a usage scenario where the Braess's paradox was showcased, invited experts to perform a case study on the Sioux Falls network, and collected expert feedback through interviews.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics</p></details> |
| **[Simplifying Traffic Anomaly Detection with Video Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09338v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent methods for ego-centric Traffic Anomaly Detection (TAD) often rely on complex multi-stage or multi-representation fusion architectures, yet it remains unclear whether such complexity is necessary. Recent findings in visual perception suggest that foundation models, enabled by advanced pre-training, allow simple yet flexible architectures to outperform specialized designs. Therefore, in this work, we investigate an architecturally simple encoder-only approach using plain Video Vision Transformers (Video ViTs) and study how pre-training enables strong TAD performance. We find that: (i) strong pre-training enables simple encoder-only models to match or even surpass the performance of specialized state-of-the-art TAD methods, while also being significantly more efficient; (ii) although weakly- and fully-supervised pre-training are advantageous on standard benchmarks, we find them less effective for TAD. Instead, self-supervised Masked Video Modeling (MVM) provides the strongest signal; and (iii) Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT) on unlabeled driving videos further improves downstream performance, without requiring anomalous examples. Our findings highlight the importance of pre-training and show that effective, efficient, and scalable TAD models can be built with minimal architectural complexity. We release our code, domain-adapted encoders, and fine-tuned models to support future work: https://github.com/tue-mps/simple-tad.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCVW...</summary><p>ICCVW 2025 accepted.

The SUs can reshape their traffic demands by modifying the semantic extraction factor, while the RIS can reconfigure the channel conditions via the passive beamforming. This provides the AP with greater flexibility to decode the superimposed signals from the SUs. We aim to minimize the system's overall energy consumption, while ensuring that each SU's traffic demand is satisfied. Hence, we formulate a joint optimization problem of the SUs' decoding order and semantic control, as well as the RIS's passive beamforming strategy. This problem is intractable due to the complicated coupling in constraints. To solve this, we decompose the original problem into two subproblems and solve them by using a series of approximate methods. Numerical results show that the joint traffic reshaping and channel reconfiguration scheme significantly improves the energy saving performance of the NOMA transmissions compared to the benchmark methods.</p></details> |  |

We use the Spatiotemporal Generative Adversarial Network (STGAN) framework combining Graph Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks to capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies in traffic data. We apply STGAN to real-time, minute-by-minute observations from 42 traffic cameras across Gothenburg, Sweden, collected over several months in 2020. The images are processed to compute a flow metric representing vehicle density, which serves as input for the model. Training is conducted on data from April to November 2020, and validation is performed on a separate dataset from November 14 to 23, 2020. Our results demonstrate that the model effectively detects traffic anomalies with high precision and low false positive rates. The detected anomalies include camera signal interruptions, visual artifacts, and extreme weather conditions affecting traffic flow.</p></details> |  |

This can induce stress. Detecting stress is a key point in maintaining the high safety standards of ATC. However, processing ATC voice data entails privacy restrictions, e.g. the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) law. Anonymizing the ATC voice data is one way to comply with these restrictions. In this paper, different architectures for stress detection for anonymized ATCO speech are evaluated. Our best networks reach a stress detection accuracy of 93.6% on an anonymized version of the Speech Under Simulated and Actual Stress (SUSAS) dataset and an accuracy of 80.1% on our anonymized ATC simulation dataset. This shows that privacy does not have to be an impediment in building well-performing deep-learning-based models.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables, publication identification number (URN)- urn:nbn:de:101:1-2022122008393409239462, see archived online publication- https://d-nb.info/127614606X/34 & Katalogeintrag: https://d-nb.info/127614606X/</p></details> |

The uniqueness and existence of the entropy solution are proven via doubling of the variables arguments and convergent finite volume approximations, respectively. The primary goal is to establish that the finite volume numerical approximations of the system converge to the unique entropy solution at a rate of $\sqrt{\Delta t}$, even when using relatively less regular one-sided kernels, compared to the globally smooth kernels analyzed in [Num. Math., 156(1):237-271, 2024] and [IMA J. Numer. Anal., 44(6):3354-3392, 2024]. The applicability of the proven theory to a general class of systems of nonlocal balance laws coupled strongly through the convective part and weakly through the source part, is indicated. As the support of the kernel tends to zero, the convergence of the entropy solutions of the proposed model to its local counterparts [SIAM J. Math. Anal., 51: 3694--3713, 2019] is also discussed. Numerical simulations illustrating the behavior of the entropy solutions of the coupled nonlocal systems are also shown.</p></details> |  |

Traffic sign recognition, an essential component of autonomous vehicles, is particularly vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can compromise driving safety. In this paper, we propose an N-version machine learning (NVML) framework that integrates a safety-aware weighted soft voting mechanism. Our approach utilizes Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to assess potential safety risks and assign dynamic, safety-aware weights to the ensemble outputs. We evaluate the robustness of three-version NVML systems employing various voting mechanisms against adversarial samples generated using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that our NVML approach significantly enhances the robustness and safety of traffic sign recognition systems under adversarial conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages including appendix, 1 figure</p></details> |

However, pervasive missing data caused by sensor failures and heterogeneous sensing gaps fundamentally hinders reliable traffic modeling. This paper proposes a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model that synergizes low-rank tensor algebra with deep representation learning for robust traffic data imputation. The model innovatively embeds CP decomposition into neural architecture through learnable embedding projections, where sparse traffic tensors are encoded into dense latent factors across road segments, time intervals, and mobility metrics. A hierarchical feature fusion mechanism employs Hadamard products to explicitly model multilinear interactions, while stacked multilayer perceptron layers nonlinearly refine these representations to capture complex spatiotemporal couplings. Extensive evaluations on six urban traffic datasets demonstrate NCPF's superiority over six state-of-the-art baselines. By unifying CP decomposition's interpretable factor analysis with neural network's nonlinear expressive power, NCPF provides a principled yet flexible approaches for high-dimensional traffic data imputation, offering critical support for next-generation transportation digital twins and adaptive traffic control systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing state-of-the-art solutions often fail to meet the required level of protection against linkage attacks and demographic biases, leading to privacy leakage and inequity in data analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm designed to address the challenges regarding the balance of privacy, utility, and fairness in location-based vehicular traffic management systems. In this context, utility means providing reliable and meaningful traffic information, while fairness ensures that all regions and individuals are treated equitably in data use and decision-making. Employing differential privacy techniques, we enhance data security by integrating query-based data access with iterative shuffling and calibrated noise injection, ensuring that sensitive geographical data remains protected. We ensure adherence to epsilon-differential privacy standards by implementing the Laplace mechanism. We implemented our algorithm on vehicular location-based data from Norway, demonstrating its ability to maintain data utility for traffic management and urban planning while ensuring fair representation of all geographical areas without being overrepresented or underrepresented. Additionally, we have created a heatmap of Norway based on our model, illustrating the privatized and fair representation of the traffic conditions across various cities.

Without relying on simulation, we derive a series of coupled delay differential equations to model vehicular interactions. By introducing a mnemonic-based symbolic system, we establish a mathematical framework incorporating stochastic initial conditions, non-uniform reaction times, and cognitive lag. A full linear stability analysis is conducted using Fourier decomposition and modal perturbation techniques. Our results identify critical thresholds for harmonic induction, delineate the bounds of safe following distances, and reveal hysteresis in driver overcorrection. The analysis concludes with implications for autonomous vehicle control and potential suppression strategies for oscillatory instability. All derivations are purely symbolic and analytically proven.</p></details> | 79 pages |

Using a novel network algorithm and Mexican census data from 2005 to 2020, we first quantify changes in the strength of domestic and international migration networks across all Mexican municipalities. We exploit variation in local homicide rates, using exogenous fuel price increases and municipalities' proximity to oil pipelines as instruments, to estimate the causal impact of violence on migration. During our study period, following intensified government crackdowns on drug trafficking organizations, many criminal groups fragmented and turned toward large-scale oil theft, driving sharp increases in violence in areas with oil pipelines, particularly when fuel prices rose. The findings show that rising violence increased emigration flows, predominantly within Mexico, and strengthened the intensity of emigration networks both domestically and toward the United States. Although violent municipalities continued to receive new residents, the rise in emigration was larger. Increasing homicide rates led to at least an additional 1.12 million people emigrating domestically and 50,200 fewer Mexicans returning from the United States. Violence also eroded regional connectivity, causing a long-term decline in daily vehicle traffic on highways linking violent areas to the rest of the country.</p></details> |  |

The proposed approach leverages a bird's-eye view video processing pipeline and zero-shot VLM capabilities to obtain structured information about surrounding vehicles, including their positions, dimensions, and velocities. Using this rich perception output, we construct elliptical collision-avoidance potential fields around other traffic participants, which are seamlessly integrated into a finite-horizon optimal control problem for trajectory planning. The resulting trajectory optimization is solved via differential dynamic programming with an adaptive regularization scheme and is embedded in an event-triggered MPC loop. To ensure collision-free motion, a safety verification layer is incorporated in the framework that provides an assessment of potential unsafe trajectories. Extensive simulations in Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) demonstrate that VisioPath outperforms conventional MPC baselines across multiple metrics. By combining modern AI-driven perception with the rigorous foundation of optimal control, VisioPath represents a significant step forward in safe trajectory planning for complex traffic systems.</p></details> |  |

To clarify this problem, we take three prior solutions presented for different but similar traffic classification and website fingerprinting tasks, and apply each solution's model to another solution's dataset. We pinpoint dataset-specific and model-specific properties that lead each of them to overperform in their specific evaluation context. As a realistic evaluation context that takes practical labeling constraints into account, we design an evaluation framework using two recent real-world TLS traffic datasets from large-scale networks. The framework simulates a futuristic scenario in which SNIs are hidden in some networks but not in others, and the classifier's goal is to predict destination services in one network's traffic, having been trained on a labelled dataset collected from a different network. Our framework has the distinction of including real-world distribution shift, while excluding concept drift. We show that, even when abundant labeled data is available, the best solutions' performances under distribution shift are between 30% and 40%, and a simple 1-Nearest Neighbor classifier's performance is not far behind. We depict all performances measured on different models, not just the best ones, for a fair representation of traffic models in practice.</p></details> |  |

There is an urgent need to ensure the reliability and robustness of autonomous driving systems (ADSs). Despite the recent achievements in testing various ADS modules, little attention has been paid on the automated testing of traffic light detection models in ADSs. A common practice is to manually collect and label traffic light data. However, it is labor-intensive, and even impossible to collect diverse data under different driving environments. To address these problems, we propose and implement TigAug to automatically augment labeled traffic light images for testing traffic light detection models in ADSs. We construct two families of metamorphic relations and three families of transformations based on a systematic understanding of weather environments, camera properties, and traffic light properties. We use augmented images to detect erroneous behaviors of traffic light detection models by transformation-specific metamorphic relations, and to improve the performance of traffic light detection models by retraining. Large-scale experiments with four state-of-the-art traffic light detection models and two traffic light datasets have demonstrated that i) TigAug is effective in testing traffic light detection models, ii) TigAug is efficient in synthesizing traffic light images, and iii) TigAug generates traffic light images with acceptable naturalness.</p></details> |  |

Assuming that CAVs can perceive the entry order of surrounding vehicles using computer vision technology and are capable of avoiding collisions, we introduce a voting-based distributed consensus algorithm inspired by Raft to resolve tie-breaking among simultaneously arriving CAVs. The algorithm is structured around the candidate and leader election processes and incorporates a minimal consensus quorum to ensure both safety and liveness among CAVs under typical asynchronous communication conditions. Assuming CAVs to be SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) Level-4 or higher autonomous vehicles, we implemented the proposed distributed consensus algorithm using gRPC. By adjusting variables such as the CAV-to-HV ratio, intersection scale, and the processing time of computer vision modules, we demonstrated that stable consensus can be achieved even under mixed-traffic conditions involving HVs without adequate functionalities to interact with CAVs. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm reached consensus at a typical unsignalized four-way, two-lane intersection in approximately 30-40 ms on average. A secondary vision-based system is employed to complete the crossing priorities based on the recognized lexicographical order of the license plate numbers in case the consensus procedure times out on an unreliable vehicle-to-vehicle communication network. The significance of this study lies in its ability to improve traffic flow at unsignalized intersections by enabling rapid determination of passing priority through distributed consensus even under mixed traffic with faulty vehicles.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[On the Robotic Uncertainty of Fully Autonomous Traffic: From Stochastic Car-Following to Mobility-Safety Trade-Offs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12611v3)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent transportation research highlights the potential of autonomous vehicles (AV) to improve traffic flow mobility as they are able to maintain smaller car-following distances. However, as a unique class of ground robots, AVs are susceptible to robotic errors, particularly in their perception and control modules with imperfect sensors and actuators, leading to uncertainties in their movements and an increased risk of collisions. Consequently, conservative operational strategies, such as larger headway and slower speeds, are implemented to prioritize safety over mobility in real-world operations. To reconcile the inconsistency, this paper presents an analytical model framework that delineates the endogenous reciprocity between traffic safety and mobility that arises from AVs' robotic uncertainties. Using both realistic car-following data and a stochastic intelligent driving model (IDM), the stochastic car-following distance is derived as a key parameter, enabling analysis of single-lane capacity and collision probability. A semi-Markov process is then employed to model the dynamics of the lane capacity, and the resulting collision-inclusive capacity, representing expected lane capacity under stationary conditions, serves as the primary performance metric for fully autonomous traffic. The analytical results are further utilized to investigate the impacts of critical parameters in AV and roadway designs on traffic performance, as well as the properties of optimal speed and headway under mobility-targeted or safety-dominated management objectives. Extensions to scenarios involving multiple non-independent collisions or multi-lane traffic scenarios are also discussed, which demonstrates the robustness of the theoretical results and their practical applications.</p></details> |  |

However, finding a manageable and finite, yet representative subset of scenarios in a scalable, possibly unsupervised manner is notoriously challenging. Our work is meant to constitute a cornerstone to facilitate sample-efficient testing, while still capturing the diversity of relevant operational design domains (ODDs) and accounting for the "long tail" phenomenon in particular. To this end, we first propose an expressive and flexible heterogeneous, spatio-temporal graph model for representing traffic scenarios. Leveraging recent advances of graph neural networks (GNNs), we then propose a self-supervised method to learn a universal embedding space for scenario graphs that enables clustering and similarity search. In particular, we implement contrastive learning alongside a bootstrapping-based approach and evaluate their suitability for partitioning the scenario space. Experiments on the nuPlan dataset confirm the model's ability to capture semantics and thus group related scenarios in a meaningful way despite the absence of discrete class labels. Different scenario types materialize as distinct clusters. Our results demonstrate how variable-length traffic scenarios can be condensed into single vector representations that enable nearest-neighbor retrieval of representative candidates for distinct scenario categories. Notably, this is achieved without manual labeling or bias towards an explicit objective such as criticality. Ultimately, our approach can serve as a basis for scalable selection of scenarios to further enhance the efficiency and robustness of testing AVs in simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted in the IEEE IAVVC 2025 conference</p></details> |

This leads to challenges in achieving timing predictability techniques due to access contention on shared resources, which can be mitigated using hardware-based spatial and temporal isolation techniques. Focusing on the interconnect as the point of access for shared resources, we propose AXI-REALM, a lightweight, modular, technology-independent, and open-source real-time extension to AXI4 interconnects. AXI-REALM uses a budget-based mechanism enforced on periodic time windows and transfer fragmentation to provide fair arbitration, coupled with execution predictability on real-time workloads. AXI-REALM features a comprehensive bandwidth and latency monitor at both the ingress and egress of the interconnect system. Latency information is also used to detect and reset malfunctioning subordinates, preventing missed deadlines. We provide a detailed cost assessment in a 12 nm node and an end-to-end case study implementing AXI-REALM into an open-source MCS, incurring an area overhead of less than 2%. When running a mixed-criticality workload, with a time-critical application sharing the interconnect with non-critical applications, we demonstrate that the critical application can achieve up to 68.2% of the isolated performance by enforcing fairness on the interconnect traffic through burst fragmentation, thus reducing the subordinate access latency by up to 24 times. Near-ideal performance, (above 95% of the isolated performance) can be achieved by distributing the available bandwidth in favor of the critical application.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 13 figures, 3 tables, accepted as a regular paper in IEEE Transactions on Computers</p></details> |

We propose a fully LLM-based solution that predicts the incident impact using a combination of traffic features and LLM-extracted incident features. A key ingredient of this solution is an effective method of selecting examples for the LLM's in-context learning. We evaluate the performance of three advanced LLMs and two state-of-the-art machine learning models on a real traffic incident dataset. The results show that the best-performing LLM matches the accuracy of the most accurate machine learning model, despite the former not having been trained on this prediction task.

Traditionally, cellular network time-series have been considered for this prediction task. More recently, exogenous factors such as points of interest and other environmental knowledge have been explored too. In contrast to incorporating external factors, we propose to learn the processes underlying cellular load generation by employing population dynamics data. In this study, we focus on smart roads and use road traffic measures to improve prediction accuracy. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that by employing road flow and speed, in addition to cellular network metrics, base station load prediction errors can be substantially reduced, by as much as $56.5\%.$ The code, visualizations and extensive results are available on https://github.com/nvassileva/DataMatters.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[MCST-Mamba: Multivariate Mamba-Based Model for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03927v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate traffic prediction plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems by enabling efficient routing, congestion mitigation, and proactive traffic control. However, forecasting is challenging due to the combined effects of dynamic road conditions, varying traffic patterns across different locations, and external influences such as weather and accidents. Traffic data often consists of several interrelated measurements - such as speed, flow and occupancy - yet many deep-learning approaches either predict only one of these variables or require a separate model for each. This limits their ability to capture joint patterns across channels. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Channel Spatio-Temporal (MCST) Mamba model, a forecasting framework built on the Mamba selective state-space architecture that natively handles multivariate inputs and simultaneously models all traffic features. The proposed MCST-Mamba model integrates adaptive spatio-temporal embeddings and separates the modeling of temporal sequences and spatial sensor interactions into two dedicated Mamba blocks, improving representation learning. Unlike prior methods that evaluate on a single channel, we assess MCST-Mamba across all traffic features at once, aligning more closely with how congestion arises in practice. Our results show that MCST-Mamba achieves strong predictive performance with a lower parameter count compared to baseline models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Communications Software and Multimedia track of the 2025 IEEE Global Communications Conference</p></details> |

With the popularity of devices, related security and privacy risks arise at the same time as they collect user-related data and transmit it to various service providers. Although China accounts for a larger share of the consumer IoT industry, current analyses on consumer IoT device traffic primarily focus on regions such as Europe, the United States, and Australia. Research on China, however, is currently relatively rare. This study constructs the first large-scale dataset about consumer IoT device traffic in China. Specifically, we propose a fine-grained traffic collection guidance covering the entire lifecycle of consumer IoT devices, gathering traffic from 77 devices spanning 38 brands and 12 device categories. Based on this dataset, we analyze traffic destinations and encryption practices across different device types during the entire lifecycle and compare the findings with the results of other regions. Compared to other regions, our results show that consumer IoT devices in China rely more on domestic services and overall perform better in terms of encryption practices. However, there are still 23/40 devices improperly conducting certificate validation, and 2/70 devices use insecure encryption protocols. To facilitate future research, we open-source our traffic collection guidance and make our dataset publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chat2SPaT: A Large Language Model Based Tool for Automating Traffic Signal Control Plan Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05283v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-timed traffic signal control, commonly used for operating signalized intersections and coordinated arterials, requires tedious manual work for signaling plan creating and updating. When the time-of-day or day-of-week plans are utilized, one intersection is often associated with multiple plans, leading to further repetitive manual plan parameter inputting. To enable a user-friendly traffic signal control plan management process, this study proposes Chat2SPaT, a method to convert users' semi-structured and ambiguous descriptions on the signal control plan to exact signal phase and timing (SPaT) results, which could further be transformed into structured stage-based or ring-based plans to interact with intelligent transportation system (ITS) software and traffic signal controllers. With curated prompts, Chat2SPaT first leverages large language models' (LLMs) capability of understanding users' plan descriptions and reformulate the plan as a combination of phase sequence and phase attribute results in the json format. Based on LLM outputs, python scripts are designed to locate phases in a cycle, address nuances of traffic signal control, and finally assemble the complete traffic signal control plan. Within a chat, the pipeline can be utilized iteratively to conduct further plan editing. Experiments show that Chat2SPaT can generate plans with an accuracy of over 94% for both English and Chinese cases, using a test dataset with over 300 plan descriptions. As the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capability of understanding traffic signal control plan descriptions, Chat2SPaT provides an easy-to-use plan management pipeline for traffic practitioners and researchers, serving as a potential new building block for a more accurate and versatile application of LLMs in the field of ITS. The source codes, prompts and test dataset are openly accessible at https://github.com/yuewangits/Chat2SPaT.</p></details> |  |

Existing machine learning models often rely only on a single representation of packets or flows, limiting their ability to capture the contextual relationships essential for robust analysis. Furthermore, task-specific architectures for supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning lead to inefficiencies in adapting to varying data formats and security tasks. To address these gaps, we propose UniNet, a unified framework that introduces a novel multi-granular traffic representation (T-Matrix), integrating session, flow, and packet-level features to provide comprehensive contextual information. Combined with T-Attent, a lightweight attention-based model, UniNet efficiently learns latent embeddings for diverse security tasks. Extensive evaluations across four key network security and privacy problems--anomaly detection, attack classification, IoT device identification, and encrypted website fingerprinting--demonstrate UniNet's significant performance gain over state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher accuracy, lower false positive rates, and improved scalability. By addressing the limitations of single-level models and unifying traffic analysis paradigms, UniNet sets a new benchmark for modern network security.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages,6 figures, 12 tables; accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking, 2025</p></details> |

Communication between nodes can be observed by network level attackers as it inherently takes place in the open. Despite online services increasingly using encrypted traffic, the shape of the traffic is not hidden. To prevent traffic analysis, the shape of a system's traffic must be independent of secrets. We investigate adapting the data-oblivious approach the reactive setting and present OblivIO, a secure language for writing reactive programs driven by network events. Our approach pads with dummy messages to hide which program sends are genuinely executed. We use an information-flow type system to provably enforce timing-sensitive noninterference. The type system is extended with potentials to bound the overhead in traffic introduced by our approach. We address challenges that arise from joining data-oblivious and reactive programming and demonstrate the feasibility of our resulting language by developing an interpreter that implements security critical operations as constant-time algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 16 figures, Technical report for paper submitted to CSF 2023</p></details> |

Most state-of-the-art (SotA) prediction models primarily focus on forecasting the most likely future. However, for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles, it is equally important to cover the distribution for plausible motion alternatives. To address this, we introduce EP-Diffuser, a novel parameter-efficient diffusion-based generative model designed to capture the distribution of possible traffic scene evolutions. Conditioned on road layout and agent history, our model acts as a predictor and generates diverse, plausible scene continuations. We benchmark EP-Diffuser against two SotA models in terms of accuracy and plausibility of predictions on the Argoverse 2 dataset. Despite its significantly smaller model size, our approach achieves both highly accurate and plausible traffic scene predictions. We further evaluate model generalization ability in an out-of-distribution (OoD) test setting using Waymo Open dataset and show superior robustness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Traffic Signal Control based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. Case Study on a simulated real-world corridor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02189v4)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous studies that have formulated multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for adaptive traffic signal control have primarily used value-based RL methods. However, recent literature has shown that policy-based methods may perform better in partially observable environments. Additionally, RL methods remain largely untested for real-world normally signal timing plans because of the simplifying assumptions common in the literature. The current study attempts to address these gaps and formulates a multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MA-PPO) algorithm to implement adaptive and coordinated traffic control along an arterial corridor. The formulated MA-PPO has a centralized-critic architecture under a centralized training and decentralized execution framework. Agents are designed to allow selection and implementation of up to eight signal phases, as commonly implemented in field controllers. The formulated algorithm is tested on a simulated real-world seven intersection corridor. The speed of convergence for each agent was found to depend on the size of the action space, which depends on the number and sequence of signal phases. The performance of the formulated MA-PPO adaptive control algorithm is compared with the field implemented actuated-coordinated signal control (ASC), modeled using PTV-Vissim-MaxTime software in the loop simulation (SILs). The trained MA-PPO performed significantly better than the ASC for all movements. Compared to ASC the MA-PPO showed 2% and 24% improvements in travel time in the primary and secondary coordination directions, respectively. For cross streets movements MA-PPO also showed significant crossing time reductions. Volume sensitivity experiments revealed that the formulated MA-PPO demonstrated good stability, robustness, and adaptability to changes in traffic demand.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the impact of coordinated fleets size on traffic efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15742v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate a traffic assignment problem on a transportation network, considering both the demands of individual drivers and of a large fleet controlled by a central operator (minimizing the fleet's average travel time). We formulate this problem as a two-player convex game and we study how the size of the coordinated fleet, measured in terms of share of the total demand, influences the Price of Anarchy (PoA). We show that, for two-terminal networks, there are cases in which the fleet must reach a minimum share before actually affecting the PoA, which otherwise remains unchanged. Moreover, for parallel networks we prove that, under suitable assumptions, the PoA is monotonically non-increasing in the fleet share.</p></details> |  |
| **[MamNet: A Novel Hybrid Model for Time-Series Forecasting and Frequency Pattern Analysis in Network Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00304v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The abnormal fluctuations in network traffic may indicate potential security threats or system failures. Therefore, efficient network traffic prediction and anomaly detection methods are crucial for network security and traffic management. This paper proposes a novel network traffic prediction and anomaly detection model, MamNet, which integrates time-domain modeling and frequency-domain feature extraction. The model first captures the long-term dependencies of network traffic through the Mamba module (time-domain modeling), and then identifies periodic fluctuations in the traffic using Fourier Transform (frequency-domain feature extraction). In the feature fusion layer, multi-scale information is integrated to enhance the model's ability to detect network traffic anomalies. Experiments conducted on the UNSW-NB15 and CAIDA datasets demonstrate that MamNet outperforms several recent mainstream models in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1-Score. Specifically, it achieves an improvement of approximately 2% to 4% in detection performance for complex traffic patterns and long-term trend detection. The results indicate that MamNet effectively captures anomalies in network traffic across different time scales and is suitable for anomaly detection tasks in network security and traffic management. Future work could further optimize the model structure by incorporating external network event information, thereby improving the model's adaptability and stability in complex network environments.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Geminet: Learning the Duality-based Iterative Process for Lightweight Traffic Engineering in Changing Topologies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23640v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, researchers have explored ML-based Traffic Engineering (TE), leveraging neural networks to solve TE problems traditionally addressed by optimization. However, existing ML-based TE schemes remain impractical: they either fail to handle topology changes or suffer from poor scalability due to excessive computational and memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose Geminet, a lightweight and scalable ML-based TE framework that can handle changing topologies. Geminet is built upon two key insights: (i) a methodology that decouples neural networks from topology by learning an iterative gradient-descent-based adjustment process, as the update rule of gradient descent is topology-agnostic, relying only on a few gradient-related quantities; (ii) shifting optimization from path-level routing weights to edge-level dual variables, reducing memory consumption by leveraging the fact that edges are far fewer than paths. Evaluations on WAN and data center datasets show that Geminet significantly improves scalability. Its neural network size is only 0.04% to 7% of existing schemes, while handling topology variations as effectively as HARP, a state-of-the-art ML-based TE approach, without performance degradation. When trained on large-scale topologies, Geminet consumes under 10 GiB of memory, more than eight times less than the 80-plus GiB required by HARP, while achieving 5.45 times faster convergence speed, demonstrating its potential for large-scale deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Central-Upwind Scheme for the Phase-Transition Traffic Flow Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12153v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Phase-transition models are an important family of non-equilibrium continuum traffic flow models, offering properties like replicating complex traffic phenomena, maintaining anisotropy, and promising potentials for accommodating automated vehicles. However, their complex mathematical characteristics such as discontinuous solution domains, pose numerical challenges and limit their exploration in traffic flow theory. This paper focuses on developing a robust and accurate numerical method for phase-transition traffic flow models: We propose a second-order semi-discrete central-upwind scheme specifically designed for discontinuous phase-transition models. This novel scheme incorporates the projection onto appropriate flow domains, ensuring enhanced handling of discontinuities and maintaining physical consistency and accuracy. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme through extensive and challenging numerical tests, showcasing their potential to facilitate further research and application in phase-transition traffic flow modeling. The ability of phase-transition models to embed the ``time-gap'' -- a crucial element in automated traffic control -- as a conserved variable aligns seamlessly with the control logic of automated vehicles, presenting significant potential for future applications, and the proposed numerical scheme now substantially facilitates exploring such potentials.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Joint Topology-Data Fusion Graph Network for Robust Traffic Speed Prediction with Data Anomalism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00085v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate traffic prediction is essential for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), yet current methods struggle with the inherent complexity and non-linearity of traffic dynamics, making it difficult to integrate spatial and temporal characteristics. Furthermore, existing approaches use static techniques to address non-stationary and anomalous historical data, which limits adaptability and undermines data smoothing. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Graph Fusion Enhanced Network (GFEN), an innovative framework for network-level traffic speed prediction. GFEN introduces a novel topological spatiotemporal graph fusion technique that meticulously extracts and merges spatial and temporal correlations from both data distribution and network topology using trainable methods, enabling the modeling of multi-scale spatiotemporal features. Additionally, GFEN employs a hybrid methodology combining a k-th order difference-based mathematical framework with an attention-based deep learning structure to adaptively smooth historical observations and dynamically mitigate data anomalies and non-stationarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GFEN surpasses state-of-the-art methods by approximately 6.3% in prediction accuracy and exhibits convergence rates nearly twice as fast as recent hybrid models, confirming its superior performance and potential to significantly enhance traffic prediction system efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods struggle with low-light conditions due to issues like indistinct small-object features, limited feature interaction, and poor image quality, which degrade detection accuracy and speed. To address this issue, we propose YOLO-LLTS, an end-to-end real-time traffic sign detection algorithm specifically designed for low-light environments. YOLO-LLTS introduces three main contributions: the High-Resolution Feature Map for Small Object Detection (HRFM-SOD) module to enhance small-object detection by mitigating feature dilution; the Multi-branch Feature Interaction Attention (MFIA) module to improve information extraction through multi-scale features interaction; and the Prior-Guided Feature Enhancement Module (PGFE) to enhance image quality by addressing noise, low contrast, and blurriness. Additionally, we construct a novel dataset, the Chinese Nighttime Traffic Sign Sample Set (CNTSSS), covering diverse nighttime scenarios. Experiments show that YOLO-LLTS achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous best methods by 2.7% mAP50 and 1.6% mAP50:95 on TT100K-night, 1.3% mAP50 and 1.9% mAP50:95 on CNTSSS, 7.5% mAP50 and 9.8% mAP50:95 on GTSDB-night, and superior results on CCTSDB2021.

However, incorporating causal relations as seen in real-world videos into synthetic videos remains challenging. This work argues that precisely identifying the accident participants and capturing their related behaviors are of critical importance. In this regard, we propose a novel diffusion model, Causal-VidSyn, for synthesizing egocentric traffic accident videos. To enable causal entity grounding in video diffusion, Causal-VidSyn leverages the cause descriptions and driver fixations to identify the accident participants and behaviors, facilitated by accident reason answering and gaze-conditioned selection modules. To support Causal-VidSyn, we further construct Drive-Gaze, the largest driver gaze dataset (with 1.54M frames of fixations) in driving accident scenarios. Extensive experiments show that Causal-VidSyn surpasses state-of-the-art video diffusion models in terms of frame quality and causal sensitivity in various tasks, including accident video editing, normal-to-accident video diffusion, and text-to-video generation.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 |

While existing surveys typically focus on isolated aspects of TSS, a comprehensive analytical framework bridging low-level and high-level perception tasks, particularly considering emerging technologies, remains lacking. This paper presents a systematic review of vision technologies in TSS, examining both low-level perception tasks (object detection, classification, and tracking) and high-level perception tasks (parameter estimation, anomaly detection, and behavior understanding). Specifically, we first provide a detailed methodological categorization and comprehensive performance evaluation for each task. Our investigation reveals five fundamental limitations in current TSS: perceptual data degradation in complex scenarios, data-driven learning constraints, semantic understanding gaps, sensing coverage limitations and computational resource demands. To address these challenges, we systematically analyze five categories of current approaches and potential trends: advanced perception enhancement, efficient learning paradigms, knowledge-enhanced understanding, cooperative sensing frameworks and efficient computing frameworks, critically assessing their real-world applicability. Furthermore, we evaluate the transformative potential of foundation models in TSS, which exhibit remarkable zero-shot learning abilities, strong generalization, and sophisticated reasoning capabilities across diverse tasks. This review provides a unified analytical framework bridging low-level and high-level perception tasks, systematically analyzes current limitations and solutions, and presents a structured roadmap for integrating emerging technologies, particularly foundation models, to enhance TSS capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, effective data recovery methods are essential to ensure the reliability of downstream data-driven applications. while classical tensor completion methods have been widely adopted, they are incapable of modeling noise, making them unsuitable for complex scenarios involving simultaneous data missingness and noise interference. Existing Robust Tensor Completion (RTC) approaches offer potential solutions by separately modeling the actual tensor data and noise. However, their effectiveness is often constrained by the over-relaxation of convex rank surrogates and the suboptimal utilization of local consistency, leading to inadequate model accuracy. To address these limitations, we first introduce the tensor L1-L2 norm, a novel non-convex tensor rank surrogate that functions as an effective low-rank representation tool. Leveraging an advanced feature fusion strategy, we further develop the gradient tensor L1-L2 norm by incorporating the tensor L1-L2 norm in the gradient domain. By integrating the gradient tensor nuclear L1-L2 norm into the RTC framework, we propose the Robust Tensor Completion via Gradient Tensor Nuclear L1-L2 Norm (RTC-GTNLN) model, which not only fully exploits both global low-rankness and local consistency without trade-off parameter, but also effectively handles the dual degradation challenges of missing data and noise in traffic data. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the RTC-GTNLN model consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in complex recovery scenarios involving simultaneous missing values and noise.</p></details> |  |

The growing interest in this challenge highlights the need for comprehensive datasets that capture unstructured environments, enabling the development of more robust prediction models to enhance pedestrian safety and vehicle navigation. In this paper, we introduce an Indian driving pedestrian dataset designed to address the complexities of modeling pedestrian behavior in unstructured environments, such as illumination changes, occlusion of pedestrians, unsignalized scene types and vehicle-pedestrian interactions. The dataset provides high-level and detailed low-level comprehensive annotations focused on pedestrians requiring the ego-vehicle's attention. Evaluation of the state-of-the-art intention prediction methods on our dataset shows a significant performance drop of up to $\mathbf{15\%}$, while trajectory prediction methods underperform with an increase of up to $\mathbf{1208}$ MSE, defeating standard pedestrian datasets. Additionally, we present exhaustive quantitative and qualitative analysis of intention and trajectory baselines. We believe that our dataset will open new challenges for the pedestrian behavior research community to build robust models.

They are used to test various road applications before real-world implementation. SUMO is a well-known simulator for road networks and intermodal traffic, often used in conjunction with other tools to test various types of applications. Realistic simulations require accurate movement models for different road users, such as cars, bicycles, and buses. While realistic models are already implemented for most vehicle types, bicycles, which are essential for achieving safe and efficient traffic, can only be modeled as slow vehicles or fast pedestrians at present. This paper introduces the Realistic Bicycle Dynamics Model (RBDM), the first dedicated bicycle model for SUMO, addressing this significant gap. Leveraging real-world bicycle data from the SimRa dataset, the RBDM implements realistic speed, acceleration, and deceleration behaviors of bicycles in urban scenarios. The evaluation is conducted using the Monaco SUMO traffic scenario and a newly generated Berlin scenario in SUMO. The RBDM significantly outperforms the existing slow-vehicle approximation in SUMO, aligning more closely with real-world data. These results underscore the necessity of a realistic bicycle movement model for accurate simulations, given the significant differences in the movement profiles of bicycles, cars, and pedestrians. Furthermore, the model is tested for its ability to generalize to disparate scenarios and urban topologies, which is dependent on the manner and geographical region in which the SimRa data were gathered. In addition, recommendations are provided for how it could be adapted for use in different city topologies.</p></details> |  |

The culmination of this vision would be a generative simulated city, where given a map of the city and an autonomous vehicle (AV) software stack, the simulator can seamlessly simulate the trip from point A to point B by populating the city around the AV and controlling all aspects of the scene, from animating the dynamic agents (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) to controlling the traffic light states. We refer to this vision as CitySim, which requires an agglomeration of simulation technologies: scene generation to populate the initial scene, agent behavior modeling to animate the scene, occlusion reasoning, dynamic scene generation to seamlessly spawn and remove agents, and environment simulation for factors such as traffic lights. While some key technologies have been separately studied in various works, others such as dynamic scene generation and environment simulation have received less attention in the research community. We propose SceneDiffuser++, the first end-to-end generative world model trained on a single loss function capable of point A-to-B simulation on a city scale integrating all the requirements above. We demonstrate the city-scale traffic simulation capability of SceneDiffuser++ and study its superior realism under long simulation conditions.

The World Health Organization 2023 report highlights that road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death among individuals aged 5-29, with over half of fatalities involving pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists. This study addresses this critical issue by identifying high-risk areas in Montgomery County, Maryland, contributing to the global goal of halving road traffic deaths and injuries by 2030. Using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and spatial autocorrelation analysis, we estimate collision densities and identify hotspots for targeted interventions. Our findings reveal significant spatial clustering of traffic collisions, with distinct patterns in densely populated urban areas and rural regions, offering valuable insights for policymakers to enhance road safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unveiling the Power of Noise Priors: Enhancing Diffusion Models for Mobile Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13794v3)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of mobile traffic, i.e., network traffic from cellular base stations, is crucial for optimizing network performance and supporting urban development. However, the non-stationary nature of mobile traffic, driven by human activity and environmental changes, leads to both regular patterns and abrupt variations. Diffusion models excel in capturing such complex temporal dynamics due to their ability to capture the inherent uncertainties. Most existing approaches prioritize designing novel denoising networks but often neglect the critical role of noise itself, potentially leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective by emphasizing the role of noise in the denoising process. Our analysis reveals that noise fundamentally shapes mobile traffic predictions, exhibiting distinct and consistent patterns. We propose NPDiff, a framework that decomposes noise into prior and residual components, with the prior} derived from data dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to capture both regular and abrupt variations. NPDiff can seamlessly integrate with various diffusion-based prediction models, delivering predictions that are effective, efficient, and robust. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it achieves superior performance with an improvement over 30\%, offering a new perspective on leveraging diffusion models in this domain. We provide code and data at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/NPDiff.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluation of Traffic Signals for Daily Traffic Pattern](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21469v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The turning movement count data is crucial for traffic signal design, intersection geometry planning, traffic flow, and congestion analysis. This work proposes three methods called dynamic, static, and hybrid configuration for TMC-based traffic signals. A vision-based tracking system is developed to estimate the TMC of six intersections in Las Vegas using traffic cameras. The intersection design, route (e.g. vehicle movement directions), and signal configuration files with compatible formats are synthesized and imported into Simulation of Urban MObility for signal evaluation with realistic data. The initial experimental results based on estimated waiting times indicate that the cycle time of 90 and 120 seconds works best for all intersections. In addition, four intersections show better performance for dynamic signal timing configuration, and the other two with lower performance have a lower ratio of total vehicle count to total lanes of the intersection leg. Since daily traffic flow often exhibits a bimodal pattern, we propose a hybrid signal method that switches between dynamic and static methods, adapting to peak and off-peak traffic conditions for improved flow management. So, a built-in traffic generator module creates vehicle routes for 4 hours, including peak hours, and a signal design module produces signal schedule cycles according to static, dynamic, and hybrid methods. Vehicle count distributions are weighted differently for each zone (i.e., West, North, East, South) to generate diverse traffic patterns. The extended experimental results for 6 intersections with 4 hours of simulation time imply that zone-based traffic pattern distributions affect signal design selection. Although the static method works great for evenly zone-based traffic distribution, the hybrid method works well for highly weighted traffic at intersection pairs of the West-East and North-South zones.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Neuro-Symbolic Approach for Probabilistic Reasoning on Graph Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21873v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at predictive tasks on graph-structured data but often lack the ability to incorporate symbolic domain knowledge and perform general reasoning. Relational Bayesian Networks (RBNs), in contrast, enable fully generative probabilistic modeling over graph-like structures and support rich symbolic knowledge and probabilistic inference. This paper presents a neuro-symbolic framework that seamlessly integrates GNNs into RBNs, combining the learning strength of GNNs with the flexible reasoning capabilities of RBNs. We develop two implementations of this integration: one compiles GNNs directly into the native RBN language, while the other maintains the GNN as an external component. Both approaches preserve the semantics and computational properties of GNNs while fully aligning with the RBN modeling paradigm. We also propose a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference method for these neuro-symbolic models. To demonstrate the framework's versatility, we apply it to two distinct problems. First, we transform a GNN for node classification into a collective classification model that explicitly models homo- and heterophilic label patterns, substantially improving accuracy. Second, we introduce a multi-objective network optimization problem in environmental planning, where MAP inference supports complex decision-making. Both applications include new publicly available benchmark datasets. This work introduces a powerful and coherent neuro-symbolic approach to graph data, bridging learning and reasoning in ways that enable novel applications and improved performance across diverse tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR); under revision. 29 pages, 6 figures.

| **[LiteFat: Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning for Real-Time Driver Fatigue Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21756v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting driver fatigue is critical for road safety, as drowsy driving remains a leading cause of traffic accidents. Many existing solutions rely on computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.</p></details> | 6 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Data-Driven Extended Corresponding State Approach for Residual Property Prediction of Hydrofluoroolefins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21720v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hydrofluoroolefins are considered the most promising next-generation refrigerants due to their extremely low global warming potential values, which can effectively mitigate the global warming effect. However, the lack of reliable thermodynamic data hinders the discovery and application of newer and superior hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants. In this work, integrating the strengths of theoretical method and data-driven method, we proposed a neural network extended corresponding state model to predict the residual thermodynamic properties of hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants. The innovation is that the fluids are characterized through their microscopic molecular structures by the inclusion of graph neural network module and the specialized design of model architecture to enhance its generalization ability. The proposed model is trained using the highly accurate data of available known fluids, and evaluated via the leave-one-out cross-validation method. Compared to conventional extended corresponding state models or cubic equation of state, the proposed model shows significantly improved accuracy for density and energy properties in liquid and supercritical regions, with average absolute deviation of 1.49% (liquid) and 2.42% (supercritical) for density, 3.37% and 2.50% for residual entropy, 1.85% and 1.34% for residual enthalpy. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of embedding physics knowledge into the machine learning model. The proposed neural network extended corresponding state model is expected to significantly accelerate the discovery of novel hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Graph Neural Network for Compressed Speech Steganalysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21591v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Steganalysis methods based on deep learning (DL) often struggle with computational complexity and challenges in generalizing across different datasets. Incorporating a graph neural network (GNN) into steganalysis schemes enables the leveraging of relational data for improved detection accuracy and adaptability. This paper presents the first application of a Graph Neural Network (GNN), specifically the GraphSAGE architecture, for steganalysis of compressed voice over IP (VoIP) speech streams. The method involves straightforward graph construction from VoIP streams and employs GraphSAGE to capture hierarchical steganalysis information, including both fine grained details and high level patterns, thereby achieving high detection accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed approach performs well in uncovering quantization index modulation (QIM)-based steganographic patterns in VoIP signals. It achieves detection accuracy exceeding 98 percent even for short 0.5 second samples, and 95.17 percent accuracy under challenging conditions with low embedding rates, representing an improvement of 2.8 percent over the best performing state of the art methods. Furthermore, the model exhibits superior efficiency, with an average detection time as low as 0.016 seconds for 0.5-second samples an improvement of 0.003 seconds. This makes it efficient for online steganalysis tasks, providing a superior balance between detection accuracy and efficiency under the constraint of short samples with low embedding rates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Torque-based Graph Surgery:Enhancing Graph Neural Networks with Hierarchical Rewiring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21422v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning from graph-structured data, leveraging message passing to diffuse information and update node representations. However, most efforts have suggested that native interactions encoded in the graph may not be friendly for this process, motivating the development of graph rewiring methods. In this work, we propose a torque-driven hierarchical rewiring strategy, inspired by the notion of torque in classical mechanics, dynamically modulating message passing to improve representation learning in heterophilous graphs and enhance robustness against noisy graphs. Specifically, we define an interference-aware torque metric that integrates structural distance and energy scores to quantify the perturbation induced by edges, thereby encouraging each node to aggregate information from its nearest low-energy neighbors. We use the metric to hierarchically reconfigure the receptive field of each layer by judiciously pruning high-torque edges and adding low-torque links, suppressing propagation noise and boosting pertinent signals. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on both heterophilous and homophilous graphs, and maintains high accuracy on noisy graph.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Generation of Diverse Courses of Actions for Multi-Agent Operations using Binary Optimization and Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20031v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operations in disaster response, search \& rescue, and military missions that involve multiple agents demand automated processes to support the planning of the courses of action (COA). Moreover, traverse-affecting changes in the environment (rain, snow, blockades, etc.) may impact the expected performance of a COA, making it desirable to have a pool of COAs that are diverse in task distributions across agents. Further, variations in agent capabilities, which could be human crews and/or autonomous systems, present practical opportunities and computational challenges to the planning process. This paper presents a new theoretical formulation and computational framework to generate such diverse pools of COAs for operations with soft variations in agent-task compatibility. Key to the problem formulation is a graph abstraction of the task space and the pool of COAs itself to quantify its diversity. Formulating the COAs as a centralized multi-robot task allocation problem, a genetic algorithm is used for (order-ignoring) allocations of tasks to each agent that jointly maximize diversity within the COA pool and overall compatibility of the agent-task mappings. A graph neural network is trained using a policy gradient approach to then perform single agent task sequencing in each COA, which maximizes completion rates adaptive to task features. Our tests of the COA generation process in a simulated environment demonstrate significant performance gain over a random walk baseline, small optimality gap in task sequencing, and execution time of about 50 minutes to plan up to 20 COAs for 5 agent/100 task operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation in proceedings of IEEE CASE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Graph neural networks for residential location choice: connection to classical logit models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21334v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers have adopted deep learning for classical discrete choice analysis as it can capture complex feature relationships and achieve higher predictive performance. However, the existing deep learning approaches cannot explicitly capture the relationship among choice alternatives, which has been a long-lasting focus in classical discrete choice models. To address the gap, this paper introduces Graph Neural Network (GNN) as a novel framework to analyze residential location choice. The GNN-based discrete choice models (GNN-DCMs) offer a structured approach for neural networks to capture dependence among spatial alternatives, while maintaining clear connections to classical random utility theory. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the GNN-DCMs incorporate the nested logit (NL) model and the spatially correlated logit (SCL) model as two specific cases, yielding novel algorithmic interpretation through message passing among alternatives' utilities. Empirically, the GNN-DCMs outperform benchmark MNL, SCL, and feedforward neural networks in predicting residential location choices among Chicago's 77 community areas. Regarding model interpretation, the GNN-DCMs can capture individual heterogeneity and exhibit spatially-aware substitution patterns. Overall, these results highlight the potential of GNN-DCMs as a unified and expressive framework for synergizing discrete choice modeling and deep learning in the complex spatial choice contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Cognition from fMRI:A Comparative Study of Graph, Transformer, and Kernel Models Across Task and Rest Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21016v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting cognition from neuroimaging data in healthy individuals offers insights into the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive abilities, with potential applications in precision medicine and early detection of neurological and psychiatric conditions. This study systematically benchmarked classical machine learning (Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR)) and advanced deep learning (DL) models (Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Transformer-GNN (TGNN)) for cognitive prediction using Resting-state (RS), Working Memory, and Language task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset. Our results, based on R2 scores, Pearson correlation coefficient, and mean absolute error, revealed that task-based fMRI, eliciting neural responses directly tied to cognition, outperformed RS fMRI in predicting cognitive behavior. Among the methods compared, a GNN combining structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) consistently achieved the highest performance across all fMRI modalities; however, its advantage over KRR using FC alone was not statistically significant. The TGNN, designed to model temporal dynamics with SC as a prior, performed competitively with FC-based approaches for task-fMRI but struggled with RS data, where its performance aligned with the lower-performing GNN that directly used fMRI time-series data as node features. These findings emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate model architectures and feature representations to fully leverage the spatial and temporal richness of neuroimaging data. This study highlights the potential of multimodal graph-aware DL models to combine SC and FC for cognitive prediction, as well as the promise of Transformer-based approaches for capturing temporal dynamics. By providing a comprehensive comparison of models, this work serves as a guide for advancing brain-behavior modeling using fMRI, SC and DL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary version; a revised version will be uploaded later</p></details> |
| **[REGRACE: A Robust and Efficient Graph-based Re-localization Algorithm using Consistency Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03599v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loop closures are essential for correcting odometry drift and creating consistent maps, especially in the context of large-scale navigation. Current methods using dense point clouds for accurate place recognition do not scale well due to computationally expensive scan-to-scan comparisons. Alternative object-centric approaches are more efficient but often struggle with sensitivity to viewpoint variation. In this work, we introduce REGRACE, a novel approach that addresses these challenges of scalability and perspective difference in re-localization by using LiDAR-based submaps. We introduce rotation-invariant features for each labeled object and enhance them with neighborhood context through a graph neural network. To identify potential revisits, we employ a scalable bag-of-words approach, pooling one learned global feature per submap. Additionally, we define a revisit with geometrical consistency cues rather than embedding distance, allowing us to recognize far-away loop closures. Our evaluations demonstrate that REGRACE achieves similar results compared to state-of-the-art place recognition and registration baselines while being twice as fast. Code and models are publicly available.</p></details> | Accepted to IROS2025 |

Buildings with similar features often share energy patterns, reflected by spatial dependencies in their operational data, which conventional prediction methods struggle to capture. To overcome this, we propose a multi-building prediction approach using spatio-temporal graph neural networks, comprising graph representation, graph learning, and interpretation. First, a graph is built based on building characteristics and environmental factors. Next, a multi-level graph convolutional architecture with attention is developed for energy prediction. Lastly, a method interpreting the optimized graph structure is introduced. Experiments on the Building Data Genome Project 2 dataset confirm superior performance over baselines such as XGBoost, SVR, FCNN, GRU, and Naive, highlighting the method's robustness, generalization, and interpretability in capturing meaningful building similarities and spatial relationships.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Graph Neural Networks for Document Layout Analysis in Public Affairs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14699v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The automatic analysis of document layouts in digital-born PDF documents remains a challenging problem due to the heterogeneous arrangement of textual and nontextual elements and the imprecision of the textual metadata in the Portable Document Format. In this work, we benchmark Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures for the task of fine-grained layout classification of text blocks from digital native documents. We introduce two graph construction structures: a k-closest-neighbor graph and a fully connected graph, and generate node features via pre-trained text and vision models, thus avoiding manual feature engineering. Three experimental frameworks are evaluated: single-modality (text or visual), concatenated multimodal, and dual-branch multimodal. We evaluated four foundational GNN models and compared them with the baseline. Our experiments are specifically conducted on a rich dataset of public affairs documents that includes more than 20 sources (e.g., regional and national-level official gazettes), 37K PDF documents, with 441K pages in total. Our results demonstrate that GraphSAGE operating on the k-closest-neighbor graph in a dual-branch configuration achieves the highest per-class and overall accuracy, outperforming the baseline in some sources. These findings confirm the importance of local layout relationships and multimodal fusion exploited through GNNs for the analysis of native digital document layouts.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 2 figures, accepted paper at The Fifth ICDAR International Workshop on Machine Learning</p></details> |
| **[Mixture of Length and Pruning Experts for Knowledge Graphs Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20498v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning, which aims to infer new facts from structured knowledge repositories, plays a vital role in Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. Its effectiveness critically depends on constructing informative and contextually relevant reasoning paths. However, existing graph neural networks (GNNs) often adopt rigid, query-agnostic path-exploration strategies, limiting their ability to adapt to diverse linguistic contexts and semantic nuances. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{MoKGR}, a mixture-of-experts framework that personalizes path exploration through two complementary components: (1) a mixture of length experts that adaptively selects and weights candidate path lengths according to query complexity, providing query-specific reasoning depth; and (2) a mixture of pruning experts that evaluates candidate paths from a complementary perspective, retaining the most informative paths for each query. Through comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmark, MoKGR demonstrates superior performance in both transductive and inductive settings, validating the effectiveness of personalized path exploration in KGs reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shapley-Value-Based Graph Sparsification for GNN Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20460v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph sparsification is a key technique for improving inference efficiency in Graph Neural Networks by removing edges with minimal impact on predictions. GNN explainability methods generate local importance scores, which can be aggregated into global scores for graph sparsification. However, many explainability methods produce only non-negative scores, limiting their applicability for sparsification. In contrast, Shapley value based methods assign both positive and negative contributions to node predictions, offering a theoretically robust and fair allocation of importance by evaluating many subsets of graphs. Unlike gradient-based or perturbation-based explainers, Shapley values enable better pruning strategies that preserve influential edges while removing misleading or adversarial connections. Our approach shows that Shapley value-based graph sparsification maintains predictive performance while significantly reducing graph complexity, enhancing both interpretability and efficiency in GNN inference.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, existing approaches often struggle to effectively model the intricate interdependencies among spatial, temporal, and contextual variables that govern accident outcomes. In this study, we introduce STARN-GAT, a Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network, which leverages adaptive graph construction and modality-aware attention mechanisms to capture these complex relationships. Unlike conventional methods, STARN-GAT integrates road network topology, temporal traffic patterns, and environmental context within a unified attention-based framework. The model is evaluated on the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) dataset, achieving a Macro F1-score of 85 percent, ROC-AUC of 0.91, and recall of 81 percent for severe incidents. To ensure generalizability within the South Asian context, STARN-GAT is further validated on the ARI-BUET traffic accident dataset, where it attains a Macro F1-score of 0.84, recall of 0.78, and ROC-AUC of 0.89. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in identifying high-risk cases and its potential for deployment in real-time, safety-critical traffic management systems. Furthermore, the attention-based architecture enhances interpretability, offering insights into contributing factors and supporting trust in AI-assisted decision-making. Overall, STARN-GAT bridges the gap between advanced graph neural network techniques and practical applications in road safety analytics.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Network-based approaches have advanced multi-omics research by effectively capturing biologically relevant relationships among molecular entities. While these methods are powerful for representing molecular interactions, there remains a need for tools specifically designed to effectively utilize these network representations across diverse downstream analyses. To fulfill this need, we introduce BioNeuralNet, a flexible and modular Python framework tailored for end-to-end network-based multi-omics data analysis. BioNeuralNet leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn biologically meaningful low-dimensional representations from multi-omics networks, converting these complex molecular networks into versatile embeddings. BioNeuralNet supports all major stages of multi-omics network analysis, including several network construction techniques, generation of low-dimensional representations, and a broad range of downstream analytical tasks. Its extensive utilities, including diverse GNN architectures, and compatibility with established Python packages (e.g., scikit-learn, PyTorch, NetworkX), enhance usability and facilitate quick adoption. BioNeuralNet is an open-source, user-friendly, and extensively documented framework designed to support flexible and reproducible multi-omics network analysis in precision medicine.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables; Software available on PyPI as BioNeuralNet.

In this paper, we present Pyg 2.0 (and its subsequent minor versions), a comprehensive update that introduces substantial improvements in scalability and real-world application capabilities. We detail the framework's enhanced architecture, including support for heterogeneous and temporal graphs, scalable feature/graph stores, and various optimizations, enabling researchers and practitioners to tackle large-scale graph learning problems efficiently. Over the recent years, PyG has been supporting graph learning in a large variety of application areas, which we will summarize, while providing a deep dive into the important areas of relational deep learning and large language modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Observations to Causations: A GNN-based Probabilistic Prediction Framework for Causal Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20349v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery from observational data is challenging, especially with large datasets and complex relationships. Traditional methods often struggle with scalability and capturing global structural information. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel graph neural network (GNN)-based probabilistic framework that learns a probability distribution over the entire space of causal graphs, unlike methods that output a single deterministic graph. Our framework leverages a GNN that encodes both node and edge attributes into a unified graph representation, enabling the model to learn complex causal structures directly from data. The GNN model is trained on a diverse set of synthetic datasets augmented with statistical and information-theoretic measures, such as mutual information and conditional entropy, capturing both local and global data properties. We frame causal discovery as a supervised learning problem, directly predicting the entire graph structure. Our approach demonstrates superior performance, outperforming both traditional and recent non-GNN-based methods, as well as a GNN-based approach, in terms of accuracy and scalability on synthetic and real-world datasets without further training. This probabilistic framework significantly improves causal structure learning, with broad implications for decision-making and scientific discovery across various fields.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hypergraph Neural Networks Reveal Spatial Domains from Single-cell Transcriptomics Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19868v2)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of spatial clustering of transcriptomics data is of paramount importance. It enables the classification of tissue samples into diverse subpopulations of cells, which, in turn, facilitates the analysis of the biological functions of clusters, tissue reconstruction, and cell-cell interactions. Many approaches leverage gene expressions, spatial locations, and histological images to detect spatial domains; however, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as state of the art models suffer from a limitation in the assumption of pairwise connections between nodes. In the case of domain detection in spatial transcriptomics, some cells are found to be not directly related. Still, they are grouped as the same domain, which shows the incapability of GNNs for capturing implicit connections among the cells. While graph edges connect only two nodes, hyperedges connect an arbitrary number of nodes along their edges, which lets Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) capture and utilize richer and more complex structural information than traditional GNNs. We use autoencoders to address the limitation of not having the actual labels, which are well-suited for unsupervised learning. Our model has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving the highest iLISI score of 1.843 compared to other methods. This score indicates the greatest diversity of cell types identified by our method. Furthermore, our model outperforms other methods in downstream clustering, achieving the highest ARI values of 0.51 and Leiden score of 0.60.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Subgraph Matching by Combining Algorithms and Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20226v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Homomorphism is a key mapping technique between graphs that preserves their structure. Given a graph and a pattern, the subgraph homomorphism problem involves finding a mapping from the pattern to the graph, ensuring that adjacent vertices in the pattern are mapped to adjacent vertices in the graph. Unlike subgraph isomorphism, which requires a one-to-one mapping, homomorphism allows multiple vertices in the pattern to map to the same vertex in the graph, making it more complex. We propose HFrame, the first graph neural network-based framework for subgraph homomorphism, which integrates traditional algorithms with machine learning techniques. We demonstrate that HFrame outperforms standard graph neural networks by being able to distinguish more graph pairs where the pattern is not homomorphic to the graph. Additionally, we provide a generalization error bound for HFrame. Through experiments on both real-world and synthetic graphs, we show that HFrame is up to 101.91 times faster than exact matching algorithms and achieves an average accuracy of 0.962.</p></details> |  |

Currently, the most popular and high-performing SBR methods primarily leverage graph neural networks (GNNs), which model session sequences as graph-structured data to effectively capture user intent. However, most GNNs-based SBR methods primarily focus on modeling the ID sequence information of session sequences, while neglecting the rich semantic information embedded within them. This limitation significantly hampers model's ability to accurately infer users' true intention. To address above challenge, this paper proposes a novel SBR approach called Integrating LLM-Derived Multi-Semantic Intent into Graph Model for Session-based Recommendation (LLM-DMsRec). The method utilizes a pre-trained GNN model to select the top-k items as candidate item sets and designs prompts along with a large language model (LLM) to infer multi-semantic intents from these candidate items. Specifically, we propose an alignment mechanism that effectively integrates the semantic intent inferred by the LLM with the structural intent captured by GNNs. Extensive experiments conducted on the Beauty and ML-1M datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can be seamlessly integrated into GNNs framework, significantly enhancing its recommendation performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aggregation-aware MLP: An Unsupervised Approach for Graph Message-passing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20127v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a dominant approach to learning graph representations, primarily because of their message-passing mechanisms. However, GNNs typically adopt a fixed aggregator function such as Mean, Max, or Sum without principled reasoning behind the selection. This rigidity, especially in the presence of heterophily, often leads to poor, problem dependent performance. Although some attempts address this by designing more sophisticated aggregation functions, these methods tend to rely heavily on labeled data, which is often scarce in real-world tasks. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised framework, "Aggregation-aware Multilayer Perceptron" (AMLP), which shifts the paradigm from directly crafting aggregation functions to making MLP adaptive to aggregation. Our lightweight approach consists of two key steps: First, we utilize a graph reconstruction method that facilitates high-order grouping effects, and second, we employ a single-layer network to encode varying degrees of heterophily, thereby improving the capacity and applicability of the model. Extensive experiments on node clustering and classification demonstrate the superior performance of AMLP, highlighting its potential for diverse graph learning scenarios.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Graded Transformers: A Symbolic-Geometric Approach to Structured Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20108v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Graded Transformer framework, a novel class of sequence models that embeds algebraic inductive biases through grading transformations on vector spaces. Extending the theory of Graded Neural Networks (GNNs), we propose two architectures: the Linearly Graded Transformer (LGT) and the Exponentially Graded Transformer (EGT). These models apply parameterized scaling operators-governed by fixed or learnable grading tuples and, for EGT, exponential factors to infuse hierarchical structure into attention and representation layers, enhancing efficiency for structured data. We derive rigorous theoretical guarantees, including universal approximation theorems for continuous and Sobolev functions, reduced sample complexity via effective VC dimension bounds, Lipschitz continuity of graded operations, and robustness to adversarial perturbations. A graded loss function ensures gradient stability and alignment with domain priors during optimization. By treating grades as differentiable parameters, the framework enables adaptive feature prioritization, overcoming limitations of fixed grades in prior work. The Graded Transformer holds transformative potential for hierarchical learning and neurosymbolic reasoning, with applications spanning algebraic geometry (e.g., moduli spaces and zeta functions), physics (e.g., multiscale simulations), natural language processing (e.g., syntactic parsing), biological sequence analysis (e.g., variant prediction), and emerging areas like graph neural networks and financial modeling. This work advances structured deep learning by fusing geometric and algebraic principles with attention mechanisms, offering a mathematically grounded alternative to data-driven models and paving the way for interpretable, efficient systems in complex domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Who Owns This Sample: Cross-Client Membership Inference Attack in Federated Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19964v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-structured data is prevalent in many real-world applications, including social networks, financial systems, and molecular biology. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the de facto standard for learning from such data due to their strong representation capabilities. As GNNs are increasingly deployed in federated learning (FL) settings to preserve data locality and privacy, new privacy threats arise from the interaction between graph structures and decentralized training. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of cross-client membership inference attacks (CC-MIA) against node classification tasks of federated GNNs (FedGNNs), where a malicious client aims to infer which client owns the given data. Unlike prior centralized-focused work that focuses on whether a sample was included in training, our attack targets sample-to-client attribution, a finer-grained privacy risk unique to federated settings. We design a general attack framework that exploits FedGNNs' aggregation behaviors, gradient updates, and embedding proximity to link samples to their source clients across training rounds. We evaluate our attack across multiple graph datasets under realistic FL setups. Results show that our method achieves high performance on both membership inference and ownership identification. Our findings highlight a new privacy threat in federated graph learning-client identity leakage through structural and model-level cues, motivating the need for attribution-robust GNN design.</p></details> |  |

While GNNs have demonstrated broad applicability, understanding their expressive power remains an important question. In this paper, we propose GNN architectures that correspond precisely to prominent fragments of first-order logic (FO), including various modal logics as well as more expressive two-variable fragments. To establish these results, we apply methods from finite model theory of first-order and modal logics to the domain of graph representation learning. Our results provide a unifying framework for understanding the logical expressiveness of GNNs within FO.</p></details> | 21 pages |

These representations are typically assumed to capture rule-like inference patterns. However, our theoretical understanding of which inference patterns can be captured remains limited. Ideally, KG embedding methods should be expressive enough such that for any set of rules, there exist relation embeddings that exactly capture these rules. This principle has been studied within the framework of region-based embeddings, but existing models are severely limited in the kinds of rule bases that can be captured. We argue that this stems from the fact that entity embeddings are only compared in a coordinate-wise fashion. As an alternative, we propose RESHUFFLE, a simple model based on ordering constraints that can faithfully capture a much larger class of rule bases than existing approaches. Most notably, RESHUFFLE can capture bounded inference w.r.t. arbitrary sets of closed path rules. The entity embeddings in our framework can be learned by a Graph Neural Network (GNN), which effectively acts as a differentiable rule base.</p></details> | Accepted for KR 2025 |

However, predicting these co-visitation patterns across millions of venues remains challenging due to extreme data sparsity and the complex interplay between spatial proximity and business relationships. Traditional approaches using only geographic distance fail to capture why coffee shops attract different customer flows than fine dining restaurants, even when co-located. We introduce NAICS-aware GraphSAGE, a novel graph neural network that integrates business taxonomy knowledge through learnable embeddings to predict population-scale co-visitation patterns. Our key insight is that business semantics, captured through detailed industry codes, provide crucial signals that pure spatial models cannot explain. The approach scales to massive datasets (4.2 billion potential venue pairs) through efficient state-wise decomposition while combining spatial, temporal, and socioeconomic features in an end-to-end framework. Evaluated on our POI-Graph dataset comprising 94.9 million co-visitation records across 92,486 brands and 48 US states, our method achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines: the R-squared value increases from 0.243 to 0.625 (a 157 percent improvement), with strong gains in ranking quality (32 percent improvement in NDCG at 10).</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art models are generally graph neural networks that employ message passing to iteratively update atomic embeddings that are ultimately used for predicting properties. In this work we extend the message passing formalism with the inclusion of a continuous variable that accounts for fractional atomic existence. This allows us to calculate the gradient of the Gibbs free energy with respect to both the Cartesian coordinates of atoms and their existence. Using this we propose a gradient-based grand canonical optimization method and document its capabilities for a Cu(110) surface oxide.</p></details> |  |

These challenges call for adaptable learning-based methods capable of capturing complex interactions beyond explicit physical models and simulations. While graph neural networks can handle simple scenarios, they struggle with complex scenes and long-term predictions. We introduce a novel framework for modeling rigid body dynamics and learning collision interactions, addressing key limitations of existing graph-based methods. Our approach extends the traditional representation of meshes by incorporating higher-order topology complexes, offering a physically consistent representation. Additionally, we propose a physics-informed message-passing neural architecture, embedding physical laws directly in the model. Our method demonstrates superior accuracy, even during long rollouts, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen scenarios. Importantly, this work addresses the challenge of multi-entity dynamic interactions, with applications spanning diverse scientific and engineering domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures.

| **[Epidemiology-informed Network for Robust Rumor Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12949v3)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid spread of rumors on social media has posed significant challenges to maintaining public trust and information integrity. Since an information cascade process is essentially a propagation tree, recent rumor detection models leverage graph neural networks to additionally capture information propagation patterns, thus outperforming text-only solutions. Given the variations in topics and social impact of the root node, different source information naturally has distinct outreach capabilities, resulting in different heights of propagation trees. This variation, however, impedes the data-driven design of existing graph-based rumor detectors. Given a shallow propagation tree with limited interactions, it is unlikely for graph-based approaches to capture sufficient cascading patterns, questioning their ability to handle less popular news or early detection needs. In contrast, a deep propagation tree is prone to noisy user responses, and this can in turn obfuscate the predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel Epidemiology-informed Network (EIN) that integrates epidemiological knowledge to enhance performance by overcoming data-driven methods sensitivity to data quality. Meanwhile, to adapt epidemiology theory to rumor detection, it is expected that each users stance toward the source information will be annotated. To bypass the costly and time-consuming human labeling process, we take advantage of large language models to generate stance labels, facilitating optimization objectives for learning epidemiology-informed representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed EIN not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets but also exhibits enhanced robustness across varying tree depths.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Web Conference 2025 (WWW2025)</p></details> |

Yet transmitting raw point clouds or full feature maps overwhelms Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications, causing latency and scalability problems. We introduce EffiComm, an end-to-end framework that transmits less than 40% of the data required by prior art while maintaining state-of-the-art 3D object detection accuracy. EffiComm operates on Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) feature maps from any modality and applies a two-stage reduction pipeline: (1) Selective Transmission (ST) prunes low-utility regions with a confidence mask; (2) Adaptive Grid Reduction (AGR) uses a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to assign vehicle-specific keep ratios according to role and network load. The remaining features are fused with a soft-gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) attention layer, offering greater capacity and specialization for effective feature integration. On the OPV2V benchmark, EffiComm reaches 0.84 mAP@0.7 while sending only an average of approximately 1.5 MB per frame, outperforming previous methods on the accuracy-per-bit curve. These results highlight the value of adaptive, learned communication for scalable Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ITSC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Generating Clinically Realistic EHR Data via a Hierarchy- and Semantics-Guided Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20719v2)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating realistic synthetic electronic health records (EHRs) holds tremendous promise for accelerating healthcare research, facilitating AI model development and enhancing patient privacy. However, existing generative methods typically treat EHRs as flat sequences of discrete medical codes. This approach overlooks two critical aspects: the inherent hierarchical organization of clinical coding systems and the rich semantic context provided by code descriptions. Consequently, synthetic patient sequences often lack high clinical fidelity and have limited utility in downstream clinical tasks. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchy- and Semantics-Guided Transformer (HiSGT), a novel framework that leverages both hierarchical and semantic information for the generative process. HiSGT constructs a hierarchical graph to encode parent-child and sibling relationships among clinical codes and employs a graph neural network to derive hierarchy-aware embeddings. These are then fused with semantic embeddings extracted from a pre-trained clinical language model (e.g., ClinicalBERT), enabling the Transformer-based generator to more accurately model the nuanced clinical patterns inherent in real EHRs. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that HiSGT significantly improves the statistical alignment of synthetic data with real patient records, as well as supports robust downstream applications such as chronic disease classification. By addressing the limitations of conventional raw code-based generative models, HiSGT represents a significant step toward clinically high-fidelity synthetic data generation and a general paradigm suitable for interpretable medical code representation, offering valuable applications in data augmentation and privacy-preserving healthcare analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The camera ready version for ECAI-2025</p></details> |

Learning-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative, and among them, graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their excellent performance in solving power control problems. However, all existing GNN-based approaches assume ideal orthogonality among pilot sequences for user equipments (UEs), which is unrealistic given that the number of UEs exceeds the available orthogonal pilot sequences in CFmMIMO schemes. Moreover, most learning-based methods assume a fixed number of UEs, whereas the number of active UEs varies over time in practice. Additionally, supervised training necessitates costly computational resources for computing the target power control solutions for a large volume of training samples. To address these issues, we propose a graph attention network for downlink power control in CFmMIMO systems that operates in a self-supervised manner while effectively handling pilot contamination and adapting to a dynamic number of UEs. Experimental results show its effectiveness, even in comparison to the optimal accelerated projected gradient method as a baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-Informed Graph Neural Networks for Transverse Momentum Estimation in CMS Trigger Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19205v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time particle transverse momentum ($p_T$) estimation in high-energy physics demands algorithms that are both efficient and accurate under strict hardware constraints. Static machine learning models degrade under high pileup and lack physics-aware optimization, while generic graph neural networks (GNNs) often neglect domain structure critical for robust $p_T$ regression. We propose a physics-informed GNN framework that systematically encodes detector geometry and physical observables through four distinct graph construction strategies that systematically encode detector geometry and physical observables: station-as-node, feature-as-node, bending angle-centric, and pseudorapidity ($\eta$)-centric representations. This framework integrates these tailored graph structures with a novel Message Passing Layer (MPL), featuring intra-message attention and gated updates, and domain-specific loss functions incorporating $p_{T}$-distribution priors. Our co-design methodology yields superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to existing baselines. Extensive experiments on the CMS Trigger Dataset validate the approach: a station-informed EdgeConv model achieves a state-of-the-art MAE of 0.8525 with $\ge55\%$ fewer parameters than deep learning baselines, especially TabNet, while an $\eta$-centric MPL configuration also demonstrates improved accuracy with comparable efficiency. These results establish the promise of physics-guided GNNs for deployment in resource-constrained trigger systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Network-Based Predictor for Optimal Quantum Hardware Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19093v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing variety of quantum hardware technologies, each with unique peculiarities such as connectivity and native gate sets, creates challenges when selecting the best platform for executing a specific quantum circuit. This selection process usually involves a brute-force approach: compiling the circuit on various devices and evaluating performance based on factors such as circuit depth and gate fidelity. However, this method is computationally expensive and does not scale well as the number of available quantum processors increases. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based predictor that automates hardware selection by analyzing the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) representation of a quantum circuit. Our study evaluates 498 quantum circuits (up to 27 qubits) from the MQT Bench dataset, compiled using Qiskit on four devices: three superconducting quantum processors (IBM-Kyiv, IBM-Brisbane, IBM-Sherbrooke) and one trapped-ion processor (IONQ-Forte). Performance is estimated using a metric that integrates circuit depth and gate fidelity, resulting in a dataset where 93 circuits are optimally compiled on the trapped-ion device, while the remaining circuits prefer superconducting platforms. By exploiting graph-based machine learning, our approach avoids extracting the circuit features for the model evaluation but directly embeds it as a graph, significantly accelerating the optimal target decision-making process and maintaining all the information. Experimental results prove 94.4% accuracy and an 85.5% F1 score for the minority class, effectively predicting the best compilation target. The developed code is publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/antotu/GNN-Model-Quantum-Predictor).</p></details> |  |
| **[Mean flow data assimilation using physics-constrained Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09476v3)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their widespread use, purely data-driven methods often suffer from overfitting, lack of physical consistency, and high data dependency, particularly when physical constraints are not incorporated. This study introduces a novel data assimilation approach that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with optimisation techniques to enhance the accuracy of mean flow reconstruction, using Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations as a baseline. The method leverages the adjoint approach, incorporating RANS-derived gradients as optimisation terms during GNN training, ensuring that the learned model adheres to physical laws and maintains consistency. Additionally, the GNN framework is well-suited for handling unstructured data, which is common in the complex geometries encountered in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The GNN is interfaced with the Finite Element Method (FEM) for numerical simulations, enabling accurate modelling in unstructured domains. We consider the reconstruction of mean flow past bluff bodies at low Reynolds numbers as a test case, addressing tasks such as sparse data recovery, denoising, and inpainting of missing flow data. The key strengths of the approach lie in its integration of physical constraints into the GNN training process, leading to accurate predictions with limited data, making it particularly valuable when data are scarce or corrupted. Results demonstrate significant improvements in the accuracy of mean flow reconstructions, even with limited training data, compared to analogous purely data-driven models.</p></details> |  |
| **[PBiLoss: Popularity-Aware Regularization to Improve Fairness in Graph-Based Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19067v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems, especially those based on graph neural networks (GNNs), have achieved remarkable success in capturing user-item interaction patterns. However, they remain susceptible to popularity bias--the tendency to over-recommend popular items--resulting in reduced content diversity and compromised fairness. In this paper, we propose PBiLoss, a novel regularization-based loss function designed to counteract popularity bias in graph-based recommender models explicitly. PBiLoss augments traditional training objectives by penalizing the model's inclination toward popular items, thereby encouraging the recommendation of less popular but potentially more personalized content. We introduce two sampling strategies: Popular Positive (PopPos) and Popular Negative (PopNeg), which respectively modulate the contribution of the positive and negative popular items during training. We further explore two methods to distinguish popular items: one based on a fixed popularity threshold and another without any threshold, making the approach flexible and adaptive. Our proposed method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art graph-based frameworks such as LightGCN and its variants. Comprehensive experiments across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that PBiLoss significantly improves fairness, as demonstrated by reductions in the Popularity-Rank Correlation for Users (PRU) and Popularity-Rank Correlation for Items (PRI), while maintaining or even enhancing standard recommendation accuracy and ranking metrics. These results highlight the effectiveness of directly embedding fairness objectives into the optimization process, providing a practical and scalable solution for balancing accuracy and equitable content exposure in modern recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProGMLP: A Progressive Framework for GNN-to-MLP Knowledge Distillation with Efficient Trade-offs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19031v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GNN-to-MLP (G2M) methods have emerged as a promising approach to accelerate Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by distilling their knowledge into simpler Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). These methods bridge the gap between the expressive power of GNNs and the computational efficiency of MLPs, making them well-suited for resource-constrained environments. However, existing G2M methods are limited by their inability to flexibly adjust inference cost and accuracy dynamically, a critical requirement for real-world applications where computational resources and time constraints can vary significantly. To address this, we introduce a Progressive framework designed to offer flexible and on-demand trade-offs between inference cost and accuracy for GNN-to-MLP knowledge distillation (ProGMLP). ProGMLP employs a Progressive Training Structure (PTS), where multiple MLP students are trained in sequence, each building on the previous one. Furthermore, ProGMLP incorporates Progressive Knowledge Distillation (PKD) to iteratively refine the distillation process from GNNs to MLPs, and Progressive Mixup Augmentation (PMA) to enhance generalization by progressively generating harder mixed samples. Our approach is validated through comprehensive experiments on eight real-world graph datasets, demonstrating that ProGMLP maintains high accuracy while dynamically adapting to varying runtime scenarios, making it highly effective for deployment in diverse application settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric Multi-color Message Passing Graph Neural Networks for Blood-brain Barrier Permeability Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18926v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of blood-brain barrier permeability (BBBP) is essential for central nervous system (CNS) drug development. While graph neural networks (GNNs) have advanced molecular property prediction, they often rely on molecular topology and neglect the three-dimensional geometric information crucial for modeling transport mechanisms. This paper introduces the geometric multi-color message-passing graph neural network (GMC-MPNN), a novel framework that enhances standard message-passing architectures by explicitly incorporating atomic-level geometric features and long-range interactions. Our model constructs weighted colored subgraphs based on atom types to capture the spatial relationships and chemical context that govern BBB permeability. We evaluated GMC-MPNN on three benchmark datasets for both classification and regression tasks, using rigorous scaffold-based splitting to ensure a robust assessment of generalization. The results demonstrate that GMC-MPNN consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving superior performance in both classifying compounds as permeable/non-permeable (AUC-ROC of 0.9704 and 0.9685) and in regressing continuous permeability values (RMSE of 0.4609, Pearson correlation of 0.7759). An ablation study further quantified the impact of specific atom-pair interactions, revealing that the model's predictive power derives from its ability to learn from both common and rare, but chemically significant, functional motifs. By integrating spatial geometry into the graph representation, GMC-MPNN sets a new performance benchmark and offers a more accurate and generalizable tool for drug discovery pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[ThermoRL:Structure-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Protein Mutation Design to Enhance Thermostability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18816v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing mutations to optimize protein thermostability remains challenging due to the complex relationship between sequence variations, structural dynamics, and thermostability, often assessed by \delta\delta G (the change in free energy of unfolding). Existing methods rely on experimental random mutagenesis or prediction models tested with pre-defined datasets, using sequence-based heuristics and treating enzyme design as a one-step process without iterative refinement, which limits design space exploration and restricts discoveries beyond known variations. We present ThermoRL, a framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) that leverages graph neural networks (GNN) to design mutations with enhanced thermostability. It combines a pre-trained GNN-based encoder with a hierarchical Q-learning network and employs a surrogate model for reward feedback, guiding the RL agent on where (the position) and which (mutant amino acid) to apply for enhanced thermostability. Experimental results show that ThermoRL achieves higher or comparable rewards than baselines while maintaining computational efficiency. It filters out destabilizing mutations and identifies stabilizing mutations aligned with experimental data. Moreover, ThermoRL accurately detects key mutation sites in unseen proteins, highlighting its strong generalizability. This RL-guided approach powered by GNN embeddings offers a robust alternative to traditional protein mutation design.</p></details> |  |

While existing research on GNN robustness has primarily focused on software-level threats, hardware-induced faults and errors remain largely underexplored. As hardware systems progress toward advanced technology nodes to meet high-performance and energy efficiency demands, they become increasingly susceptible to transient faults, which can cause bit flips and silent data corruption, a prominent issue observed by major technology companies (e.g., Meta and Google). In response, we first present a comprehensive analysis of GNN robustness against bit-flip errors, aiming to reveal system-level optimization opportunities for future reliable and efficient GNN systems. Second, we propose Ralts, a generalizable and lightweight solution to bolster GNN resilience to bit-flip errors. Specifically, Ralts exploits various graph similarity metrics to filter out outliers and recover compromised graph topology, and incorporates these protective techniques directly into aggregation functions to support any message-passing GNNs. Evaluation results demonstrate that Ralts effectively enhances GNN robustness across a range of GNN models, graph datasets, error patterns, and both dense and sparse architectures. On average, under a BER of $3\times10^{-5}$, these robust aggregation functions improve prediction accuracy by at least 20\% when errors present in model weights or node embeddings, and by at least 10\% when errors occur in adjacency matrices. Ralts is also optimized to deliver execution efficiency comparable to built-in aggregation functions in PyTorch Geometric.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resolving Indirect Calls in Binary Code via Cross-Reference Augmented Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18801v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary code analysis is essential in scenarios where source code is unavailable, with extensive applications across various security domains. However, accurately resolving indirect call targets remains a longstanding challenge in maintaining the integrity of static analysis in binary code. This difficulty arises because the operand of a call instruction (e.g., call rax) remains unknown until runtime, resulting in an incomplete inter-procedural control flow graph (CFG). Previous approaches have struggled with low accuracy and limited scalability. To address these limitations, recent work has increasingly turned to machine learning (ML) to enhance analysis. However, this ML-driven approach faces two significant obstacles: low-quality callsite-callee training pairs and inadequate binary code representation, both of which undermine the accuracy of ML models. In this paper, we introduce NeuCall, a novel approach for resolving indirect calls using graph neural networks. Existing ML models in this area often overlook key elements such as data and code cross-references, which are essential for understanding a program's control flow. In contrast, NeuCall augments CFGs with cross-references, preserving rich semantic information. Additionally, we leverage advanced compiler-level type analysis to generate high-quality callsite-callee training pairs, enhancing model precision and reliability. We further design a graph neural model that leverages augmented CFGs and relational graph convolutions for accurate target prediction. Evaluated against real-world binaries from GitHub and the Arch User Repository on x86_64 architecture, NeuCall achieves an F1 score of 95.2%, outperforming state-of-the-art ML-based approaches. These results highlight NeuCall's effectiveness in building precise inter-procedural CFGs and its potential to advance downstream binary analysis and security applications.</p></details> |  |

This limitation arises from indiscriminate neighbor aggregation and insufficient incorporation of higher-order structural patterns. To address these challenges, we propose GLANCE (Graph Logic Attention Network with Cluster Enhancement), a novel framework that integrates logic-guided reasoning, dynamic graph refinement, and adaptive clustering to enhance graph representation learning. GLANCE combines a logic layer for interpretable and structured embeddings, multi-head attention-based edge pruning for denoising graph structures, and clustering mechanisms for capturing global patterns. Experimental results in benchmark datasets, including Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin, demonstrate that GLANCE achieves competitive performance, offering robust and interpretable solutions for heterophilous graph scenarios. The proposed framework is lightweight, adaptable, and uniquely suited to the challenges of heterophilous graphs.</p></details> |  |

In particular, limited-area model (LAM) and stretched-grid model (SGM) approaches have emerged for generating high-resolution regional forecasts, based on initial conditions from a regional (re)analysis. While LAM uses lateral boundaries from an external global model, SGM incorporates a global domain at lower resolution. This study aims to understand how the differences in model design impact relative performance and potential applications. Specifically, the strengths and weaknesses of these two approaches are identified for generating deterministic regional forecasts over Europe. Using the Anemoi framework, models of both types are built by minimally adapting a shared architecture and trained using global and regional reanalyses in a near-identical setup. Several inference experiments have been conducted to explore their relative performance and highlight key differences. Results show that both LAM and SGM are competitive deterministic MLWP models with generally accurate and comparable forecasting performance over the regional domain. Various differences were identified in the performance of the models across applications. LAM is able to successfully exploit high-quality boundary forcings to make predictions within the regional domain and is suitable in contexts where global data is difficult to acquire. SGM is fully self-contained for easier operationalisation, can take advantage of more training data and significantly surpasses LAM in terms of (temporal) generalisability. Our paper can serve as a starting point for meteorological institutes to guide their choice between LAM and SGM in developing an operational data-driven forecasting system.</p></details> |  |

However, the complexity of simulating quantum systems poses a significant challenge to computer-aided design of quantum chips, especially for large-scale chips. Harnessing the scalability of graph neural networks (GNNs), we here propose a parameter designing algorithm for large-scale superconducting quantum circuits. The algorithm depends on the so-called 'three-stair scaling' mechanism, which comprises two neural-network models: an evaluator supervisedly trained on small-scale circuits for applying to medium-scale circuits, and a designer unsupervisedly trained on medium-scale circuits for applying to large-scale ones. We demonstrate our algorithm in mitigating quantum crosstalk errors. Frequencies for both single- and two-qubit gates (corresponding to the parameters of nodes and edges) are considered simultaneously. Numerical results indicate that the well-trained designer achieves notable advantages in efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability. For example, for large-scale superconducting quantum circuits consisting of around 870 qubits, our GNNs-based algorithm achieves 51% of the errors produced by the state-of-the-art algorithm, with a time reduction from 90 min to 27 sec. Overall, a better-performing and more scalable algorithm for designing parameters of superconducting quantum chips is proposed, which initially demonstrates the advantages of applying GNNs in superconducting quantum chips.</p></details> |  |
| **[Logical Characterizations of GNNs with Mean Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18145v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) with mean as the aggregation function. In the non-uniform setting, we show that such GNNs have exactly the same expressive power as ratio modal logic, which has modal operators expressing that at least a certain ratio of the successors of a vertex satisfies a specified property. The non-uniform expressive power of mean GNNs is thus higher than that of GNNs with max aggregation, but lower than for sum aggregation--the latter are characterized by modal logic and graded modal logic, respectively. In the uniform setting, we show that the expressive power relative to MSO is exactly that of alternation-free modal logic, under the natural assumptions that combination functions are continuous and classification functions are thresholds. This implies that, relative to MSO and in the uniform setting, mean GNNs are strictly less expressive than sum GNNs and max GNNs. When any of the assumptions is dropped, the expressive power increases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Knowledge Tracing Leveraging Higher-Order Information in Integrated Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18668v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of online learning has led to the development of various knowledge tracing (KT) methods. However, existing methods have overlooked the problem of increasing computational cost when utilizing large graphs and long learning sequences. To address this issue, we introduce Dual Graph Attention-based Knowledge Tracing (DGAKT), a graph neural network model designed to leverage high-order information from subgraphs representing student-exercise-KC relationships. DGAKT incorporates a subgraph-based approach to enhance computational efficiency. By processing only relevant subgraphs for each target interaction, DGAKT significantly reduces memory and computational requirements compared to full global graph models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DGAKT not only outperforms existing KT models but also sets a new standard in resource efficiency, addressing a critical need that has been largely overlooked by prior KT approaches.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a novel multimodal approach, the Long-Short Distance Graph Neural Network (LSDGNN). Based on the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), it constructs a long-distance graph neural network and a short-distance graph neural network to obtain multimodal features of distant and nearby utterances, respectively. To ensure that long- and short-distance features are as distinct as possible in representation while enabling mutual influence between the two modules, we employ a Differential Regularizer and incorporate a BiAffine Module to facilitate feature interaction. In addition, we propose an Improved Curriculum Learning (ICL) to address the challenge of data imbalance. By computing the similarity between different emotions to emphasize the shifts in similar emotions, we design a "weighted emotional shift" metric and develop a difficulty measurer, enabling a training process that prioritizes learning easy samples before harder ones. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[ViGText: Deepfake Image Detection with Vision-Language Model Explanations and Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18031v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid rise of deepfake technology, which produces realistic but fraudulent digital content, threatens the authenticity of media. Traditional deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes. Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes, helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Locate: GNN-Powered Vulnerability Path Discovery in Open Source Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17888v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting security vulnerabilities in open-source software is a critical task that is highly regarded in the related research communities. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature for detecting vulnerable codes and identifying the classes of vulnerabilities. However, there is still room to work in explaining the root causes of detected vulnerabilities through locating vulnerable statements and the discovery of paths leading to the activation of the vulnerability. While frameworks like SliceLocator offer explanations by identifying vulnerable paths, they rely on rule-based sink identification that limits their generalization. In this paper, we introduce VulPathFinder, an explainable vulnerability path discovery framework that enhances SliceLocator's methodology by utilizing a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) model for detecting sink statements, rather than relying on predefined rules. The proposed GNN captures semantic and syntactic dependencies to find potential sink points (PSPs), which are candidate statements where vulnerable paths end. After detecting PSPs, program slicing can be used to extract potentially vulnerable paths, which are then ranked by feeding them back into the target graph-based detector. Ultimately, the most probable path is returned, explaining the root cause of the detected vulnerability. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach by performing evaluations on a benchmark of the buffer overflow CWEs from the SARD dataset, providing explanations for the corresponding detected vulnerabilities. The results show that VulPathFinder outperforms both original SliceLocator and GNNExplainer (as a general GNN explainability tool) in discovery of vulnerability paths to identified PSPs.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 Figures |
| **[Towards Effective Open-set Graph Class-incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17687v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph class-incremental learning (GCIL) allows graph neural networks (GNNs) to adapt to evolving graph analytical tasks by incrementally learning new class knowledge while retaining knowledge of old classes. Existing GCIL methods primarily focus on a closed-set assumption, where all test samples are presumed to belong to previously known classes. Such an assumption restricts their applicability in real-world scenarios, where unknown classes naturally emerge during inference, and are absent during training. In this paper, we explore a more challenging open-set graph class-incremental learning scenario with two intertwined challenges: catastrophic forgetting of old classes, which impairs the detection of unknown classes, and inadequate open-set recognition, which destabilizes the retention of learned knowledge. To address the above problems, a novel OGCIL framework is proposed, which utilizes pseudo-sample embedding generation to effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting and enable robust detection of unknown classes. To be specific, a prototypical conditional variational autoencoder is designed to synthesize node embeddings for old classes, enabling knowledge replay without storing raw graph data. To handle unknown classes, we employ a mixing-based strategy to generate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples from pseudo in-distribution and current node embeddings. A novel prototypical hypersphere classification loss is further proposed, which anchors in-distribution embeddings to their respective class prototypes, while repelling OOD embeddings away. Instead of assigning all unknown samples into one cluster, our proposed objective function explicitly models them as outliers through prototype-aware rejection regions, ensuring a robust open-set recognition. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of OGCIL over existing GCIL and open-set GNN methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 33rd ACM International Conference on Multimedia (MM 2025)</p></details> |

The lattice geometry is encoded as a graph and processed by a graph neural network (GNN) followed by fully connected layers. The model is trained on Monte Carlo simulation data and accurately reproduces key features of the magnetization curve, including plateaus, critical transition points, and the effects of geometric frustration. It captures both local motifs and global symmetries, demonstrating that GNNs can infer magnetic behavior directly from structural connectivity. The proposed approach enables efficient prediction of magnetization without the need for additional Monte Carlo simulations.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures |

We model such process by an interacting particle system with attractive and repulsive forces and the Allen-Cahn force arising in the modeling of phase transition. The dynamics of the system is a reaction-diffusion process which can separate particles without blowing up. This induces an Allen-Cahn message passing (ACMP) for graph neural networks where the numerical iteration for the particle system solution constitutes the message passing propagation. ACMP which has a simple implementation with a neural ODE solver can propel the network depth up to one hundred of layers with theoretically proven strictly positive lower bound of the Dirichlet energy. It thus provides a deep model of GNNs circumventing the common GNN problem of oversmoothing. GNNs with ACMP achieve state of the art performance for real-world node classification tasks on both homophilic and heterophilic datasets.

To enhance handover (HO) performance, 3GPP introduced Conditional Handover (CHO) and Layer 1/Layer 2 Triggered Mobility (LTM) mechanisms in 5G. While these reactive HO strategies address the trade-off between HO failures (HOF) and ping-pong effects, they often result in inefficient radio resource utilization due to additional HO preparations. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes a proactive HO framework for mobility management in O-RAN, leveraging user-cell link predictions to identify the optimal target cell for HO. We explore various categories of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for link prediction and analyze the complexity of applying them to the mobility management domain. Two GNN models are compared using a real-world dataset, with experimental results demonstrating their ability to capture the dynamic and graph-structured nature of cellular networks. Finally, we present key insights from our study and outline future steps to enable the integration of GNN-based link prediction for mobility management in O-RAN networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 1 table.

Our approach leverages a graph neural network trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to efficiently estimate the robot's cost-to-go, formulated as local goal recommendations. A spatio-temporal path-searching module, which accounts for kinematic constraints, is then employed to generate a reference trajectory to facilitate solving the non-convex optimization problem used for explicit constraint enforcement. More importantly, we introduce an incremental action-masking mechanism and a privileged learning strategy, enabling end-to-end training of the proposed planner. Both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively addresses local planning in complex dynamic environments, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Compared with existing learning-optimization hybrid methods, our approach eliminates the dependency on high-fidelity simulation environments, offering significant advantages in computational efficiency and training scalability. The code will be released as open-source upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce TwiUSD, the first large-scale, manually annotated UserSD benchmark with explicit followee relationships, containing 16,211 users and 47,757 tweets. TwiUSD enables rigorous evaluation of stance models by integrating tweet content and social links, with superior scale and annotation quality. Building on this resource, we propose MRFG: a structure-aware framework that uses LLM-based relevance filtering and feature routing to address noise and context heterogeneity. MRFG employs multi-scale filtering and adaptively routes features through graph neural networks or multi-layer perceptrons based on topological informativeness. Experiments show MRFG consistently outperforms strong baselines (including PLMs, graph-based models, and LLM prompting) in both in-target and cross-target evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[HypoChainer: A Collaborative System Combining LLMs and Knowledge Graphs for Hypothesis-Driven Scientific Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17209v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern scientific discovery faces growing challenges in integrating vast and heterogeneous knowledge critical to breakthroughs in biomedicine and drug development. Traditional hypothesis-driven research, though effective, is constrained by human cognitive limits, the complexity of biological systems, and the high cost of trial-and-error experimentation. Deep learning models, especially graph neural networks (GNNs), have accelerated prediction generation, but the sheer volume of outputs makes manual selection for validation unscalable. Large language models (LLMs) offer promise in filtering and hypothesis generation, yet suffer from hallucinations and lack grounding in structured knowledge, limiting their reliability. To address these issues, we propose HypoChainer, a collaborative visualization framework that integrates human expertise, LLM-driven reasoning, and knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance hypothesis generation and validation. HypoChainer operates in three stages: First, exploration and contextualization -- experts use retrieval-augmented LLMs (RAGs) and dimensionality reduction to navigate large-scale GNN predictions, assisted by interactive explanations. Second, hypothesis chain formation -- experts iteratively examine KG relationships around predictions and semantically linked entities, refining hypotheses with LLM and KG suggestions. Third, validation prioritization -- refined hypotheses are filtered based on KG-supported evidence to identify high-priority candidates for experimentation, with visual analytics further strengthening weak links in reasoning. We demonstrate HypoChainer's effectiveness through case studies in two domains and expert interviews, highlighting its potential to support interpretable, scalable, and knowledge-grounded scientific discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks Gone Hogwild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00494v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) appear to be powerful tools to learn state representations for agents in distributed, decentralized multi-agent systems, but generate catastrophically incorrect predictions when nodes update asynchronously during inference. This failure under asynchrony effectively excludes these architectures from many potential applications where synchrony is difficult or impossible to enforce, e.g., robotic swarms or sensor networks. In this work we identify "implicitly-defined" GNNs as a class of architectures which is provably robust to asynchronous "hogwild" inference, adapting convergence guarantees from work in asynchronous and distributed optimization. We then propose a novel implicitly-defined GNN architecture, which we call an 'energy GNN'. We show that this architecture outperforms other GNNs from this class on a variety of synthetic tasks inspired by multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |

However, despite extensive benchmarking efforts, it remains unclear whether current Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) effectively capture core temporal patterns such as periodicity, cause-and-effect, and long-range dependencies. In this work, we introduce the Temporal Graph Reasoning Benchmark (T-GRAB), a comprehensive set of synthetic tasks designed to systematically probe the capabilities of TGNNs to reason across time. T-GRAB provides controlled, interpretable tasks that isolate key temporal skills: counting/memorizing periodic repetitions, inferring delayed causal effects, and capturing long-range dependencies over both spatial and temporal dimensions. We evaluate 11 temporal graph learning methods on these tasks, revealing fundamental shortcomings in their ability to generalize temporal patterns. Our findings offer actionable insights into the limitations of current models, highlight challenges hidden by traditional real-world benchmarks, and motivate the development of architectures with stronger temporal reasoning abilities.

Addressing this challenge, we present a novel variational network, a model-based learning paradigm that strategically merges the advantages and interpretability of classical iterative reconstruction with the power of deep learning. This approach integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) within the iterative Proximal Regularized Gauss Newton (PRGN) framework. By unrolling the PRGN algorithm, where each iteration corresponds to a network layer, we leverage the physical insights of nonlinear model fitting alongside the GNN's capacity to capture inter-frequency correlations. Notably, the GNN architecture preserves the irregular triangular mesh structure used in the solution of the nonlinear forward model, enabling accurate reconstruction of overlapping tissue fraction concentrations.</p></details> |  |

In particular, we are interested in learning distributed optimal controllers using graph recurrent neural networks (GRNNs). Most of the existing approaches result in centralized optimal controllers with offline training processes. However, as the increasing demand of network resilience, the optimal controllers are further expected to be distributed, and are desirable to be trained in an online distributed fashion, which are also the main contributions of our work. To solve this problem, we first propose a GRNN-based distributed optimal control method, and we cast the problem as a self-supervised learning problem. Then, the distributed online training is achieved via distributed gradient computation, and inspired by the (consensus-based) distributed optimization idea, a distributed online training optimizer is designed. Furthermore, the local closed-loop stability of the linear networked system under our proposed GRNN-based controller is provided by assuming that the nonlinear activation function of the GRNN-based controller is both local sector-bounded and slope-restricted. The effectiveness of our proposed method is illustrated by numerical simulations using a specifically developed simulator.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Yet, existing methods are unsuitable for routing on multigraphs, which feature multiple edges with distinct attributes between node pairs, despite their strong relevance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose two graph neural network-based methods to address multi-objective routing on multigraphs. Our first approach operates directly on the multigraph by autoregressively selecting edges until a tour is completed. The second model first simplifies the multigraph via a learned pruning strategy and then performs routing on the resulting simple graph. We evaluate both models empirically and demonstrate their strong performance across a range of problems and distributions.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 Figures |

This study compared performances of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GINs), applied to 7 different toxicological assay datasets of varying data abundance and endpoint, to perform binary classification of assay activation. Following pre-processing of molecular graphs, enforcement of class-balance and stratification of all datasets across 5 folds, Bayesian optimisations were carried out, for each GNN applied to each assay dataset (resulting in 21 unique Bayesian optimisations). Optimised GNNs performed at Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores ranging from 0.728-0.849 (averaged across all folds), naturally varying between specific assays and GNNs. GINs were found to consistently outperform GCNs and GATs, for the top 5 of 7 most data-abundant toxicological assays. GATs however significantly outperformed over the remaining 2 most data-scarce assays. This indicates that GINs are a more optimal architecture for data-abundant environments, whereas GATs are a more optimal architecture for data-scarce environments. Subsequent analysis of the explored higher-dimensional hyperparameter spaces, as well as optimised hyperparameter states, found that GCNs and GATs reached measurably closer optimised states with each other, compared to GINs, further indicating the unique nature of GINs as a GNN algorithm.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a Knowledge-aware Diffusion-Enhanced architecture using contrastive learning paradigms (KDiffE) for multimedia recommendations. Specifically, we first utilize original user-item graphs to build an attention-aware matrix into graph neural networks, which can learn the importance between users and items for main view construction. The attention-aware matrix is constructed by adopting a random walk with a restart strategy, which can preserve the importance between users and items to generate aggregation of attention-aware node features. Then, we propose a guided diffusion model to generate strongly task-relevant knowledge graphs with less noise for constructing a knowledge-aware contrastive view, which utilizes user embeddings with an edge connected to an item to guide the generation of strongly task-relevant knowledge graphs for enhancing the item's semantic information. We perform comprehensive experiments on three multimedia datasets that reveal the effectiveness of our KDiffE and its components on various state-of-the-art methods.

Predicting the accuracy of circuits composed of approximate components without performing complete synthesis remains a challenging problem. Current machine learning approaches used to automate this task require retraining for each new circuit configuration, making them computationally expensive and time-consuming. This paper presents ApproxGNN, a construction methodology for a pre-trained graph neural network model predicting QoR and HW cost of approximate accelerators employing approximate adders from a library. This approach is applicable in DSE for assignment of approximate components to operations in accelerator. Our approach introduces novel component feature extraction based on learned embeddings rather than traditional error metrics, enabling improved transferability to unseen circuits. ApproxGNN models can be trained with a small number of approximate components, supports transfer to multiple prediction tasks, utilizes precomputed embeddings for efficiency, and significantly improves accuracy of the prediction of approximation error. On a set of image convolutional filters, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed embeddings improve prediction accuracy (mean square error) by 50% compared to conventional methods. Furthermore, the overall prediction accuracy is 30% better than statistical machine learning approaches without fine-tuning and 54% better with fast finetuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at ICCAD 2025</p></details> |

However, this process is usually slow and expensive, especially for metallic glasses, whose formation strongly depends on the optimal combinations of multiple elements to resist crystallization. This constraint renders only several thousands of candidates explored in the vast material space since 1960. Recently, data-driven approaches armed by advanced machine learning techniques provided alternative routes for intelligent materials design. Due to data scarcity and immature material encoding, the conventional tabular data is usually mined by statistical learning algorithms, giving limited model predictability and generalizability. Here, we propose sophisticated data learning from material network representations. The node elements are encoded from the Wikipedia by a language model. Graph neural networks with versatile architectures are designed to serve as recommendation systems to explore hidden relationships among materials. By employing Wikipedia embeddings from different languages, we assess the capability of natural languages in materials design.

This assumption does not hold in many real-world heterophilic graphs. Existing models for heterophilic graphs primarily rely on pairwise relationships, overlooking multi-scale information from higher-order structures. This leads to suboptimal performance, particularly under noise from conflicting class information across nodes. To address these challenges, we propose HPGNN, a novel model integrating Higher-order Personalized PageRank with Graph Neural Networks. HPGNN introduces an efficient high-order approximation of Personalized PageRank (PPR) to capture long-range and multi-scale node interactions. This approach reduces computational complexity and mitigates noise from surrounding information. By embedding higher-order structural information into convolutional networks, HPGNN effectively models key interactions across diverse graph dimensions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate HPGNN's effectiveness. The model achieves better performance than five out of seven state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs in downstream tasks while maintaining competitive performance on homophilic graphs. HPGNN's ability to balance multi-scale information and robustness to noise makes it a versatile solution for real-world graph learning challenges.

Bardhan et al., Machine learning-enhanced search for a vectorlike singlet B quark decaying to a singlet scalar or pseudoscalar, Phys. Rev. D 107 (2023) 115001; arXiv:2212.02442], we investigate the LHC prospects of pair-produced vectorlike $B$ quarks decaying exotically to a new gauge-singlet (pseudo)scalar field $\Phi$ and a $b$ quark. After the electroweak symmetry breaking, the $\Phi$ decays predominantly to $gg/bb$ final states, leading to a fully hadronic $2b+4j$ or $6b$ signature. Because of the large Standard Model background and the lack of leptonic handles, it is a difficult channel to probe. To overcome the challenge, we employ a hybrid deep learning model containing a graph neural network followed by a deep neural network.

While existing graph neural network (GNN) approaches have made significant progress in capturing complex product relationships, they often struggle with the accuracy-diversity tradeoff, particularly for long-tail items. This paper introduces a model-agnostic approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the reranking of complementary product recommendations. Unlike previous works that use LLMs primarily for data preprocessing and graph augmentation, our method applies LLM-based prompting strategies directly to rerank candidate items retrieved from existing recommendation models, eliminating the need for model retraining. Through extensive experiments on public datasets, we demonstrate that our approach effectively balances accuracy and diversity in complementary product recommendations, with at least 50% lift in accuracy metrics and 2% lift in diversity metrics on average for the top recommended items across datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[BioGraphFusion: Graph Knowledge Embedding for Biological Completion and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14468v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivation: Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) are crucial for drug discovery and disease understanding, yet their completion and reasoning are challenging. Knowledge Embedding (KE) methods capture global semantics but struggle with dynamic structural integration, while Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel locally but often lack semantic understanding. Even ensemble approaches, including those leveraging language models, often fail to achieve a deep, adaptive, and synergistic co-evolution between semantic comprehension and structural learning. Addressing this critical gap in fostering continuous, reciprocal refinement between these two aspects in complex biomedical KGs is paramount. Results: We introduce BioGraphFusion, a novel framework for deeply synergistic semantic and structural learning. BioGraphFusion establishes a global semantic foundation via tensor decomposition, guiding an LSTM-driven mechanism to dynamically refine relation embeddings during graph propagation. This fosters adaptive interplay between semantic understanding and structural learning, further enhanced by query-guided subgraph construction and a hybrid scoring mechanism. Experiments across three key biomedical tasks demonstrate BioGraphFusion's superior performance over state-of-the-art KE, GNN, and ensemble models. A case study on Cutaneous Malignant Melanoma 1 (CMM1) highlights its ability to unveil biologically meaningful pathways.

| **[Feature Construction Using Network Control Theory and Rank Encoding for Graph Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15195v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we utilize the concept of average controllability in graphs, along with a novel rank encoding method, to enhance the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in social network classification tasks. GNNs have proven highly effective in various network-based learning applications and require some form of node features to function. However, their performance is heavily influenced by the expressiveness of these features. In social networks, node features are often unavailable due to privacy constraints or the absence of inherent attributes, making it challenging for GNNs to achieve optimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose two strategies for constructing expressive node features. First, we introduce average controllability along with other centrality metrics (denoted as NCT-EFA) as node-level metrics that capture critical aspects of network topology. Building on this, we develop a rank encoding method that transforms average controllability or any other graph-theoretic metric into a fixed-dimensional feature space, thereby improving feature representation. We conduct extensive numerical evaluations using six benchmark GNN models across four social network datasets to compare different node feature construction methods. Our results demonstrate that incorporating average controllability into the feature space significantly improves GNN performance. Moreover, the proposed rank encoding method outperforms traditional one-hot degree encoding, improving the ROC AUC from 68.7% to 73.9% using GraphSAGE on the GitHub Stargazers dataset, underscoring its effectiveness in generating expressive and efficient node representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Task Planning with Neuro-Symbolic Relaxation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15975v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world task planning requires long-horizon reasoning over large sets of entities with complex relationships and attributes, leading to a combinatorial explosion for classical symbolic planners. To prune the search space, recent methods prioritize searching on a simplified task only containing a few "important" entities predicted by a neural network. However, such a simple neuro-symbolic (NeSy) integration risks omitting critical entities and wasting resources on unsolvable simplified tasks. To enable Fast and reliable planning, we introduce a NeSy relaxation strategy (Flax), combining neural importance prediction with symbolic expansion. Specifically, we first learn a graph neural network to predict entity importance to create a simplified task and solve it with a symbolic planner. Then, we solve a rule-relaxed task to obtain a quick rough plan, and reintegrate all referenced entities into the simplified task to recover any overlooked but essential elements. Finally, we apply complementary rules to refine the updated task, keeping it both reliable and compact. Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world maze navigation benchmarks where a robot must traverse through a maze and interact with movable objects. The results show that Flax boosts the average success rate by 20.82% and cuts mean wall-clock planning time by 17.65% compared with the state-of-the-art NeSy baseline. We expect that Flax offers a practical path toward fast, scalable, long-horizon task planning in complex environments.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Graph Attention Specialized Expert Fusion Model for Node Classification: Based on Cora and Pubmed Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15784v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph node classification is a fundamental task in graph neural networks (GNNs), aiming to assign predefined class labels to nodes. On the PubMed citation network dataset, we observe significant classification difficulty disparities, with Category 2 achieving only 74.4% accuracy in traditional GCN, 7.5% lower than Category 1. To address this, we propose a Wasserstein-Rubinstein (WR) distance enhanced Expert Fusion Model (WR-EFM), training specialized GNN models for Categories 0/1 (with layer normalization and residual connections) and Multi-hop Graph Attention Networks (GAT) for Category 2. The WR distance metric optimizes representation similarity between models, particularly focusing on improving Category 2 performance. Our adaptive fusion strategy dynamically weights models based on category-specific performance, with Category 2 assigned a GAT weight of 0.8. WR distance further guides the fusion process by measuring distributional differences between model representations, enabling more principled integration of complementary features. Experimental results show WR-EFM achieves balanced accuracy across categories: 77.8% (Category 0), 78.0% (Category 1), and 79.9% (Category 2), outperforming both single models and standard fusion approaches. The coefficient of variation (CV) of WR-EFM's category accuracies is 0.013, 77.6% lower than GCN's 0.058, demonstrating superior stability. Notably, WR-EFM improves Category 2 accuracy by 5.5% compared to GCN, verifying the effectiveness of WR-guided fusion in capturing complex structural patterns. This work provides a novel paradigm for handling class-imbalanced graph classification tasks. To promote the research community, we release our project at https://github.com/s010m00n/GASEM4NC.</p></details> |  |
| **[BrainNetMLP: An Efficient and Effective Baseline for Functional Brain Network Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11538v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have made great progress in functional brain network classification by modeling the brain as a network of Regions of Interest (ROIs) and leveraging their connections to understand brain functionality and diagnose mental disorders. Various deep learning architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks, Graph Neural Networks, and the recent Transformer, have been developed. However, despite the increasing complexity of these models, the performance gain has not been as salient. This raises a question: Does increasing model complexity necessarily lead to higher classification accuracy? In this paper, we revisit the simplest deep learning architecture, the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and propose a pure MLP-based method, named BrainNetMLP, for functional brain network classification, which capitalizes on the advantages of MLP, including efficient computation and fewer parameters. Moreover, BrainNetMLP incorporates a dual-branch structure to jointly capture both spatial connectivity and spectral information, enabling precise spatiotemporal feature fusion. We evaluate our proposed BrainNetMLP on two public and popular brain network classification datasets, the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE). Experimental results demonstrate pure MLP-based methods can achieve state-of-the-art performance, revealing the potential of MLP-based models as more efficient yet effective alternatives in functional brain network classification.

However, LLMs, despite their general reasoning power, struggle significantly in specialized, data-sensitive tasks such as designing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This difficulty arises from (1) the inherent knowledge gaps in modeling the intricate, varying relationships between graph properties and suitable architectures and (2) the external noise from misleading descriptive inputs, often resulting in generic or even misleading model suggestions. Achieving proficiency in designing data-aware models -- defined as the meta-level capability to systematically accumulate, interpret, and apply data-specific design knowledge -- remains challenging for existing automated approaches, due to their inefficient construction and application of meta-knowledge. To achieve the meta-level proficiency, we propose DesiGNN, a knowledge-centered framework that systematically converts past model design experiences into structured, fine-grained knowledge priors well fitted to meta-learning with LLMs. To account for the inherent variability and external noise, DesiGNN aligns empirical property filtering from extensive benchmarks with adaptive elicitation of literature insights via LLMs. By constructing a solid meta-knowledge between unseen graph understanding and known effective architecture patterns, DesiGNN can deliver top-5.77% initial model proposals for unseen datasets within seconds, and achieve consistently superior performance with minimal search costs against baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variational Mode-Driven Graph Convolutional Network for Spatiotemporal Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16191v3)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on spatiotemporal (ST) traffic prediction using graph neural networks (GNNs). Given that ST data comprises non-stationary and complex temporal patterns, interpreting and predicting such trends is inherently challenging. Representing ST data in decomposed modes helps infer underlying behavior and assess the impact of noise on predictive performance. We propose a framework that decomposes ST data into interpretable modes using variational mode decomposition (VMD) and processes them through a neural network for future state forecasting. Unlike existing graph-based traffic forecasters that operate directly on raw or aggregated time series, the proposed hybrid approach, termed the Variational Mode Graph Convolutional Network (VMGCN), first decomposes non-stationary signals into interpretable variational modes by determining the optimal mode count via reconstruction-loss minimization and then learns both intramode and cross-mode spatiotemporal dependencies through a novel attention-augmented GCN. Additionally, we analyze the significance of each mode and the effect of bandwidth constraints on multi-horizon traffic flow predictions. The proposed two-stage design yields significant accuracy gains while providing frequency-level interpretability with demonstrated superior performance on the LargeST dataset for both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks. The implementation is publicly available on https://github.com/OsamaAhmad369/VMGCN.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM T...</summary><p>ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST) Submission, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Demand Prediction for Food Delivery Using Attention-Driven Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15246v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate demand forecasting is critical for enhancing the efficiency and responsiveness of food delivery platforms, where spatial heterogeneity and temporal fluctuations in order volumes directly influence operational decisions. This paper proposes an attention-based Graph Neural Network framework that captures spatial-temporal dependencies by modeling the food delivery environment as a graph. In this graph, nodes represent urban delivery zones, while edges reflect spatial proximity and inter-regional order flow patterns derived from historical data. The attention mechanism dynamically weighs the influence of neighboring zones, enabling the model to focus on the most contextually relevant areas during prediction. Temporal trends are jointly learned alongside spatial interactions, allowing the model to adapt to evolving demand patterns. Extensive experiments on real-world food delivery datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in forecasting future order volumes with high accuracy. The framework offers a scalable and adaptive solution to support proactive fleet positioning, resource allocation, and dispatch optimization in urban food delivery operations.</p></details> |  |

An Agent-Based Simulation of Human Mobility in a Futuristic Smart City](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15143v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the feasibility of human mobility in The Line, a proposed 170-kilometer linear smart city in NEOM, Saudi Arabia. To assess whether citizens can move freely within this unprecedented urban topology, we develop a hybrid simulation framework that integrates agent-based modeling, reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and graph neural networks. The simulation captures multi-modal transportation behaviors across 50 vertical levels and varying density scenarios using both synthetic data and real-world traces from high-density cities. Our experiments reveal that with the full AI-integrated architecture, agents achieved an average commute time of 7.8 to 8.4 minutes, a satisfaction rate exceeding 89 percent, and a reachability index of over 91 percent, even during peak congestion periods. Ablation studies confirmed that the removal of intelligent modules such as reinforcement learning or graph neural networks significantly degrades performance, with commute times increasing by up to 85 percent and reachability falling below 70 percent. Environmental modeling further demonstrated low energy consumption and minimal CO2 emissions when electric modes are prioritized. The findings suggest that freedom of movement is not only conceptually achievable in The Line, but also operationally realistic if supported by adaptive AI systems, sustainable infrastructure, and real-time feedback loops.</p></details> |  |

However, their applications have been limited primarily to small-scale datasets because of memory constraints. While distributed training offers a solution, current frameworks lack support for spatiotemporal models and overlook the properties of spatiotemporal data. Informed by a scaling study on a large-scale workload, we present PyTorch Geometric Temporal Index (PGT-I), an extension to PyTorch Geometric Temporal that integrates distributed data parallel training and two novel strategies: index-batching and distributed-index-batching. Our index techniques exploit spatiotemporal structure to construct snapshots dynamically at runtime, significantly reducing memory overhead, while distributed-index-batching extends this approach by enabling scalable processing across multiple GPUs. Our techniques enable the first-ever training of an ST-GNN on the entire PeMS dataset without graph partitioning, reducing peak memory usage by up to 89% and achieving up to a 11.78x speedup over standard DDP with 128 GPUs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the 2025 International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis</p></details> |

Through comparative experiments, we quantitatively assess performance differences between traditional algorithms and GNNs in node classification and clustering tasks.

These difficulties stem from iterative message-passing techniques, which place significant computational demands and require extensive GPU memory, particularly when dealing with the neighbor explosion issue inherent in large-scale graphs. This paper introduces a scalable, low-cost, flexible, and efficient GNN framework called LPS-GNN, which can perform representation learning on 100 billion graphs with a single GPU in 10 hours and shows a 13.8% improvement in User Acquisition scenarios. We examine existing graph partitioning methods and design a superior graph partition algorithm named LPMetis. In particular, LPMetis outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on various evaluation metrics. In addition, our paper proposes a subgraph augmentation strategy to enhance the model's predictive performance. It exhibits excellent compatibility, allowing the entire framework to accommodate various GNN algorithms. Successfully deployed on the Tencent platform, LPS-GNN has been tested on public and real-world datasets, achieving performance lifts of 8. 24% to 13. 89% over SOTA models in online applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable Graph Neural Networks via Structural Externalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17848v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved outstanding performance across a wide range of graph-related tasks. However, their "black-box" nature poses significant challenges to their explainability, and existing methods often fail to effectively capture the intricate interaction patterns among nodes within the network. In this work, we propose a novel explainability framework, GraphEXT, which leverages cooperative game theory and the concept of social externalities. GraphEXT partitions graph nodes into coalitions, decomposing the original graph into independent subgraphs. By integrating graph structure as an externality and incorporating the Shapley value under externalities, GraphEXT quantifies node importance through their marginal contributions to GNN predictions as the nodes transition between coalitions. Unlike traditional Shapley value-based methods that primarily focus on node attributes, our GraphEXT places greater emphasis on the interactions among nodes and the impact of structural changes on GNN predictions. Experimental studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that GraphEXT outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of fidelity across diverse GNN architectures , significantly enhancing the explainability of GNN models.</p></details> |  |

Although GNNs inherently encode specific inductive biases (e.g., acting as low-pass or high-pass filters), most existing methods implicitly assume conditional independence among node labels in their optimization objectives. While this assumption is suitable for traditional classification tasks such as image recognition, it contradicts the intuitive observation that node labels in graphs remain correlated, even after conditioning on the graph structure. To make structured predictions for node labels, we propose ReDiSC, namely, Reparameterized masked Diffusion model for Structured node Classification. ReDiSC estimates the joint distribution of node labels using a reparameterized masked diffusion model, which is learned through the variational expectation-maximization (EM) framework. Our theoretical analysis shows the efficiency advantage of ReDiSC in the E-step compared to DPM-SNC, a state-of-the-art model that relies on a manifold-constrained diffusion model in continuous domain. Meanwhile, we explicitly link ReDiSC's M-step objective to popular GNN and label propagation hybrid approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReDiSC achieves superior or highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GNN, label propagation, and diffusion-based baselines across both homophilic and heterophilic graphs of varying sizes. Notably, ReDiSC scales effectively to large-scale datasets on which previous structured diffusion methods fail due to computational constraints, highlighting its significant practical advantage in structured node classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, the traditional methods rely on standard graph structures often fail to capture the intricate higher-order spatio-temporal correlations inherent in real-world traffic dynamics. Standard graphs cannot fully represent the spatial relationships within road networks, which limits the effectiveness of graph-based approaches. In contrast, directed hypergraphs provide more accurate representation of spatial information to model complex directed relationships among multiple nodes. In this paper, we propose DHLight, a novel multi-agent policy-based framework that synergistically integrates directed hypergraph learning module. This framework introduces a novel dynamic directed hypergraph construction mechanism, which captures complex and evolving spatio-temporal relationships among intersections in road networks. By leveraging the directed hypergraph relational structure, DHLight empowers agents to achieve adaptive decision-making in traffic signal control. The effectiveness of DHLight is validated against state-of-the-art baselines through extensive experiments in various network datasets.

A GNN with shallow layer architectures can only learn short-term relation or localized structure information, limiting its power of learning long-term connection, evidenced by their inferior learning performance on heterophilous graphs. Tackling oversmoothing is crucial for harnessing deep-layer architectures for GNNs. To date, many methods have been proposed to alleviate oversmoothing. The vast difference behind their design principles, combined with graph complications, make it difficult to understand and even compare the difference between different approaches in tackling the oversmoothing. In this paper, we propose ATNPA, a unified view with five key steps: Augmentation, Transformation, Normalization, Propagation, and Aggregation, to summarize GNN oversmoothing alleviation approaches. We first propose a taxonomy for GNN oversmoothing alleviation which includes three themes to tackle oversmoothing. After that, we separate all methods into six categories, followed by detailed reviews of representative methods, including their relation to ATNPA, and discussion of their niche, strength, and weakness. The review not only draws an in-depth understanding of existing methods in the field but also shows a clear road map for future study.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages; Published at Knowledge and Information Systems Journal</p></details> |

Large-scale multi-site studies have exist, but they have acquisition-related biases due to scanner heterogeneity, compromising imaging consistency and downstream analyses. While existing SC harmonization methods - such as linear regression (LR), ComBat, and deep learning techniques - mitigate these biases, they often rely on detailed metadata, traveling subjects (TS), or overlook the graph-topology of SCs. To address these limitations, we propose a site-conditioned deep harmonization framework that harmonizes SCs across diverse acquisition sites without requiring metadata or TS that we test in a simulated scenario based on the Human Connectome Dataset. Within this framework, we benchmark three deep architectures - a fully connected autoencoder (AE), a convolutional AE, and a graph convolutional AE - against a top-performing LR baseline. While non-graph models excel in edge-weight prediction and edge existence detection, the graph AE demonstrates superior preservation of topological structure and subject-level individuality, as reflected by graph metrics and fingerprinting accuracy, respectively. Although the LR baseline achieves the highest numerical performance by explicitly modeling acquisition parameters, it lacks applicability to real-world multi-site use cases as detailed acquisition metadata is often unavailable. Our results highlight the critical role of model architecture in SC harmonization performance and demonstrate that graph-based approaches are particularly well-suited for structure-aware, domain-generalizable SC harmonization in large-scale multi-site SC studies.</p></details> |  |
