| **[Utilizing Multiple Testing for Grouping in Singular Spectrum Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01665v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key step in separating signal from noise in time series by means of singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is grouping. We present a multiple testing method for the grouping step in SSA. As separability criterion, we utilize the weighted correlation between the signal and the noise component of the (reconstructed) time series, and we test whether this weighted correlation is equal to zero. This test has to be performed for several possible groupings, resulting in a multiple test problem. The null distributions of the corresponding test statistics are approximated by a wild bootstrap procedure. The performance of our proposed method is assessed in a simulation study, and we illustrate its practical application with an analysis of real world data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fre-CW: Targeted Attack on Time Series Forecasting using Frequency Domain Loss](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08955v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models have made significant progress in time series forecasting. However, a key limitation of deep learning models is their susceptibility to adversarial attacks, which has not been studied enough in the context of time series prediction. In contrast to areas such as computer vision, where adversarial robustness has been extensively studied, frequency domain features of time series data play an important role in the prediction task but have not been sufficiently explored in terms of adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a time series prediction attack algorithm based on frequency domain loss. Specifically, we adapt an attack method originally designed for classification tasks to the prediction field and optimize the adversarial samples using both time-domain and frequency-domain losses. To the best of our knowledge, there is no relevant research on using frequency information for time-series adversarial attacks. Our experimental results show that these current time series prediction models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and our approach achieves excellent performance on major time series forecasting datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stationarity Exploration for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08919v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based time series forecasting has found widespread applications. Recently, converting time series data into the frequency domain for forecasting has become popular for accurately exploring periodic patterns. However, existing methods often cannot effectively explore stationary information from complex intertwined frequency components. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Amplitude-Phase Reconstruct Network (APRNet) that models the inter-relationships of amplitude and phase, which prevents the amplitude and phase from being constrained by different physical quantities, thereby decoupling the distinct characteristics of signals for capturing stationary information. Specifically, we represent the multivariate time series input across sequence and channel dimensions, highlighting the correlation between amplitude and phase at multiple interaction frequencies. We propose a novel Kolmogorov-Arnold-Network-based Local Correlation (KLC) module to adaptively fit local functions using univariate functions, enabling more flexible characterization of stationary features across different amplitudes and phases. This significantly enhances the model's capability to capture time-varying patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our APRNet against the state-of-the-arts (SOTAs).</p></details> |  |
| **[Explaining Time Series Classifiers with PHAR: Rule Extraction and Fusion from Post-hoc Attributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01687v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explaining machine learning (ML) models for time series (TS) classification remains challenging due to the difficulty of interpreting raw time series and the high dimensionality of the input space. We introduce PHAR-Post-hoc Attribution Rules-a unified framework that transforms numeric feature attributions from post-hoc, instance-wise explainers (e.g., LIME, SHAP) into structured, human-readable rules. These rules define interpretable intervals that indicate where and when key decision boundaries occur, enhancing model transparency. PHAR performs comparably to native rule-based methods, such as Anchor, while scaling more efficiently to long TS sequences and achieving broader instance coverage. A dedicated rule fusion step consolidates rule sets using strategies like weighted selection and lasso-based refinement, balancing key quality metrics: coverage, confidence, and simplicity. This fusion ensures each instance receives a concise and unambiguous rule, improving both explanation fidelity and consistency. We further introduce visualization techniques to illustrate specificity-generalization trade-offs in the derived rules. PHAR resolves conflicting and overlapping explanations-a common effect of the Rashomon phenomenon-into coherent, domain-adaptable insights. Comprehensive experiments on UCR/UEA Time Series Classification Archive demonstrate that PHAR improves interpretability, decision transparency, and practical applicability for TS classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wavelet Mixture of Experts for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08825v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of time series forecasting is rapidly advancing, with recent large-scale Transformers and lightweight Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models showing strong predictive performance. However, conventional Transformer models are often hindered by their large number of parameters and their limited ability to capture non-stationary features in data through smoothing. Similarly, MLP models struggle to manage multi-channel dependencies effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel, lightweight time series prediction model, WaveTS-B. This model combines wavelet transforms with MLP to capture both periodic and non-stationary characteristics of data in the wavelet domain. Building on this foundation, we propose a channel clustering strategy that incorporates a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, utilizing a gating mechanism and expert network to handle multi-channel dependencies efficiently. We propose WaveTS-M, an advanced model tailored for multi-channel time series prediction. Empirical evaluation across eight real-world time series datasets demonstrates that our WaveTS series models achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significantly fewer parameters. Notably, WaveTS-M shows substantial improvements on multi-channel datasets, highlighting its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProtoECGNet: Case-Based Interpretable Deep Learning for Multi-Label ECG Classification with Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08713v5)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based electrocardiogram (ECG) classification has shown impressive performance but clinical adoption has been slowed by the lack of transparent and faithful explanations. Post hoc methods such as saliency maps may fail to reflect a model's true decision process. Prototype-based reasoning offers a more transparent alternative by grounding decisions in similarity to learned representations of real ECG segments, enabling faithful, case-based explanations. We introduce ProtoECGNet, a prototype-based deep learning model for interpretable, multi-label ECG classification. ProtoECGNet employs a structured, multi-branch architecture that reflects clinical interpretation workflows: it integrates a 1D CNN with global prototypes for rhythm classification, a 2D CNN with time-localized prototypes for morphology-based reasoning, and a 2D CNN with global prototypes for diffuse abnormalities. Each branch is trained with a prototype loss designed for multi-label learning, combining clustering, separation, diversity, and a novel contrastive loss that encourages appropriate separation between prototypes of unrelated classes while allowing clustering for frequently co-occurring diagnoses. We evaluate ProtoECGNet on all 71 diagnostic labels from the PTB-XL dataset, demonstrating competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art black-box models while providing structured, case-based explanations. To assess prototype quality, we conduct a structured clinician review of the final model's projected prototypes, finding that they are rated as representative and clear. ProtoECGNet shows that prototype learning can be effectively scaled to complex, multi-label time-series classification, offering a practical path toward transparent and trustworthy deep learning models for clinical decision support.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to PMLR 298, 10th Machine Learning for Healthcare Conference (MLHC)</p></details> |
| **[M3-Net: A Cost-Effective Graph-Free MLP-Based Model for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08543v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving accurate traffic prediction is a fundamental but crucial task in the development of current intelligent transportation systems.Most of the mainstream methods that have made breakthroughs in traffic prediction rely on spatio-temporal graph neural networks, spatio-temporal attention mechanisms, etc. The main challenges of the existing deep learning approaches are that they either depend on a complete traffic network structure or require intricate model designs to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. These limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction performance and lightweight deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer Using Multimodal Learning on Electronic Health Record](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06627v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest cancers, and early detection remains a major clinical challenge due to the absence of specific symptoms and reliable biomarkers. In this work, we propose a new multimodal approach that integrates longitudinal diagnosis code histories and routinely collected laboratory measurements from electronic health records to detect PDAC up to one year prior to clinical diagnosis. Our method combines neural controlled differential equations to model irregular lab time series, pretrained language models and recurrent networks to learn diagnosis code trajectory representations, and cross-attention mechanisms to capture interactions between the two modalities. We develop and evaluate our approach on a real-world dataset of nearly 4,700 patients and achieve significant improvements in AUC ranging from 6.5% to 15.5% over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our model identifies diagnosis codes and laboratory panels associated with elevated PDAC risk, including both established and new biomarkers. Our code is available at https://github.com/MosbahAouad/EarlyPDAC-MML.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Federated Learning for Throughput Prediction in 5G Live Streaming Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08479v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and adaptive network throughput prediction is essential for latency-sensitive and bandwidth-intensive applications in 5G and emerging 6G networks. However, most existing methods rely on centralized training with uniformly collected data, limiting their applicability in heterogeneous mobile environments with non-IID data distributions. This paper presents the first comprehensive benchmarking of federated learning (FL) strategies for throughput prediction in realistic 5G edge scenarios. We evaluate three aggregation algorithms - FedAvg, FedProx, and FedBN - across four time-series architectures: LSTM, CNN, CNN+LSTM, and Transformer, using five diverse real-world datasets. We systematically analyze the effects of client heterogeneity, cohort size, and history window length on prediction performance. Our results reveal key trade-offs among model complexities, convergence rates, and generalization. It is found that FedBN consistently delivers robust performance under non-IID conditions. On the other hand, LSTM and Transformer models outperform CNN-based baselines by up to 80% in R2 scores. Moreover, although Transformers converge in half the rounds of LSTM, they require longer history windows to achieve a high R2, indicating higher context dependence. LSTM is, therefore, found to achieve a favorable balance between accuracy, rounds, and temporal footprint. To validate the end-to-end applicability of the framework, we have integrated our FL-based predictors into a live adaptive streaming pipeline. It is seen that FedBN-based LSTM and Transformer models improve mean QoE scores by 11.7% and 11.4%, respectively, over FedAvg, while also reducing the variance. These findings offer actionable insights for building scalable, privacy-preserving, and edge-aware throughput prediction systems in next-generation wireless networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 24 figures, submitted to IEEE TNET</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating lightweight unsupervised online IDS for masquerade attacks in CAN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13778v3)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicular controller area networks (CANs) are susceptible to masquerade attacks by malicious adversaries. In masquerade attacks, adversaries silence a targeted ID and then send malicious frames with forged content at the expected timing of benign frames. As masquerade attacks could seriously harm vehicle functionality and are the stealthiest attacks to detect in CAN, recent work has devoted attention to compare frameworks for detecting masquerade attacks in CAN. However, most existing works report offline evaluations using CAN logs already collected using simulations that do not comply with the domain's real-time constraints. Here we contribute to advance the state of the art by presenting a comparative evaluation of four different non-deep learning (DL)-based unsupervised online intrusion detection systems (IDS) for masquerade attacks in CAN. Our approach differs from existing comparative evaluations in that we analyze the effect of controlling streaming data conditions in a sliding window setting. In doing so, we use realistic masquerade attacks being replayed from the ROAD dataset. We show that although evaluated IDS are not effective at detecting every attack type, the method that relies on detecting changes in the hierarchical structure of clusters of time series produces the best results at the expense of higher computational overhead. We discuss limitations, open challenges, and how the evaluated methods can be used for practical unsupervised online CAN IDS for masquerade attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Rethinking Irregular Time Series Forecasting: A Simple yet Effective Baseline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11250v3)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The forecasting of irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) is a critical task in domains like healthcare and climate science. However, this task faces two significant hurdles: 1) the inherent non-uniformity and missing data in IMTS complicate the modeling of temporal dynamics, and 2) existing methods often rely on computationally expensive architectures. To address these dual challenges, we introduce APN, a general and efficient forecasting framework. At the core of APN is a novel Time-Aware Patch Aggregation (TAPA) module that introduces an aggregation-based paradigm for adaptive patching, moving beyond the limitations of fixed-span segmentation and interpolation-based methods. TAPA first learns dynamic temporal boundaries to define data-driven segments. Crucially, instead of resampling or interpolating, it directly computes patch representations via a time-aware weighted aggregation of all raw observations, where weights are determined by each observation's temporal relevance to the segment. This approach provides two key advantages: it preserves data fidelity by avoiding the introduction of artificial data points and ensures complete information coverage by design.The resulting regularized and information-rich patch representations enable the use of a lightweight query module for historical context aggregation and a simple MLP for final prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that APN establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[ME-TST+: Micro-expression Analysis via Temporal State Transition with ROI Relationship Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08082v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Micro-expressions (MEs) are regarded as important indicators of an individual's intrinsic emotions, preferences, and tendencies. ME analysis requires spotting of ME intervals within long video sequences and recognition of their corresponding emotional categories. Previous deep learning approaches commonly employ sliding-window classification networks. However, the use of fixed window lengths and hard classification presents notable limitations in practice. Furthermore, these methods typically treat ME spotting and recognition as two separate tasks, overlooking the essential relationship between them. To address these challenges, this paper proposes two state space model-based architectures, namely ME-TST and ME-TST+, which utilize temporal state transition mechanisms to replace conventional window-level classification with video-level regression. This enables a more precise characterization of the temporal dynamics of MEs and supports the modeling of MEs with varying durations. In ME-TST+, we further introduce multi-granularity ROI modeling and the slowfast Mamba framework to alleviate information loss associated with treating ME analysis as a time-series task. Additionally, we propose a synergy strategy for spotting and recognition at both the feature and result levels, leveraging their intrinsic connection to enhance overall analysis performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art performance. The codes are available at https://github.com/zizheng-guo/ME-TST.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Federated Learning for Scalable Power-demand Forecasting in Microgrids](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08022v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time monitoring of power consumption in cities and micro-grids through the Internet of Things (IoT) can help forecast future demand and optimize grid operations. But moving all consumer-level usage data to the cloud for predictions and analysis at fine time scales can expose activity patterns. Federated Learning~(FL) is a privacy-sensitive collaborative DNN training approach that retains data on edge devices, trains the models on private data locally, and aggregates the local models in the cloud. But key challenges exist: (i) clients can have non-independently identically distributed~(non-IID) data, and (ii) the learning should be computationally cheap while scaling to 1000s of (unseen) clients. In this paper, we develop and evaluate several optimizations to FL training across edge and cloud for time-series demand forecasting in micro-grids and city-scale utilities using DNNs to achieve a high prediction accuracy while minimizing the training cost. We showcase the benefit of using exponentially weighted loss while training and show that it further improves the prediction of the final model. Finally, we evaluate these strategies by validating over 1000s of clients for three states in the US from the OpenEIA corpus, and performing FL both in a pseudo-distributed setting and a Pi edge cluster. The results highlight the benefits of the proposed methods over baselines like ARIMA and DNNs trained for individual consumers, which are not scalable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Frequency-Domain Analysis of Time-Dependent Multiomic Data in Progressive Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Proposed Quantum-Classical Hybrid Approach with Quaternionic Extensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07948v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Progressive neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), exhibit complex, nonlinear trajectories that challenge deterministic modeling. Traditional time-domain analyses of multiomic and neuroimaging data often fail to capture hidden oscillatory patterns, limiting predictive accuracy. We propose a theoretical mathematical framework that transforms time-series data into frequency or s-domain using Fourier and Laplace transforms, models neuronal dynamics via Hamiltonian formulations, and employs quantum-classical hybrid computing with variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE) for enhanced pattern detection. This theoretical construct serves as a foundation for future empirical works in quantum-enhanced analysis of neurodegenerative diseases. We extend this to quaternionic representations with three imaginary axes ($i, j, k$) to model multistate Hamiltonians in multifaceted disorders, drawing from quantum neuromorphic computing to capture entangled neural dynamics \citep{Pehle2020, Emani2019}. This approach leverages quantum advantages in handling high-dimensional amplitude-phase data, enabling outlier detection and frequency signature analysis. Potential clinical applications include identifying high-risk patients with rapid progression or therapy resistance using s-domain biomarkers, supported by quantum machine learning (QML) precedents achieving up to 99.89% accuracy in Alzheimer's classification \citep{Belay2024, Bhowmik2025}. This framework aims to lay the groundwork for redefining precision medicine for neurodegenerative diseases through future validations.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Winner-takes-all for Multivariate Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05515v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce TimeMCL, a method leveraging the Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) paradigm to forecast multiple plausible time series futures. Our approach employs a neural network with multiple heads and utilizes the Winner-Takes-All (WTA) loss to promote diversity among predictions. MCL has recently gained attention due to its simplicity and ability to address ill-posed and ambiguous tasks. We propose an adaptation of this framework for time-series forecasting, presenting it as an efficient method to predict diverse futures, which we relate to its implicit quantization objective. We provide insights into our approach using synthetic data and evaluate it on real-world time series, demonstrating its promising performance at a light computational cost.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Adaptive Fine-Tuning via Pattern Specialization for Deep Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07927v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting poses significant challenges in non-stationary environments where underlying patterns evolve over time. In this work, we propose a novel framework that enhances deep neural network (DNN) performance by leveraging specialized model adaptation and selection. Initially, a base DNN is trained offline on historical time series data. A reserved validation subset is then segmented to extract and cluster the most dominant patterns within the series, thereby identifying distinct regimes. For each identified cluster, the base DNN is fine-tuned to produce a specialized version that captures unique pattern characteristics. At inference, the most recent input is matched against the cluster centroids, and the corresponding fine-tuned version is deployed based on the closest similarity measure. Additionally, our approach integrates a concept drift detection mechanism to identify and adapt to emerging patterns caused by non-stationary behavior. The proposed framework is generalizable across various DNN architectures and has demonstrated significant performance gains on both traditional DNNs and recent advanced architectures implemented in the GluonTS library.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adding structure to generalized additive models, with applications in ecology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07915v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalized additive models (GAMs) that connect a set of scalar covariates that map 1-1 to a response variable are commonly employed in ecological and other scientific disciplines. However, covariates are often inherently non-scalar, taking on multiple values for each observation of the response. They can sometimes have a temporal structure, e.g., a time series of temperature and precipitation measurements, or a spatial structure, e.g., multiple soil pH measurements made at nearby locations. While aggregating or selectively summarizing such covariates to yield a scalar covariate allows the use of standard GAM fitting procedures, exactly how to do so can be problematic, e.g., using a mean or median value for some subsequence of a time series, and information is necessarily lost as well. On the other hand naively including all $p$ components of a vector-valued covariate as $p$ separate covariates, say, without recognizing the structure, can lead to problems of multicollinearity, data sets that are excessively wide given the sample size, and difficulty extracting the primary signal provided by the covariate. In this paper we introduce three useful extensions to GAMs that provide means of efficiently and effectively handling vector-valued covariates without requiring one to choose problematic aggregations or selective summarizations. These extensions are varying-coefficient, scalar-on-function and distributed lag models. While these models have existed for some time they remain relatively underused in ecology. This article aims to show when these models can be useful and how to fit them with the popular R package \texttt{mgcv}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material will be posted online once data access agreements are in place</p></details> |
| **[Liquid Resistance Liquid Capacitance Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08791v4)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce liquid-resistance liquid-capacitance neural networks (LRCs), a neural-ODE model which considerably improve the generalization, accuracy, and biological plausibility of electrical equivalent circuits (EECs), liquid time-constant networks (LTCs), and saturated liquid time-constant networks (STCs), respectively. We also introduce LRC units (LRCUs), as a very efficient and accurate gated RNN-model, which results from solving LRCs with an explicit Euler scheme using just one unfolding. We empirically show and formally prove that the liquid capacitance of LRCs considerably dampens the oscillations of LTCs and STCs, while at the same time dramatically increasing accuracy even for cheap solvers. We experimentally demonstrate that LRCs are a highly competitive alternative to popular neural ODEs and gated RNNs in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability, on classic time-series benchmarks and a complex autonomous-driving lane-keeping task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stochastic dynamics learning with state-space systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07876v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work advances the theoretical foundations of reservoir computing (RC) by providing a unified treatment of fading memory and the echo state property (ESP) in both deterministic and stochastic settings. We investigate state-space systems, a central model class in time series learning, and establish that fading memory and solution stability hold generically -- even in the absence of the ESP -- offering a robust explanation for the empirical success of RC models without strict contractivity conditions. In the stochastic case, we critically assess stochastic echo states, proposing a novel distributional perspective rooted in attractor dynamics on the space of probability distributions, which leads to a rich and coherent theory. Our results extend and generalize previous work on non-autonomous dynamical systems, offering new insights into causality, stability, and memory in RC models. This lays the groundwork for reliable generative modeling of temporal data in both deterministic and stochastic regimes.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Experimental Reservoir-Augmented Foundation Model: 6G O-RAN Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07778v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next-generation open radio access networks (O-RAN) continuously stream tens of key performance indicators (KPIs) together with raw in-phase/quadrature (IQ) samples, yielding ultra-high-dimensional, non-stationary time series that overwhelm conventional transformer architectures. We introduce a reservoir-augmented masked autoencoding transformer (RA-MAT). This time series foundation model employs echo state network (ESN) computing with masked autoencoding to satisfy the stringent latency, energy efficiency, and scalability requirements of 6G O-RAN testing. A fixed, randomly initialized ESN rapidly projects each temporal patch into a rich dynamical embedding without backpropagation through time, converting the quadratic self-attention bottleneck into a lightweight linear operation. These embeddings drive a patch-wise masked autoencoder that reconstructs 30% randomly masked patches, compelling the encoder to capture both local dynamics and long-range structure from unlabeled data. After self-supervised pre-training, RA-MAT is fine-tuned with a shallow task head while keeping the reservoir and most transformer layers frozen, enabling low-footprint adaptation to diverse downstream tasks such as O-RAN KPI forecasting. In a comprehensive O-RAN KPI case study, RA-MAT achieved sub-0.06 mean squared error (MSE) on several continuous and discrete KPIs. This work positions RA-MAT as a practical pathway toward real-time, foundation-level analytics in future 6G networks.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Sortability of Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13313v3)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the performance of causal discovery algorithms that aim to find causal relationships between time-dependent processes remains a challenging topic. In this paper, we show that certain characteristics of datasets, such as varsortability (Reisach et al. 2021) and $R^2$-sortability (Reisach et al. 2023), also occur in datasets for autocorrelated stationary time series. We illustrate this empirically using four types of data: simulated data based on SVAR models and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, the data used in the 2019 causality-for-climate challenge (Runge et al. 2019), real-world river stream datasets, and real-world data generated by the Causal Chamber of (Gamella et al. 2024). To do this, we adapt var- and $R^2$-sortability to time series data. We also investigate the extent to which the performance of score-based causal discovery methods goes hand in hand with high sortability. Arguably, our most surprising finding is that the investigated real-world datasets exhibit high varsortability and low $R^2$-sortability indicating that scales may carry a significant amount of causal information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research, also presented at the Causal Inference for Time Series Data Workshop at the 40th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (CI4TS 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Semantic-Enhanced Time-Series Forecasting via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07697v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a significant role in finance, energy, meteorology, and IoT applications. Recent studies have leveraged the generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adapt to time series forecasting, achieving promising performance. However, existing studies focus on token-level modal alignment, instead of bridging the intrinsic modality gap between linguistic knowledge structures and time series data patterns, greatly limiting the semantic representation. To address this issue, we propose a novel Semantic-Enhanced LLM (SE-LLM) that explores the inherent periodicity and anomalous characteristics of time series to embed into the semantic space to enhance the token embedding. This process enhances the interpretability of tokens for LLMs, thereby activating the potential of LLMs for temporal sequence analysis. Moreover, existing Transformer-based LLMs excel at capturing long-range dependencies but are weak at modeling short-term anomalies in time-series data. Hence, we propose a plugin module embedded within self-attention that models long-term and short-term dependencies to effectively adapt LLMs to time-series analysis. Our approach freezes the LLM and reduces the sequence dimensionality of tokens, greatly reducing computational consumption. Experiments demonstrate the superiority performance of our SE-LLM against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p></details> | 14 pages,9 figures |
| **[AIS-LLM: A Unified Framework for Maritime Trajectory Prediction, Anomaly Detection, and Collision Risk Assessment with Explainable Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07668v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increase in maritime traffic and the mandatory implementation of the Automatic Identification System (AIS), the importance and diversity of maritime traffic analysis tasks based on AIS data, such as vessel trajectory prediction, anomaly detection, and collision risk assessment, is rapidly growing. However, existing approaches tend to address these tasks individually, making it difficult to holistically consider complex maritime situations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, AIS-LLM, which integrates time-series AIS data with a large language model (LLM). AIS-LLM consists of a Time-Series Encoder for processing AIS sequences, an LLM-based Prompt Encoder, a Cross-Modality Alignment Module for semantic alignment between time-series data and textual prompts, and an LLM-based Multi-Task Decoder. This architecture enables the simultaneous execution of three key tasks: trajectory prediction, anomaly detection, and risk assessment of vessel collisions within a single end-to-end system. Experimental results demonstrate that AIS-LLM outperforms existing methods across individual tasks, validating its effectiveness. Furthermore, by integratively analyzing task outputs to generate situation summaries and briefings, AIS-LLM presents the potential for more intelligent and efficient maritime traffic management.</p></details> |  |
| **[N-BEATS-MOE: N-BEATS with a Mixture-of-Experts Layer for Heterogeneous Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07490v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning approaches are increasingly relevant for time series forecasting tasks. Methods such as N-BEATS, which is built on stacks of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) blocks, have achieved state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets and competitions. N-BEATS is also more interpretable relative to other deep learning approaches, as it decomposes forecasts into different time series components, such as trend and seasonality. In this work, we present N-BEATS-MOE, an extension of N-BEATS based on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layer. N-BEATS-MOE employs a dynamic block weighting strategy based on a gating network which allows the model to better adapt to the characteristics of each time series. We also hypothesize that the gating mechanism provides additional interpretability by identifying which expert is most relevant for each series. We evaluate our method across 12 benchmark datasets against several approaches, achieving consistent improvements on several datasets, especially those composed of heterogeneous time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging GNN to Enhance MEF Method in Predicting ENSO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07410v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable long-lead forecasting of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) remains a long-standing challenge in climate science. The previously developed Multimodal ENSO Forecast (MEF) model uses 80 ensemble predictions by two independent deep learning modules: a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) and a time-series module. In their approach, outputs of the two modules are combined using a weighting strategy wherein one is prioritized over the other as a function of global performance. Separate weighting or testing of individual ensemble members did not occur, however, which may have limited the model to optimize the use of high-performing but spread-out forecasts. In this study, we propose a better framework that employs graph-based analysis to directly model similarity between all 80 members of the ensemble. By constructing an undirected graph whose vertices are ensemble outputs and whose weights on edges measure similarity (via RMSE and correlation), we identify and cluster structurally similar and accurate predictions. From which we obtain an optimized subset of 20 members using community detection methods. The final prediction is then obtained by averaging this optimized subset. This method improves the forecast skill through noise removal and emphasis on ensemble coherence. Interestingly, our graph-based selection shows robust statistical characteristics among top performers, offering new ensemble behavior insights. In addition, we observe that while the GNN-based approach does not always outperform the baseline MEF under every scenario, it produces more stable and consistent outputs, particularly in compound long-lead situations. The approach is model-agnostic too, suggesting that it can be applied directly to other forecasting models with gargantuan ensemble outputs, such as statistical, physical, or hybrid models.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

We have created BIGBOY1.2, an open synthetic dataset generator that creates configurable epidemic time series and population-level trajectories suitable for benchmarking modelling, forecasting, and visualisation. The framework supports SEIR and SIR-like compartmental logic, custom seasonality, and noise injection to mimic real reporting artifacts. BIGBOY1.2 can produce datasets with diverse characteristics, making it suitable for comparing traditional epidemiological models (e.g., SIR, SEIR) with modern machine learning approaches (e.g., SVM, neural networks).</p></details> |  |
| **[Adapting LLMs to Time Series Forecasting via Temporal Heterogeneity Modeling and Semantic Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07195v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language processing due to their strong generalization and sequence modeling capabilities. However, their direct application to time series forecasting remains challenging due to two fundamental issues: the inherent heterogeneity of temporal patterns and the modality gap between continuous numerical signals and discrete language representations. In this work, we propose TALON, a unified framework that enhances LLM-based forecasting by modeling temporal heterogeneity and enforcing semantic alignment. Specifically, we design a Heterogeneous Temporal Encoder that partitions multivariate time series into structurally coherent segments, enabling localized expert modeling across diverse temporal patterns. To bridge the modality gap, we introduce a Semantic Alignment Module that aligns temporal features with LLM-compatible representations, enabling effective integration of time series into language-based models while eliminating the need for handcrafted prompts during inference. Extensive experiments on seven real-world benchmarks demonstrate that TALON achieves superior performance across all datasets, with average MSE improvements of up to 11\% over recent state-of-the-art methods. These results underscore the effectiveness of incorporating both pattern-aware and semantic-aware designs when adapting LLMs for time series forecasting.

This study presents the first comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows, encompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer learning approaches. To identify the optimal time-series generation approaches and supervised crop mapping models, we conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite image-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise classification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of varied training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified optimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift. The evaluation of optimal methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural sites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from CDL trusted pixels and field surveys. Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval preprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal performance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid training and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and direct transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques enhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop classes while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally, workflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a sufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate and generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that matches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop mapping. All code is publicly available to encourage reproducibility practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>A rev...</summary><p>A review paper on pixel-wise approaches for large-scale crop mapping. 29 pages, 18 figures.

Given that the typical data (i.e., videos and images) collected by the fleet of UAVs deployed in such scenarios can be considerably larger than what the onboard computers can process, the UAVs need to offload their data in real-time to the edge and the cloud for further processing. To that end, we present the design of AerialDB - a lightweight decentralized data storage and query system that can store and process time series data on a multi-UAV system comprising: A) a fleet of hundreds of UAVs fitted with onboard computers, and B) ground-based edge servers connected through a cellular link. Leveraging lightweight techniques for content-based replica placement and indexing of shards, AerialDB has been optimized for efficient processing of different possible combinations of typical spatial and temporal queries performed by real-world disaster management applications. Using containerized deployment spanning up to 400 drones and 80 edges, we demonstrate that AerialDB is able to scale efficiently while providing near real-time performance with different realistic workloads. Further, AerialDB comprises a decentralized and locality-aware distributed execution engine which provides graceful degradation of performance upon edge failures with relatively low latency while processing large spatio-temporal data. AerialDB exhibits comparable insertion performance and 100 times improvement in query performance against state-of-the-art baseline. Moreover, it exhibits a 10 times and 100 times improvement with insertion and query workloads respectively over the cloud baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[TLCCSP: A Scalable Framework for Enhancing Time Series Forecasting with Time-Lagged Cross-Correlations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07016v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is critical across various domains, such as weather, finance and real estate forecasting, as accurate forecasts support informed decision-making and risk mitigation. While recent deep learning models have improved predictive capabilities, they often overlook time-lagged cross-correlations between related sequences, which are crucial for capturing complex temporal relationships. To address this, we propose the Time-Lagged Cross-Correlations-based Sequence Prediction framework (TLCCSP), which enhances forecasting accuracy by effectively integrating time-lagged cross-correlated sequences. TLCCSP employs the Sequence Shifted Dynamic Time Warping (SSDTW) algorithm to capture lagged correlations and a contrastive learning-based encoder to efficiently approximate SSDTW distances. Experimental results on weather, finance and real estate time series datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. On the weather dataset, SSDTW reduces mean squared error (MSE) by 16.01% compared with single-sequence methods, while the contrastive learning encoder (CLE) further decreases MSE by 17.88%. On the stock dataset, SSDTW achieves a 9.95% MSE reduction, and CLE reduces it by 6.13%. For the real estate dataset, SSDTW and CLE reduce MSE by 21.29% and 8.62%, respectively. Additionally, the contrastive learning approach decreases SSDTW computational time by approximately 99%, ensuring scalability and real-time applicability across multiple time series forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A near-linear time approximation scheme for $(k,\ell)$-median clustering under discrete Fréchet distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07008v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A time series of complexity $m$ is a sequence of $m$ real valued measurements. The discrete Fr\'echet distance $d_{dF}(x,y)$ is a distance measure between two time series $x$ and $y$ of possibly different complexity. Given a set of $n$ time series represented as $m$-dimensional vectors over the reals, the $(k,\ell)$-median problem under discrete Fr\'echet distance aims to find a set $C$ of $k$ time series of complexity $\ell$ such that $$\sum_{x\in P} \min_{c\in C} d_{dF}(x,c)$$ is minimized. In this paper, we give the first near-linear time $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for this problem when $\ell$ and $\varepsilon$ are constants but $k$ can be as large as $\Omega(n)$. We obtain our result by introducing a new dimension reduction technique for discrete Fr\'echet distance and then adapt an algorithm of Cohen-Addad et al. (J. ACM 2021) to work on the dimension-reduced input. As a byproduct we also improve the best coreset construction for $(k,\ell)$-median under discrete Fr\'echet distance (Cohen-Addad et al., SODA 2025) and show that its size can be independent of the number of input time series \emph{ and } their complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intrinsic Explainability of Multimodal Learning for Crop Yield Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06939v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning enables various machine learning tasks to benefit from diverse data sources, effectively mimicking the interplay of different factors in real-world applications, particularly in agriculture. While the heterogeneous nature of involved data modalities may necessitate the design of complex architectures, the model interpretability is often overlooked. In this study, we leverage the intrinsic explainability of Transformer-based models to explain multimodal learning networks, focusing on the task of crop yield prediction at the subfield level. The large datasets used cover various crops, regions, and years, and include four different input modalities: multispectral satellite and weather time series, terrain elevation maps and soil properties. Based on the self-attention mechanism, we estimate feature attributions using two methods, namely the Attention Rollout (AR) and Generic Attention (GA), and evaluate their performance against Shapley-based model-agnostic estimations, Shapley Value Sampling (SVS). Additionally, we propose the Weighted Modality Activation (WMA) method to assess modality attributions and compare it with SVS attributions. Our findings indicate that Transformer-based models outperform other architectures, specifically convolutional and recurrent networks, achieving R2 scores that are higher by 0.10 and 0.04 at the subfield and field levels, respectively. AR is shown to provide more robust and reliable temporal attributions, as confirmed through qualitative and quantitative evaluation, compared to GA and SVS values. Information about crop phenology stages was leveraged to interpret the explanation results in the light of established agronomic knowledge. Furthermore, modality attributions revealed varying patterns across the two methods compared.[...]</p></details> |  |
| **[QuiZSF: An efficient data-model interaction framework for zero-shot time-series forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06915v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting has become increasingly important to empower diverse applications with streaming data. Zero-shot time-series forecasting (ZSF), particularly valuable in data-scarce scenarios, such as domain transfer or forecasting under extreme conditions, is difficult for traditional models to deal with. While time series pre-trained models (TSPMs) have demonstrated strong performance in ZSF, they often lack mechanisms to dynamically incorporate external knowledge. Fortunately, emerging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a promising path for injecting such knowledge on demand, yet they are rarely integrated with TSPMs. To leverage the strengths of both worlds, we introduce RAG into TSPMs to enhance zero-shot time series forecasting. In this paper, we propose QuiZSF (Quick Zero-Shot Time Series Forecaster), a lightweight and modular framework that couples efficient retrieval with representation learning and model adaptation for ZSF. Specifically, we construct a hierarchical tree-structured ChronoRAG Base (CRB) for scalable time-series storage and domain-aware retrieval, introduce a Multi-grained Series Interaction Learner (MSIL) to extract fine- and coarse-grained relational features, and develop a dual-branch Model Cooperation Coherer (MCC) that aligns retrieved knowledge with two kinds of TSPMs: Non-LLM based and LLM based. Compared with contemporary baselines, QuiZSF, with Non-LLM based and LLM based TSPMs as base model, respectively, ranks Top1 in 75% and 87.5% of prediction settings, while maintaining high efficiency in memory and inference time.</p></details> |  |

While Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have shown benefits in modeling complex traffic dependencies, the existing GCN-based approaches cannot fully extract and fuse multi-granular spatiotemporal features across various spatial and temporal scales sufficiently in a complete manner, proven to yield less accurate results. Besides, as extracting multi-granular features across scales has been a promising strategy across domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, and time-series forecasting, pioneering studies have attempted to leverage a similar mechanism for spatiotemporal traffic data mining. However, additional feature extraction branches introduced in prior studies critically increased model complexity and extended inference time, making it challenging to provide fast forecasts. In this paper, we propose MultiGran-STGCNFog, an efficient fog distributed inference system with a novel traffic forecasting model that employs multi-granular spatiotemporal feature fusion on generated dynamic traffic graphs to fully capture interdependent traffic dynamics. The proposed scheduling algorithm GA-DPHDS, optimizing layer execution order and layer-device scheduling scheme simultaneously, contributes to considerable inference throughput improvement by coordinating heterogeneous fog devices in a pipelined manner. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over selected GCN baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 34th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2025)</p></details> |

Neural networks process information through artificial neurons, conceptually inspired by patterns of activation in the brain. However, their hierarchical structure and high-dimensional parameter space pose challenges for understanding and controlling training dynamics. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to characterize training dynamics in neural networks by representing evolving neural activations as functional connectomes and extracting dynamic signatures of activity throughout training. Our results show that these signatures effectively capture key transitions in the functional organization of the network. Building on this analysis, we propose the use of a time series of functional connectomes as an intrinsic indicator of learning progress, enabling a principled early stopping criterion. Our framework performs robustly across benchmarks and provides new insights into neural network training dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Bridging the Last Mile of Prediction: Enhancing Time Series Forecasting with Conditional Guided Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07192v3)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing generative models for time series forecasting often transform simple priors (typically Gaussian) into complex data distributions. However, their sampling initialization, independent of historical data, hinders the capture of temporal dependencies, limiting predictive accuracy. They also treat residuals merely as optimization targets, ignoring that residuals often exhibit meaningful patterns like systematic biases or nontrivial distributional structures. To address these, we propose Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM), a novel model-agnostic framework that extends flow matching by integrating outputs from an auxiliary predictive model. This enables learning from the probabilistic structure of prediction residuals, leveraging the auxiliary model's prediction distribution as a source to reduce learning difficulty and refine forecasts. CGFM incorporates historical data as both conditions and guidance, uses two-sided conditional paths (with source and target conditioned on the same history), and employs affine paths to expand the path space, avoiding path crossing without complex mechanisms, preserving temporal consistency, and strengthening distribution alignment. Experiments across datasets and baselines show CGFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, advancing forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[ClimateSOM: A Visual Analysis Workflow for Climate Ensemble Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06732v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensemble datasets are ever more prevalent in various scientific domains. In climate science, ensemble datasets are used to capture variability in projections under plausible future conditions including greenhouse and aerosol emissions. Each ensemble model run produces projections that are fundamentally similar yet meaningfully distinct. Understanding this variability among ensemble model runs and analyzing its magnitude and patterns is a vital task for climate scientists. In this paper, we present ClimateSOM, a visual analysis workflow that leverages a self-organizing map (SOM) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to support interactive exploration and interpretation of climate ensemble datasets. The workflow abstracts climate ensemble model runs - spatiotemporal time series - into a distribution over a 2D space that captures the variability among the ensemble model runs using a SOM. LLMs are integrated to assist in sensemaking of this SOM-defined 2D space, the basis for the visual analysis tasks. In all, ClimateSOM enables users to explore the variability among ensemble model runs, identify patterns, compare and cluster the ensemble model runs. To demonstrate the utility of ClimateSOM, we apply the workflow to an ensemble dataset of precipitation projections over California and the Northwestern United States. Furthermore, we conduct a short evaluation of our LLM integration, and conduct an expert review of the visual workflow and the insights from the case studies with six domain experts to evaluate our approach and its utility.</p></details> |  |

As an alternative, we develop a randomization inference framework for before-and-after studies with multiple units, designed specifically for short-term causal inference and allowing for general assignment mechanisms. The method provides finite-sample-valid statistical inferences without relying on parametric time series models or extrapolation. We demonstrate its utility by analyzing a major criminal justice reform in Uruguay that switched from an inquisitorial to an adversarial system in November 2017. Our method relies on the key assumption of no local time trends near the policy adoption time, which is supported by several falsification tests in our empirical study. We find a statistically significant short-term causal effect: an increase of approximately 25 daily police reports (an 8% rise) in the first week of the new justice system. Our randomization inference framework provides a robust and flexible methodology for evaluating policy adoptions in before-and-after studies with multiple units.</p></details> |  |

Traditional static thresholds are easily rendered obsolete by regime shifts, concept drift, or multi-scale changes. To address these challenges, we introduce and empirically evaluate two novel adaptive thresholding frameworks: Segmented Confidence Sequences (SCS) and Multi-Scale Adaptive Confidence Segments (MACS). Both leverage statistical online learning and segmentation principles for local, contextually sensitive adaptation, maintaining guarantees on false alarm rates even under evolving distributions. Our experiments across Wafer Manufacturing benchmark datasets show significant F1-score improvement compared to traditional percentile and rolling quantile approaches. This work demonstrates that robust, statistically principled adaptive thresholds enable reliable, interpretable, and timely detection of diverse real-world anomalies.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |

In this research, we develop a Bayesian framework capturing time series with collective anomalies and change points, and introduce a recursive online inference algorithm to detect the most recent collective anomaly and change point jointly. For scaling, we further propose an algorithm enhanced with collective anomaly removal that effectively reduces the time and space complexity to linear. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach via extensive experiments on simulated data and two real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

| **[Movement-Prediction-Adjusted Naive Forecast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14469v9)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In financial time series forecasting, surpassing the naive forecast is challenging due to the randomness in the data. To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel forecast combination method, the movement-prediction-adjusted naive forecast (MPANF), which is designed to improve point forecasts beyond the naive baseline. Specifically, MPANF integrates two forecasting components: a naive forecast and a movement prediction. The final forecast is generated by adjusting the naive forecast with a movement prediction term, the weight of which is the product of two in-sample quantities: one is a coefficient determined from the movement prediction accuracy and the other is the mean absolute increment. The performance of MPANF was evaluated on eight financial time series via standard metrics, including the RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and sMAPE. Under modest movement prediction accuracy slightly above 0.55, MPANF generally outperforms common benchmarks such as the naive forecast, naive forecast with drift, integrated moving average of order (1,1) (IMA(1,1)), and linear regression. These findings suggest that MPANF can serve as an effective second-stage method when reliable movement predictions are available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-Prompt: Integrated Heterogeneous Prompts for Unlocking LLMs in Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17631v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting aims to model temporal dependencies among variables for future state inference, holding significant importance and widespread applications in real-world scenarios. Although deep learning-based methods have achieved remarkable progress, they still exhibit suboptimal performance in long-term forecasting and data-scarce scenarios. Recent research demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) achieve promising performance in time series forecasting. However, we find existing LLM-based methods still have shortcomings: (1) the absence of a unified paradigm for textual prompt formulation and (2) the neglect of modality discrepancies between textual prompts and time series. To address this, we propose LLM-Prompt, an LLM-based time series forecasting framework integrating multi-prompt information and cross-modal semantic alignment. Specifically, we first construct a unified textual prompt paradigm containing learnable soft prompts and textualized hard prompts. Second, to enhance LLMs' comprehensive understanding of the forecasting task, we design a semantic space embedding and cross-modal alignment module to achieve cross-modal fusion of temporal and textual information. Finally, the transformed time series from the LLMs are projected to obtain the forecasts. Comprehensive evaluations on 6 public datasets and 3 carbon emission datasets demonstrate that LLM-Prompt is a powerful framework for time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |

Salient events like monetary policy decisions and employment reports often trigger market movements by shaping expectations of economic growth and risk, thereby establishing causal relationships between events and market behavior. Existing forecasting methods typically focus either on textual analysis or time-series modeling, but fail to capture the multi-modal nature of financial markets and the causal relationship between events and price movements. To address these gaps, we propose CAMEF (Causal-Augmented Multi-Modality Event-Driven Financial Forecasting), a multi-modality framework that effectively integrates textual and time-series data with a causal learning mechanism and an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation technique for causal-enhanced financial forecasting. Our contributions include: (1) a multi-modal framework that captures causal relationships between policy texts and historical price data; (2) a new financial dataset with six types of macroeconomic releases from 2008 to April 2024, and high-frequency real trading data for five key U.S. financial assets; and (3) an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation strategy. We compare CAMEF to state-of-the-art transformer-based time-series and multi-modal baselines, and perform ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the causal learning mechanism and event types.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in SIGKDD 2025</p></details> |

However, most of these frameworks do not consider intrinsic relationships between variables in multivariate time series data, thus ignoring the causal relationship among variables and degrading anomaly detection performance. This work proposes a novel framework called CGAD, an entropy Causal Graph for multivariate time series Anomaly Detection. CGAD utilizes transfer entropy to construct graph structures that unveil the underlying causal relationships among time series data. Weighted graph convolutional networks combined with causal convolutions are employed to model both the causal graph structures and the temporal patterns within multivariate time series data. Furthermore, CGAD applies anomaly scoring, leveraging median absolute deviation-based normalization to improve the robustness of the anomaly identification process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CGAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets with a 9% average improvement in terms of three different multivariate time series anomaly detection metrics.</p></details> | 25 pages, 8 figures |

Previous methods often adopt black-box modeling of pedestrian interactions, treating all neighbors uniformly. Despite their strong performance, such opaque modeling limits the reliability of predictions in safety-critical real-world deployments. To address this issue, we propose InSyn (Interaction-Synchronization Network), a novel Transformer-based model that explicitly captures diverse interaction patterns (e.g., walking in sync or conflicting) while effectively modeling direction-sensitive social behaviors. Additionally, we introduce a training strategy, termed Seq-Start of Seq (SSOS), designed to alleviate the common issue of initial-step divergence in numerical time-series prediction. Experiments on the ETH and UCY datasets demonstrate that our model not only outperforms recent black-box baselines in prediction accuracy, especially under high-density scenarios, but also provides stronger interpretability, achieving a favorable trade-off between reliability and accuracy. Furthermore, the SSOS strategy proves to be effective in improving sequential prediction performance, reducing the initial-step prediction error by approximately 6.58%.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models show promise in structured reasoning tasks, their ability to infer interpretable, context-aligned symbolic structures from time series data is still underexplored. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce SymbolBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess symbolic reasoning over real-world time series across three tasks: multivariate symbolic regression, Boolean network inference, and causal discovery. Unlike prior efforts limited to simple algebraic equations, SymbolBench spans a diverse set of symbolic forms with varying complexity. We further propose a unified framework that integrates LLMs with genetic programming to form a closed-loop symbolic reasoning system, where LLMs act both as predictors and evaluators.

Decomposition is done by applying machine learning to fit a dual signal. Machine learning minimizes the loss function which compromises between fitting the original time series and penalizing irregularities of the dual signal. The latter includes terms based on the first and second order derivatives along time. To preserve special patterns, weighting of the regularization components of the loss function has been introduced based on Statistical Process Control methodology. The proposed decomposition can be applied as a smoothing algorithm against the mean and dispersion of the time series. By isolating noise, the proposed decomposition can be seen as a denoising algorithm. Two approaches of the learning process have been considered: sequential and jointly. The former approach learns the mean signal first and then dispersion. The latter approach fits the dual signal jointly. Jointly learning can uncover complex relationships for the time series with heteroskedasticity. Learning has been set by solving the direct non-linear unconstrained optimization problem or by applying neural networks that have sequential or twin output architectures. Tuning of the loss function hyperparameters focuses on the isolated noise to be a stationary stochastic process without autocorrelation properties. Depending on the applications, the hyperparameters of the learning can be tuned towards either the discrete states by stepped signal or smoothed series. The decomposed dual signal can be represented on the 2D space and used to learn inherent structures, to forecast both mean and dispersion, or to analyze cross effects in case of multiple time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 9 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Holistic Explainable AI (H-XAI): Extending Transparency Beyond Developers in AI-Driven Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05792v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current eXplainable AI (XAI) methods largely serve developers, often focusing on justifying model outputs rather than supporting diverse stakeholder needs. A recent shift toward Evaluative AI reframes explanation as a tool for hypothesis testing, but still focuses primarily on operational organizations. We introduce Holistic-XAI (H-XAI), a unified framework that integrates causal rating methods with traditional XAI methods to support explanation as an interactive, multi-method process. H-XAI allows stakeholders to ask a series of questions, test hypotheses, and compare model behavior against automatically constructed random and biased baselines. It combines instance-level and global explanations, adapting to each stakeholder's goals, whether understanding individual decisions, assessing group-level bias, or evaluating robustness under perturbations. We demonstrate the generality of our approach through two case studies spanning six scenarios: binary credit risk classification and financial time-series forecasting. H-XAI fills critical gaps left by existing XAI methods by combining causal ratings and post-hoc explanations to answer stakeholder-specific questions at both the individual decision level and the overall model level.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Imperfect Signals to Trustworthy Structure: Confidence-Aware Inference from Heterogeneous and Reliability-Varying Utility Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05791v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate distribution grid topology is essential for reliable modern grid operations. However, real-world utility data originates from multiple sources with varying characteristics and levels of quality. In this work, developed in collaboration with Oncor Electric Delivery, we propose a scalable framework that reconstructs a trustworthy grid topology by systematically integrating heterogeneous data. We observe that distribution topology is fundamentally governed by two complementary dimensions: the spatial layout of physical infrastructure (e.g., GIS and asset metadata) and the dynamic behavior of the system in the signal domain (e.g., voltage time series). When jointly leveraged, these dimensions support a complete and physically coherent reconstruction of network connectivity. To address the challenge of uneven data quality without compromising observability, we introduce a confidence-aware inference mechanism that preserves structurally informative yet imperfect inputs, while quantifying the reliability of each inferred connection for operator interpretation. This soft handling of uncertainty is tightly coupled with hard enforcement of physical feasibility: we embed operational constraints, such as transformer capacity limits and radial topology requirements, directly into the learning process. Together, these components ensure that inference is both uncertainty-aware and structurally valid, enabling rapid convergence to actionable, trustworthy topologies under real-world deployment conditions. The proposed framework is validated using data from over 8000 meters across 3 feeders in Oncor's service territory, demonstrating over 95% accuracy in topology reconstruction and substantial improvements in confidence calibration and computational efficiency relative to baseline methods.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Discrepancy-Aware Contrastive Adaptation in Medical Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05572v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In medical time series disease diagnosis, two key challenges are identified. First, the high annotation cost of medical data leads to overfitting in models trained on label-limited, single-center datasets. To address this, we propose incorporating external data from related tasks and leveraging AE-GAN to extract prior knowledge, providing valuable references for downstream tasks. Second, many existing studies employ contrastive learning to derive more generalized medical sequence representations for diagnostic tasks, usually relying on manually designed diverse positive and negative sample pairs. However, these approaches are complex, lack generalizability, and fail to adaptively capture disease-specific features across different conditions. To overcome this, we introduce LMCF (Learnable Multi-views Contrastive Framework), a framework that integrates a multi-head attention mechanism and adaptively learns representations from different views through inter-view and intra-view contrastive learning strategies. Additionally, the pre-trained AE-GAN is used to reconstruct discrepancies in the target data as disease probabilities, which are then integrated into the contrastive learning process. Experiments on three target datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms other seven baselines, highlighting its significant impact on healthcare applications such as the diagnosis of myocardial infarction, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. We release the source code at xxxxx.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Bayesian Gaussian Process ODEs via Double Normalizing Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09222v3)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Gaussian processes have been used to model the vector field of continuous dynamical systems, referred to as GPODEs, which are characterized by a probabilistic ODE equation. Bayesian inference for these models has been extensively studied and applied in tasks such as time series prediction. However, the use of standard GPs with basic kernels like squared exponential kernels has been common in GPODE research, limiting the model's ability to represent complex scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce normalizing flows to reparameterize the ODE vector field, resulting in a data-driven prior distribution, thereby increasing flexibility and expressive power. We develop a data-driven variational learning algorithm that utilizes analytically tractable probability density functions of normalizing flows, enabling simultaneous learning and inference of unknown continuous dynamics. Additionally, we also apply normalizing flows to the posterior inference of GP ODEs to resolve the issue of strong mean-field assumptions in posterior inference. By applying normalizing flows in both these ways, our model improves accuracy and uncertainty estimates for Bayesian Gaussian Process ODEs. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on simulated dynamical systems and real-world human motion data, including time series prediction and missing data recovery tasks. Experimental results show that our proposed method effectively captures model uncertainty while improving accuracy.</p></details> |  |

At present, deep learning time series prediction has become the mainstream method. However, the multi-scale time dynamics and the irregularity of real data lead to the limitations of the existing methods. Therefore, we propose EnergyPatchTST, which is an extension of the Patch Time Series Transformer specially designed for energy forecasting. The main innovations of our method are as follows: (1) multi-scale feature extraction mechanism to capture patterns with different time resolutions; (2) probability prediction framework to estimate uncertainty through Monte Carlo elimination; (3) integration path of future known variables (such as temperature and wind conditions); And (4) Pre-training and Fine-tuning examples to enhance the performance of limited energy data sets. A series of experiments on common energy data sets show that EnergyPatchTST is superior to other commonly used methods, the prediction error is reduced by 7-12%, and reliable uncertainty estimation is provided, which provides an important reference for time series prediction in the energy field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the International Conference on Intelligent Computing (ICIC 2025). 12 pages.

Previous research shows that Echo State Networks (ESNs) can effectively model short-term stock market movements, capturing nonlinear patterns in dynamic data. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the first to explore ESNs for cryptocurrency forecasting, especially during extreme volatility. We also conduct chaos analysis through the Lyapunov exponent in chaotic periods and show that our approach outperforms existing machine learning methods by a significant margin. Our findings are consistent with the Lyapunov exponent analysis, showing that ESNs are robust during chaotic periods and excel under high chaos compared to Boosting and Na\"ive methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Graph Topology Learning via Time-Vertex Adaptive Filters: From Theory to Cardiac Fibrillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01567v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Signal Processing (GSP) provides a powerful framework for analysing complex, interconnected systems by modelling data as signals on graphs. While recent advances have enabled graph topology learning from observed signals, existing methods often struggle with time-varying systems and real-time applications. To address this gap, we introduce AdaCGP, a sparsity-aware adaptive algorithm for dynamic graph topology estimation from multivariate time series. AdaCGP estimates the Graph Shift Operator (GSO) through recursive update formulae designed to address sparsity, shift-invariance, and bias. Through comprehensive simulations, we demonstrate that AdaCGP consistently outperforms multiple baselines across diverse graph topologies, achieving improvements exceeding 83% in GSO estimation compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining favourable computational scaling properties. Our variable splitting approach enables reliable identification of causal connections with near-zero false alarm rates and minimal missed edges. Applied to cardiac fibrillation recordings, AdaCGP tracks dynamic changes in propagation patterns more effectively than established methods like Granger causality, capturing temporal variations in graph topology that static approaches miss. The algorithm successfully identifies stability characteristics in conduction patterns that may maintain arrhythmias, demonstrating potential for clinical applications in diagnosis and treatment of complex biomedical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlowState: Sampling Rate Invariant Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05287v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) have transformed natural language processing, but their success has not yet translated to time series forecasting. Existing time series foundation models (TSFMs), often based on transformer variants, struggle with generalization across varying context and target lengths, lack adaptability to different sampling rates, and are computationally inefficient. We introduce FlowState, a novel TSFM architecture that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: a state space model (SSM) based encoder and a functional basis decoder. This design enables continuous-time modeling and dynamic time-scale adjustment, allowing FlowState to inherently generalize across all possible temporal resolutions, and dynamically adjust the forecasting horizons. In contrast to other state-of-the-art TSFMs, which require training data across all possible sampling rates to memorize patterns at each scale, FlowState inherently adapts its internal dynamics to the input scale, enabling smaller models, reduced data requirements, and improved efficiency. We further propose an efficient pretraining strategy that improves robustness and accelerates training. Despite being the smallest model, FlowState outperforms all other models and is state-of-the-art for the GIFT-ZS and the Chronos-ZS benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of its components, and we demonstrate its unique ability to adapt online to varying input sampling rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a LSTM-RF hybrid model that combines the advantages of LSTM and RF, which solves the deficiencies of a single model in time-series modelling and nonlinear feature portrayal. Trained with multi-source ocean data(temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, etc.), the experimental results show that the LSTM-RF model has an R^2 of 0.5386, an MSE of 0.005806, and an MAE of 0.057147 on the test set, which is significantly better than using LSTM (R^2 = 0.0208) and RF (R^2 =0.4934) alone , respectively. The standardised treatment and sliding window approach improved the prediction accuracy of the model and provided an innovative solution for high-frequency prediction of marine ecological variables.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE 5th International Conference on Advanced Algorithms and Neural Networks (AANN)</p></details> |
| **[Salt-Rock Creep Deformation Forecasting Using Deep Neural Networks and Analytical Models for Subsurface Energy Storage Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05248v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study provides an in-depth analysis of time series forecasting methods to predict the time-dependent deformation trend (also known as creep) of salt rock under varying confining pressure conditions. Creep deformation assessment is essential for designing and operating underground storage facilities for nuclear waste, hydrogen energy, or radioactive materials. Salt rocks, known for their mechanical properties like low porosity, low permeability, high ductility, and exceptional creep and self-healing capacities, were examined using multi-stage triaxial (MSTL) creep data. After resampling, axial strain datasets were recorded at 5--10 second intervals under confining pressure levels ranging from 5 to 35 MPa over 5.8--21 days. Initial analyses, including Seasonal-Trend Decomposition (STL) and Granger causality tests, revealed minimal seasonality and causality between axial strain and temperature data. Further statistical tests, such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, confirmed the stationarity of the data with p-values less than 0.05, and wavelet coherence plot (WCP) analysis indicated repeating trends. A suite of deep neural network (DNN) models (Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Time Series (N-BEATS), Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Transformers (TF)) was utilized and compared against statistical baseline models. Predictive performance was evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE). Results demonstrated that N-BEATS and TCN models outperformed others across various stress levels, respectively. DNN models, particularly N-BEATS and TCN, showed a 15--20\% improvement in accuracy over traditional analytical models, effectively capturing complex temporal dependencies and patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advanced Hybrid Transformer LSTM Technique with Attention and TS Mixer for Drilling Rate of Penetration Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05210v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Rate of Penetration (ROP) is crucial for optimizing drilling operations; however, accurately predicting it is hindered by the complex, dynamic, and high-dimensional nature of drilling data. Traditional empirical, physics-based, and basic machine learning models often fail to capture intricate temporal and contextual relationships, resulting in suboptimal predictions and limited real-time utility. To address this gap, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning architecture integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Transformer encoders, Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) blocks, and attention mechanisms to synergistically model temporal dependencies, static feature interactions, global context, and dynamic feature importance. Evaluated on a real-world drilling dataset, our model outperformed benchmarks (standalone LSTM, TS-Mixer, and simpler hybrids) with an R-squared score of 0.9988 and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 1.447%, as measured by standard regression metrics (R-squared, MAE, RMSE, MAPE). Model interpretability was ensured using SHAP and LIME, while actual vs. predicted curves and bias checks confirmed accuracy and fairness across scenarios. This advanced hybrid approach enables reliable real-time ROP prediction, paving the way for intelligent, cost-effective drilling optimization systems with significant operational impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 Pa...</summary><p>37 Pages, 19 Figures, 9 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Physical Scales Matter: The Role of Receptive Fields and Advection in Satellite-Based Thunderstorm Nowcasting with Convolutional Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09994v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The focus of nowcasting development is transitioning from physically motivated advection methods to purely data-driven Machine Learning (ML) approaches. Nevertheless, recent work indicates that incorporating advection into the ML value chain has improved skill for radar-based precipitation nowcasts. However, the generality of this approach and the underlying causes remain unexplored. This study investigates the generality by probing the approach on satellite-based thunderstorm nowcasts for the first time. Resorting to a scale argument, we then put forth an explanation when and why skill improvements can be expected. In essence, advection guarantees that thunderstorm patterns relevant for nowcasting are contained in the receptive field at long forecast times. To test our hypotheses, we train ResU-Nets solving segmentation tasks with lightning observations as ground truth. The input of the Baseline Neural Network (BNN) are short time series of multispectral satellite imagery and lightning observations, whereas the Advection-Informed Neural Network (AINN) additionally receives the Lagrangian persistence nowcast of all input channels at the desired forecast time. Overall, we find only a minor skill improvement of the AINN over the BNN when considering fully averaged scores. However, assessing skill conditioned on forecast time and advection speed, we demonstrate that our scale argument correctly predicts the onset of skill improvement of the AINN over the BNN after 2h forecast time. We confirm that, generally, advection becomes gradually more important with longer forecast times and higher advection speeds. Our work accentuates the importance of considering and incorporating the underlying physical scales when designing ML-based forecasting models.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 12 figures, 4 tables.

By combining tensor networks with variational quantum circuits, we demonstrate the potential of QML to tackle complex time series classification and regression tasks. Our results showcase the ability of hybrid quantum tensor networks to achieve high accuracy in binary classification. Furthermore, we observe promising performance in regressing discrete variables. While hyperparameter selection remains a challenge, requiring careful optimisation to unlock the full potential of these models, this work contributes significantly to the development of QML for solving intricate problems in aeroelasticity. We present an end-to-end trainable hybrid algorithm. We first encode time series into tensor networks to then utilise trainable tensor networks for dimensionality reduction, and convert the resulting tensor to a quantum circuit in the encoding step. Then, a tensor network inspired trainable variational quantum circuit is applied to solve either a classification or a multivariate or univariate regression task in the aeroelasticity domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 8 Figures, submitted to Quantum Machine Intelligence</p></details> |

While Differential Privacy (DP) provides theoretical guarantees to protect individual data contributions, its integration especially via DP-SGD often impairs model performance due to injected noise. In this paper, we propose Q-DPTS, a hybrid quantum-classical framework for Quantum Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting. Q-DPTS combines Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with per-sample gradient clipping and Gaussian noise injection, ensuring rigorous $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy. The expressiveness of quantum models enables improved robustness against the utility loss induced by DP mechanisms. We evaluate Q-DPTS on the ETT (Electricity Transformer Temperature) dataset, a standard benchmark for long-term time series forecasting. Our approach is compared against both classical and quantum baselines, including LSTM, QASA, QRWKV, and QLSTM. Results demonstrate that Q-DPTS consistently achieves lower prediction error under the same privacy budget, indicating a favorable privacy-utility trade-off. This work presents one of the first explorations into quantum-enhanced differentially private forecasting, offering promising directions for secure and accurate time series modeling in privacy-critical scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[STARFormer: A Novel Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Reorganization Transformer of FMRI for Brain Disorder Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00378v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many existing methods that use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) classify brain disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), often overlook the integration of spatial and temporal dependencies of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which may lead to inaccurate or imprecise classification results. To solve this problem, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Aggregation eorganization ransformer (STARFormer) that effectively captures both spatial and temporal features of BOLD signals by incorporating three key modules. The region of interest (ROI) spatial structure analysis module uses eigenvector centrality (EC) to reorganize brain regions based on effective connectivity, highlighting critical spatial relationships relevant to the brain disorder. The temporal feature reorganization module systematically segments the time series into equal-dimensional window tokens and captures multiscale features through variable window and cross-window attention. The spatio-temporal feature fusion module employs a parallel transformer architecture with dedicated temporal and spatial branches to extract integrated features. The proposed STARFormer has been rigorously evaluated on two publicly available datasets for the classification of ASD and ADHD. The experimental results confirm that the STARFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, providing a more accurate and reliable tool for the diagnosis of brain disorders and biomedical research. The codes are available at: https://github.com/NZWANG/STARFormer.</p></details> |  |

Eye Tracking-Based Modeling of Situational Awareness in Augmented Reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05025v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Augmented Reality (AR) systems, while enhancing task performance through real-time guidance, pose risks of inducing cognitive tunneling-a hyperfocus on virtual content that compromises situational awareness (SA) in safety-critical scenarios. This paper investigates SA in AR-guided cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), where responders must balance effective compressions with vigilance to unpredictable hazards (e.g., patient vomiting). We developed an AR app on a Magic Leap 2 that overlays real-time CPR feedback (compression depth and rate) and conducted a user study with simulated unexpected incidents (e.g., bleeding) to evaluate SA, in which SA metrics were collected via observation and questionnaires administered during freeze-probe events. Eye tracking analysis revealed that higher SA levels were associated with greater saccadic amplitude and velocity, and with reduced proportion and frequency of fixations on virtual content. To predict SA, we propose FixGraphPool, a graph neural network that structures gaze events (fixations, saccades) into spatiotemporal graphs, effectively capturing dynamic attentional patterns. Our model achieved 83.0% accuracy (F1=81.0%), outperforming feature-based machine learning and state-of-the-art time-series models by leveraging domain knowledge and spatial-temporal information encoded in ET data. These findings demonstrate the potential of eye tracking for SA modeling in AR and highlight its utility in designing AR systems that ensure user safety and situational awareness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse Asymptotic PCA: Identifying Sparse Latent Factors Across Time Horizon in High-Dimensional Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09738v3)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel sparse latent factor modeling framework using sparse asymptotic Principal Component Analysis (APCA) to analyze the co-movements of high-dimensional panel data over time. Unlike existing methods based on sparse PCA, which assume sparsity in the loading matrices, our approach posits sparsity in the factor processes while allowing non-sparse loadings. This is motivated by the fact that financial returns typically exhibit universal and non-sparse exposure to market factors. Unlike the commonly used $\ell_1$-relaxation in sparse PCA, the proposed sparse APCA employs a truncated power method to estimate the leading sparse factor and a sequential deflation method for multi-factor cases under $\ell_0$-constraints. Furthermore, we develop a data-driven approach to identify the sparsity of risk factors over the time horizon using a novel cross-sectional cross-validation method. We establish the consistency of our estimators under mild conditions as both the dimension $N$ and the sample size $T$ grow. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed method performs well in finite samples. Empirically, we apply our method to daily S&P 500 stock returns (2004--2016) and identify nine risk factors influencing the stock market.</p></details> | 69 pages, 6 figures |

Using circuit analysis techniques, we show that a large class of transistor amplifiers can be modeled as Linear Dynamic Influence Model (LDIM), where the interactions between different amplifier stages are modeled as linear dynamic equations. LDIM modeling of transistor circuits leads to application of data-driven network reconstruction techniques to characterize stage interactions and identify faults and critical circuit parameters efficiently. Employing graphical modeling techniques and Wiener filtering, we demonstrate that the network structure can be reconstructed solely from voltage time-series measurements sampled at specified points in the circuit. The efficacy of these network reconstruction methods in multistage amplifiers is demonstrated through extensive simulations involving multiple amplifier circuits in Cadence, as well as experimental results on physical hardware. The ability to infer network structure directly from measurement data offers designers and users efficient tools to design, analyze, and debug amplifier circuits. To demonstrate the utility of network reconstruction in multistage amplifier circuits, a fault diagnosis method leveraging these techniques is presented.</p></details> |  |

A Study on Water Level Forecasting in Everglades](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01415v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Everglades play a crucial role in flood and drought regulation, water resource planning, and ecosystem management in the surrounding regions. However, traditional physics-based and statistical methods for predicting water levels often face significant challenges, including high computational costs and limited adaptability to diverse or unforeseen conditions. Recent advancements in large time series models have demonstrated the potential to address these limitations, with state-of-the-art deep learning and foundation models achieving remarkable success in time series forecasting across various domains. Despite this progress, their application to critical environmental systems, such as the Everglades, remains underexplored. In this study, we fill the gap by investigating twelve task-specific models and five time series foundation models across six categories for a real-world application focused on water level prediction in the Everglades. Our primary results show that the foundation model Chronos significantly outperforms all other models while the remaining foundation models exhibit relatively poor performance. We also noticed that the performance of task-specific models varies with the model architectures, and discussed the possible reasons. We hope our study and findings will inspire the community to explore the applicability of large time series models in hydrological applications.

While recent advances in deep learning, particularly time series foundation models, have demonstrated success in general-domain forecasting, their application in hydrology remains underexplored. Furthermore, they often struggle to generalize across diverse unseen datasets and domains, due to the lack of effective mechanisms for adaptation. To address this gap, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting (RAF) into the hydrology domain, proposing a framework that retrieves historically analogous multivariate hydrological episodes to enrich the model input before forecasting. By maintaining an external archive of past observations, RAF identifies and incorporates relevant patterns from historical data, thereby enhancing contextual awareness and predictive accuracy without requiring the model for task-specific retraining or fine-tuning. Furthermore, we explore and compare both similarity-based and mutual information-based RAF methods. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on real-world data from the Everglades, demonstrating that the RAF framework yields substantial improvements in water level forecasting accuracy. This study highlights the potential of RAF approaches in environmental hydrology and paves the way for broader adoption of adaptive AI methods by domain experts in ecosystem management.

While recent advances in deep learning and foundation models have led to substantial improvements in general time series forecasting, most existing approaches fail to capture the complex spatial interdependencies and uncertainty inherent in electricity markets. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing a comprehensive and up-to-date dataset across 24 European countries (38 regions), spanning from 2022-01-01 to 2025-01-01.

We propose a process modeling framework enabling integration of data-driven algorithms through consistent topological properties and conservation of extensive quantities. Interconnections among process network units are represented through connectivity matrices and network graphs. We derive the system's natural objective function equivalent to the non-equilibrium entropy production in a steady state system as a driving force for the process dynamics. We illustrate how distributed control and optimization can be implemented into process network structures and how control laws and algorithms alter the system's natural equilibrium towards engineered objectives. The basic requirement is that the flow conditions can be expressed in terms of conic sector (passivity) conditions. Our formalism allows integration of fundamental conservation properties from topology with learned dynamic relations from data through sparse deep neural networks. We demonstrate in a practical example of a simple inventory control system how to integrate the basic topology of a process with a neural network ordinary differential equation model. The system specific constitutive equations are left undescribed and learned by the neural ordinary differential equation algorithm using the adjoint method in combination with an adaptive ODE solver from synthetic time-series data. The resulting neural network forms a state space model for use in e.g. a model predictive control algorithm.</p></details> | 27 pages, 7 figures |
| **[CaPulse: Detecting Anomalies by Tuning in to the Causal Rhythms of Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04630v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection has garnered considerable attention across diverse domains. While existing methods often fail to capture the underlying mechanisms behind anomaly generation in time series data. In addition, time series anomaly detection often faces several data-related inherent challenges, i.e., label scarcity, data imbalance, and complex multi-periodicity. In this paper, we leverage causal tools and introduce a new causality-based framework, CaPulse, which tunes in to the underlying causal pulse of time series data to effectively detect anomalies. Concretely, we begin by building a structural causal model to decipher the generation processes behind anomalies. To tackle the challenges posed by the data, we propose Periodical Normalizing Flows with a novel mask mechanism and carefully designed periodical learners, creating a periodicity-aware, density-based anomaly detection approach. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that CaPulse consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving AUROC improvements of 3% to 17%, with enhanced interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Remaining Useful Life Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04336v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) plays a crucial role in the prognostics and health management of industrial systems that involve a variety of interrelated sensors. Given a constant stream of time series sensory data from such systems, deep learning models have risen to prominence at identifying complex, nonlinear temporal dependencies in these data. In addition to the temporal dependencies of individual sensors, spatial dependencies emerge as important correlations among these sensors, which can be naturally modelled by a temporal graph that describes time-varying spatial relationships. However, the majority of existing studies have relied on capturing discrete snapshots of this temporal graph, a coarse-grained approach that leads to loss of temporal information. Moreover, given the variety of heterogeneous sensors, it becomes vital that such inherent heterogeneity is leveraged for RUL prediction in temporal sensor graphs. To capture the nuances of the temporal and spatial relationships and heterogeneous characteristics in an interconnected graph of sensors, we introduce a novel model named Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (THGNN). Specifically, THGNN aggregates historical data from neighboring nodes to accurately capture the temporal dynamics and spatial correlations within the stream of sensor data in a fine-grained manner. Moreover, the model leverages Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to address the diversity of sensor types, significantly improving the model's capacity to learn the heterogeneity in the data sources. Finally, we have validated the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments. Our empirical findings demonstrate significant advancements on the N-CMAPSS dataset, achieving improvements of up to 19.2% and 31.6% in terms of two different evaluation metrics over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Such models typically require a computationally costly pretraining on large-scale, carefully curated collections of real-world sequences. To allow for a sample-efficient pretraining of TSFMs, we propose CauKer, a novel algorithm designed to generate diverse, causally coherent synthetic time series with realistic trends, seasonality, and nonlinear interactions. CauKer combines Gaussian Process (GP) kernel composition with Structural Causal Models (SCM) to produce data for sample-efficient pretraining of state-of-the-art classification TSFMs having different architectures and following different pretraining approaches. Additionally, our experiments reveal that CauKer-generated datasets exhibit clear scaling laws for both dataset size (10K to 10M samples) and model capacity (1M to 783M parameters), unlike real-world datasets, which display irregular scaling behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[PRISM: Lightweight Multivariate Time-Series Classification through Symmetric Multi-Resolution Convolutional Layers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04503v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time-series classification is pivotal in domains ranging from wearable sensing to biomedical monitoring. Despite recent advances, Transformer- and CNN-based models often remain computationally heavy, offer limited frequency diversity, and require extensive parameter budgets. We propose PRISM (Per-channel Resolution-Informed Symmetric Module), a convolutional-based feature extractor that applies symmetric finite-impulse-response (FIR) filters at multiple temporal scales, independently per channel. This multi-resolution, per-channel design yields highly frequency-selective embeddings without any inter-channel convolutions, greatly reducing model size and complexity. Across human-activity, sleep-stage and biomedical benchmarks, PRISM, paired with lightweight classification heads, matches or outperforms leading CNN and Transformer baselines, while using roughly an order of magnitude fewer parameters and FLOPs. By uniting classical signal processing insights with modern deep learning, PRISM offers an accurate, resource-efficient solution for multivariate time-series classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Quantum and Classical Sequential Models for Urban Telecommunication Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04488v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we evaluate the performance of classical and quantum-inspired sequential models in forecasting univariate time series of incoming SMS activity (SMS-in) using the Milan Telecommunication Activity Dataset. Due to data completeness limitations, we focus exclusively on the SMS-in signal for each spatial grid cell. We compare five models, LSTM (baseline), Quantum LSTM (QLSTM), Quantum Adaptive Self-Attention (QASA), Quantum Receptance Weighted Key-Value (QRWKV), and Quantum Fast Weight Programmers (QFWP), under varying input sequence lengths (4, 8, 12, 16, 32 and 64). All models are trained to predict the next 10-minute SMS-in value based solely on historical values within a given sequence window. Our findings indicate that different models exhibit varying sensitivities to sequence length, suggesting that quantum enhancements are not universally advantageous. Rather, the effectiveness of quantum modules is highly dependent on the specific task and architectural design, reflecting inherent trade-offs among model size, parameterization strategies, and temporal modeling capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Series Transformer-Based Modeling of Pavement Skid and Texture Deterioration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01842v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the deterioration of skid resistance and surface macrotexture following preventive maintenance using micro-milling techniques. Field data were collected from 31 asphalt pavement sections located across four climatic zones in Texas. The data encompasses a variety of surface types, milling depths, operational speeds, and drum configurations. A standardized data collection protocol was followed, with measurements taken before milling, immediately after treatment, and at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months post-treatment. Skid number and Mean Profile Depth (MPD) were used to evaluate surface friction and texture characteristics. The dataset was reformatted into a time-series structure with 930 observations, including contextual variables such as climatic zone, treatment parameters, and baseline surface condition. A comparative modeling framework was applied to predict the deterioration trends of both skid resistance and macrotexture over time. Eight regression models, including linear, tree-based, and ensemble methods, were evaluated alongside a time series transformer model. Results show that the transformer model achieved the highest prediction accuracy for skid resistance (R2 = 0.981), while Random Forest performing best for macrotexture prediction (R2 = 0.838). The findings indicate that the degradation of surface characteristics after preventive maintenance is nonlinear and influenced by a combination of environmental and operational factors. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of data-driven modeling in supporting transportation agencies with pavement performance forecasting and maintenance planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[VisionTS++: Cross-Modal Time Series Foundation Model with Continual Pre-trained Visual Backbones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04379v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have revealed that vision models pre-trained on images can perform well in time series forecasting by reformulating forecasting as an image reconstruction task, suggesting their potential as universal time series foundation models. However, effective cross-modal transfer from vision to time series remains challenging due to three key discrepancies: (1) data-modality gap between structured, bounded image data and unbounded, heterogeneous time series; (2) multivariate-forecasting gap between standard RGB three-channel-based vision models and the need to model time series with arbitrary numbers of variates; and (3) probabilistic-forecasting gap between the deterministic output formats of most vision models and the requirement for uncertainty-aware probabilistic predictions. To bridge these gaps, we propose VisionTS++, a vision-model-based TSFM that performs continual pre-training on large-scale time series datasets, including 3 innovations: (1) a vision-model-based filtering mechanism to identify high-quality time series data, thereby mitigating modality gap and improving pre-training stability, (2) a colorized multivariate conversion method that transforms multivariate time series into multi-subfigure RGB images, capturing complex inter-variate dependencies; and (3) a multi-quantile forecasting approach using parallel reconstruction heads to generate forecasts of different quantile levels, thus more flexibly approximating arbitrary output distributions without restrictive prior distributional assumptions. Evaluated on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution TSF benchmarks, \model achieves SOTA results, outperforming specialized TSFMs by 6%-44% in MSE reduction and ranking first in 9 out of 12 probabilistic forecasting settings. Our work establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal knowledge transfer, advancing the development of universal TSFMs.</p></details> | 21 pages |

Although some covariates extend into the future forecasting horizon (e.g., calendar events, discount schedules), most multivariate models fail to leverage this pivotal insight due to the length discrepancy with target variables. Additionally, capturing the dependency between target variables and covariates is non-trivial, as models must precisely reflect the local impact of covariates while also capturing global cross-variate dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we propose CITRAS, a decoder-only Transformer that flexibly leverages multiple targets, past covariates, and future covariates. While preserving strong autoregressive capabilities, CITRAS introduces two novel mechanisms in patch-wise cross-variate attention: Key-Value (KV) Shift and Attention Score Smoothing. KV Shift seamlessly incorporates future covariates into the forecasting of target variables based on their concurrent dependencies. Additionally, Attention Score Smoothing refines locally accurate patch-wise cross-variate dependencies into global variate-level dependencies by smoothing the past series of attention scores. Experimentally, CITRAS outperforms state-of-the-art models on thirteen real-world benchmarks from both covariate-informed and multivariate settings, demonstrating its versatile ability to leverage cross-variate and cross-time dependencies for improved forecasting accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submission under review</p></details> |

This paper proposes a binaural sound event localization and detection (BiSELD) neural network to address these challenges. BiSELDnet learns time-frequency patterns and head-related transfer function (HRTF) localization cues from binaural input features. A novel eight-channel binaural time-frequency feature (BTFF) is introduced, comprising left/right mel-spectrograms, V-maps, an interaural time difference (ITD) map (below 1.5 kHz), an interaural level difference (ILD) map (above 5 kHz with front-back asymmetry), and spectral cue (SC) maps (above 5 kHz for elevation). The effectiveness of BTFF was confirmed across omnidirectional, horizontal, and median planes. BiSELDnets, particularly one based on the efficient Trinity module, were implemented to output time series of direction vectors for each sound event class, enabling simultaneous detection and localization. Vector activation map (VAM) visualization was proposed to analyze network learning, confirming BiSELDnet's focus on the N1 notch frequency for elevation estimation. Comparative evaluations under urban background noise conditions demonstrated that the proposed BiSELD model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) SELD models with binaural input.</p></details> | 200 pages |

| **[Generalising Traffic Forecasting to Regions without Traffic Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08947v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation systems. Accurate forecasting relies on continuous observations collected by traffic sensors. However, due to high deployment and maintenance costs, not all regions are equipped with such sensors. This paper aims to forecast for regions without traffic sensors, where the lack of historical traffic observations challenges the generalisability of existing models. We propose a model named GenCast, the core idea of which is to exploit external knowledge to compensate for the missing observations and to enhance generalisation. We integrate physics-informed neural networks into GenCast, enabling physical principles to regularise the learning process. We introduce an external signal learning module to explore correlations between traffic states and external signals such as weather conditions, further improving model generalisability. Additionally, we design a spatial grouping module to filter localised features that hinder model generalisability. Extensive experiments show that GenCast consistently reduces forecasting errors on multiple real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, jointly controlling both in real-time to alleviate traffic congestion presents new challenges, such as the inherent physical and behavioral heterogeneity between signal control and platooning, as well as coordination between them. This paper proposes an innovative solution to tackle these challenges based on heterogeneous graph multi-agent reinforcement learning and traffic theories. Our approach involves: 1) designing platoon and signal control as distinct reinforcement learning agents with their own set of observations, actions, and reward functions to optimize traffic flow; 2) designing coordination by incorporating graph neural networks within multi-agent reinforcement learning to facilitate seamless information exchange among agents on a regional scale; 3) applying alternating optimization for training, allowing agents to update their own policies and adapt to other agents' policies. We evaluate our approach through SUMO simulations, which show convergent results in terms of both travel time and fuel consumption, and superior performance compared to other adaptive signal control methods.</p></details> |  |

However, it encounters significant challenges including harsh communication environments, limited energy supply, and restricted signal transmission. This paper aims to provide efficient and reliable communication in underwater networks with limited energy and communication resources by optimizing the scheduling of communication links and adjusting transmission parameters (e.g., transmit power and transmission rate). The efficient and reliable communication multi-objective optimization problem (ERCMOP) is formulated as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP). A Traffic Load-Aware Resource Management (TARM) strategy based on deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is presented to address this problem. Specifically, a traffic load-aware mechanism that leverages the overhear information from neighboring nodes is designed to mitigate the disparity between partial observations and global states. Moreover, by incorporating a solution space optimization algorithm, the number of candidate solutions for the deep MARL-based decision-making model can be effectively reduced, thereby optimizing the computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the adaptability of TARM in various scenarios with different transmission demands and collision probabilities, while also validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in supporting efficient and reliable communication in underwater networks with limited resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</p></details> |

These limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction performance and lightweight deployment.</p></details> |  |

One crucial step is modeling the volume of traffic demand. But past demand modeling approaches have relied on unrealistic or suboptimal heuristics, and they have failed to adequately account for the effects of noisy and multimodal data on simulation outcomes. In this work, we integrate advances in AI to construct a three-step, end-to-end pipeline for systematically modeling traffic demand from detector data: computer vision for vehicle counting from noisy camera footage, combinatorial optimization for vehicle route generation from multimodal data, and large language models for iterative simulation refinement from natural language feedback. Using a road network from Strongsville, Ohio as a testbed, we show that our pipeline accurately captures the city's traffic patterns in a granular simulation. Beyond Strongsville, incorporating noise and multimodality makes our framework generalizable to municipalities with different levels of data and infrastructure availability.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages; 1 table; 6 figures; extended version of accepted version, published at the 2025 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC '25)</p></details> |
| **[A Physics-informed Deep Operator for Real-Time Freeway Traffic State Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08002v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic state estimation (TSE) falls methodologically into three categories: model-driven, data-driven, and model-data dual-driven. Model-driven TSE relies on macroscopic traffic flow models originated from hydrodynamics. Data-driven TSE leverages historical sensing data and employs statistical models or machine learning methods to infer traffic state. Model-data dual-driven traffic state estimation attempts to harness the strengths of both aspects to achieve more accurate TSE. From the perspective of mathematical operator theory, TSE can be viewed as a type of operator that maps available measurements of inerested traffic state into unmeasured traffic state variables in real time. For the first time this paper proposes to study real-time freeway TSE in the idea of physics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet), which is an operator-oriented architecture embedding traffic flow models based on deep neural networks. The paper has developed an extended architecture from the original PI-DeepONet. The extended architecture is featured with: (1) the acceptance of 2-D data input so as to support CNN-based computations; (2) the introduction of a nonlinear expansion layer, an attention mechanism, and a MIMO mechanism; (3) dedicated neural network design for adaptive identification of traffic flow model parameters. A traffic state estimator built on the basis of this extended PI-DeepONet architecture was evaluated with respect to a short freeway stretch of NGSIM and a large-scale urban expressway in China, along with other four baseline TSE methods. The evaluation results demonstrated that this novel TSE method outperformed the baseline methods with high-precision estimation results of flow and mean speed.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Noise-Aware Generative Microscopic Traffic Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07453v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately modeling individual vehicle behavior in microscopic traffic simulation remains a key challenge in intelligent transportation systems, as it requires vehicles to realistically generate and respond to complex traffic phenomena such as phantom traffic jams. While traditional human driver simulation models offer computational tractability, they do so by abstracting away the very complexity that defines human driving. On the other hand, recent advances in infrastructure-mounted camera-based roadway sensing have enabled the extraction of vehicle trajectory data, presenting an opportunity to shift toward generative, agent-based models. Yet, a major bottleneck remains: most existing datasets are either overly sanitized or lack standardization, failing to reflect the noisy, imperfect nature of real-world sensing. Unlike data from vehicle-mounted sensors-which can mitigate sensing artifacts like occlusion through overlapping fields of view and sensor fusion-infrastructure-based sensors surface a messier, more practical view of challenges that traffic engineers encounter. To this end, we present the I-24 MOTION Scenario Dataset (I24-MSD)-a standardized, curated dataset designed to preserve a realistic level of sensor imperfection, embracing these errors as part of the learning problem rather than an obstacle to overcome purely from preprocessing. Drawing from noise-aware learning strategies in computer vision, we further adapt existing generative models in the autonomous driving community for I24-MSD with noise-aware loss functions. Our results show that such models not only outperform traditional baselines in realism but also benefit from explicitly engaging with, rather than suppressing, data imperfection. We view I24-MSD as a stepping stone toward a new generation of microscopic traffic simulation that embraces the real-world challenges and is better aligned with practical needs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Traffic Oscillations in Mixed Traffic Flow with Scalable Deep Koopman Predictive Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00043v3)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mitigating traffic oscillations in mixed flows of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) is critical for enhancing traffic stability. A key challenge lies in modeling the nonlinear, heterogeneous behaviors of HDVs within computationally tractable predictive control frameworks. This study proposes an adaptive deep Koopman predictive control framework (AdapKoopPC) to address this issue. The framework features a novel deep Koopman network, AdapKoopnet, which represents complex HDV car-following dynamics as a linear system in a high-dimensional space by adaptively learning from naturalistic data. This learned linear representation is then embedded into a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme, enabling real-time, scalable, and optimal control of CAVs. We validate our framework using the HighD dataset and extensive numerical simulations. Results demonstrate that AdapKoopnet achieves superior trajectory prediction accuracy over baseline models. Furthermore, the complete AdapKoopPC controller significantly dampens traffic oscillations with lower computational cost, exhibiting strong performance even at low CAV penetration rates. The proposed framework offers a scalable and data-driven solution for enhancing stability in realistic mixed traffic environments. The code is made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Competition Helps: Achieving Optimal Traffic Flow with Multiple Autonomous Planners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07145v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inefficiency of selfish routing in congested networks is a classical problem in algorithmic game theory, often captured by the Price of Anarchy (i.e., the ratio between the social cost of decentralized decisions and that of a centrally optimized solution.) With the advent of autonomous vehicles, capable of receiving and executing centrally assigned routes, it is natural to ask whether their deployment can eliminate this inefficiency. At first glance, a central authority could simply compute an optimal traffic assignment and instruct each vehicle to follow its assigned path. However, this vision overlooks critical challenges: routes must be individually rational (no vehicle has an incentive to deviate), and in practice, multiple planning agents (e.g., different companies) may coexist and compete. Surprisingly, we show that such competition is not merely an obstacle but a necessary ingredient for achieving optimal outcomes. In this work, we design a routing mechanism that embraces competition and converges to an optimal assignment, starting from the classical Pigou network as a foundational case.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models are often task-oriented and are trained with tailored data, which limits their effectiveness in diverse mobile network tasks of Base Station (BS) deployment, resource allocation, energy optimization, etc. and hinders generalization across different urban environments. Foundation models have made remarkable strides across various domains of NLP and CV due to their multi-tasking adaption and zero/few-shot learning capabilities. In this paper, we propose an innovative Foundation model for Mo}bile traffic forecasting (FoMo), aiming to handle diverse forecasting tasks of short/long-term predictions and distribution generation across multiple cities to support network planning and optimization. FoMo combines diffusion models and transformers, where various spatio-temporal masks are proposed to enable FoMo to learn intrinsic features of different tasks, and a contrastive learning strategy is developed to capture the correlations between mobile traffic and urban contexts, thereby improving its transfer learning capability. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world datasets demonstrate that FoMo outperforms current models concerning diverse forecasting tasks and zero/few-shot learning, showcasing a strong universality.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, KDD 2025</p></details> |

While Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have shown benefits in modeling complex traffic dependencies, the existing GCN-based approaches cannot fully extract and fuse multi-granular spatiotemporal features across various spatial and temporal scales sufficiently in a complete manner, proven to yield less accurate results. Besides, as extracting multi-granular features across scales has been a promising strategy across domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, and time-series forecasting, pioneering studies have attempted to leverage a similar mechanism for spatiotemporal traffic data mining. However, additional feature extraction branches introduced in prior studies critically increased model complexity and extended inference time, making it challenging to provide fast forecasts. In this paper, we propose MultiGran-STGCNFog, an efficient fog distributed inference system with a novel traffic forecasting model that employs multi-granular spatiotemporal feature fusion on generated dynamic traffic graphs to fully capture interdependent traffic dynamics. The proposed scheduling algorithm GA-DPHDS, optimizing layer execution order and layer-device scheduling scheme simultaneously, contributes to considerable inference throughput improvement by coordinating heterogeneous fog devices in a pipelined manner. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over selected GCN baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 34th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2025)</p></details> |

However, existing MLLMs in this domain primarily focus on coarse-grained image-level or video-level comprehension and often struggle to handle fine-grained visual details or localized scene components, limiting their applicability in complex accident scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose SafePLUG, a novel framework that empowers MLLMs with both Pixel-Level Understanding and temporal Grounding for comprehensive traffic accident analysis. SafePLUG supports both arbitrary-shaped visual prompts for region-aware question answering and pixel-level segmentation based on language instructions, while also enabling the recognition of temporally anchored events in traffic accident scenarios. To advance the development of MLLMs for traffic accident understanding, we curate a new dataset containing multimodal question-answer pairs centered on diverse accident scenarios, with detailed pixel-level annotations and temporal event boundaries. Experimental results show that SafePLUG achieves strong performance on multiple tasks, including region-based question answering, pixel-level segmentation, temporal event localization, and accident event understanding. These capabilities lay a foundation for fine-grained understanding of complex traffic scenes, with the potential to improve driving safety and enhance situational awareness in smart transportation systems.

An advertising campaign hopes to maximize the effect (such as conversions) under constraints (such as budget and cost-per-click). The mainstream control of campaigns is auto-bidding, where the performance depends on the decision of the bidding algorithm in each request. The most widely used auto-bidding algorithms include Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control, linear programming (LP), reinforcement learning (RL), etc. Existing methods either do not consider the entire time traffic, or have too high computational complexity. In this paper, the live advertising has high requirements for real-time bidding (second-level control) and faces the difficulty of unknown future traffic. Therefore, we propose a lightweight bidding algorithm Binary Constrained Bidding (BiCB), which neatly combines the optimal bidding formula given by mathematical analysis and the statistical method of future traffic estimation, and obtains good approximation to the optimal result through a low complexity solution. In addition, we complement the form of upper and lower bound constraints for traditional auto-bidding modeling and give theoretical analysis of BiCB.

Deep learning has advanced video-based traffic monitoring through video question answering (VideoQA) models, enabling structured insight extraction from traffic videos. However, existing VideoQA models struggle with the complexity of real-world traffic scenes, where multiple concurrent events unfold across spatiotemporal dimensions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \textbf{InterAct VideoQA}, a curated dataset designed to benchmark and enhance VideoQA models for traffic monitoring tasks. The InterAct VideoQA dataset comprises 8 hours of real-world traffic footage collected from diverse intersections, segmented into 10-second video clips, with over 25,000 question-answer (QA) pairs covering spatiotemporal dynamics, vehicle interactions, incident detection, and other critical traffic attributes. State-of-the-art VideoQA models are evaluated on InterAct VideoQA, exposing challenges in reasoning over fine-grained spatiotemporal dependencies within complex traffic scenarios. Additionally, fine-tuning these models on InterAct VideoQA yields notable performance improvements, demonstrating the necessity of domain-specific datasets for VideoQA. InterAct VideoQA is publicly available as a benchmark dataset to facilitate future research in real-world deployable VideoQA models for intelligent transportation systems.

| **[Spatio-Temporal Partial Sensing Forecast for Long-term Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02689v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting uses recent measurements by sensors installed at chosen locations to forecast the future road traffic. Existing work either assumes all locations are equipped with sensors or focuses on short-term forecast. This paper studies partial sensing forecast of long-term traffic, assuming sensors are available only at some locations. The problem is challenging due to the unknown data distribution at unsensed locations, the intricate spatio-temporal correlation in long-term forecasting, as well as noise to traffic patterns. We propose a Spatio-temporal Long-term Partial sensing Forecast model (SLPF) for traffic prediction, with several novel contributions, including a rank-based embedding technique to reduce the impact of noise in data, a spatial transfer matrix to overcome the spatial distribution shift from sensed locations to unsensed locations, and a multi-step training process that utilizes all available data to successively refine the model parameters for better accuracy. Extensive experiments on several real-world traffic datasets demonstrate its superior performance.

| **[Channel-Independent Federated Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04517v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, traffic prediction has achieved remarkable success and has become an integral component of intelligent transportation systems. However, traffic data is typically distributed among multiple data owners, and privacy constraints prevent the direct utilization of these isolated datasets for traffic prediction. Most existing federated traffic prediction methods focus on designing communication mechanisms that allow models to leverage information from other clients in order to improve prediction accuracy. Unfortunately, such approaches often incur substantial communication overhead, and the resulting transmission delays significantly slow down the training process. As the volume of traffic data continues to grow, this issue becomes increasingly critical, making the resource consumption of current methods unsustainable. To address this challenge, we propose a novel variable relationship modeling paradigm for federated traffic prediction, termed the Channel-Independent Paradigm(CIP). Unlike traditional approaches, CIP eliminates the need for inter-client communication by enabling each node to perform efficient and accurate predictions using only local information. Based on the CIP, we further develop Fed-CI, an efficient federated learning framework, allowing each client to process its own data independently while effectively mitigating the information loss caused by the lack of direct data sharing among clients. Fed-CI significantly reduces communication overhead, accelerates the training process, and achieves state-of-the-art performance while complying with privacy regulations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that Fed-CI consistently outperforms existing methods across all datasets and federated settings. It achieves improvements of 8%, 14%, and 16% in RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, respectively, while also substantially reducing communication costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reconstructing Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Traffic Flow Modeling: a Multi-Gradient Descent and Pareto Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13241v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is crucial in modern traffic flow modeling because it combines the benefits of both physics-based and data-driven approaches. In conventional PIML, physical information is typically incorporated by constructing a hybrid loss function that combines data-driven loss and physics loss through linear scalarization. The goal is to find a trade-off between these two objectives to improve the accuracy of model predictions. However, from a mathematical perspective, linear scalarization is limited to identifying only the convex region of the Pareto front, as it treats data-driven and physics losses as separate objectives. Given that most PIML loss functions are non-convex, linear scalarization restricts the achievable trade-off solutions. Moreover, tuning the weighting coefficients for the two loss components can be both time-consuming and computationally challenging. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a paradigm shift in PIML by reformulating the training process as a multi-objective optimization problem, treating data-driven loss and physics loss independently. We apply several multi-gradient descent algorithms (MGDAs), including traditional multi-gradient descent (TMGD) and dual cone gradient descent (DCGD), to explore the Pareto front in this multi-objective setting. These methods are evaluated on both macroscopic and microscopic traffic flow models. In the macroscopic case, MGDAs achieved comparable performance to traditional linear scalarization methods. Notably, in the microscopic case, MGDAs significantly outperformed their scalarization-based counterparts, demonstrating the advantages of a multi-objective optimization approach in complex PIML scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Given the prohibitive computational cost of learning individual policies for each intersection, some researchers explore learning a universal policy to control each intersection in a decentralized manner, where the key challenge is to construct a universal representation method for heterogeneous intersections. However, existing methods are limited to universally representing information of heterogeneous ego intersections, neglecting the essential representation of influence from their heterogeneous neighbors. Universally incorporating neighborhood information is nontrivial due to the intrinsic complexity of traffic flow interactions, as well as the challenge of modeling collective influences from neighbor intersections. To address these challenges, we propose CityLight, which learns a universal policy based on representations obtained with two major modules: a Neighbor Influence Encoder to explicitly model neighbor's influence with specified traffic flow relation and connectivity to the ego intersection; a Neighbor Influence Aggregator to attentively aggregate the influence of neighbors based on their mutual competitive relations. Extensive experiments on five city-scale datasets, ranging from 97 to 13,952 intersections, confirm the efficacy of CityLight, with an average throughput improvement of 11.68% and a lift of 22.59% for generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |

Prior models and benchmarks focus on closed-loop motion simulation for initial agents in a scene. This is problematic for long-term simulation. Agents enter and exit the scene as the ego vehicle enters new regions. We propose InfGen, a unified next-token prediction model that performs interleaved closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation. InfGen automatically switches between closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation mode. It enables stable long-term rollout simulation. InfGen performs at the state-of-the-art in short-term (9s) traffic simulation, and significantly outperforms all other methods in long-term (30s) simulation.

While most existing attacks exploit ML techniques for discovering such traffic patterns, they underperform on wireless traffic, especially Wi-Fi, due to its heavy noise and packet losses of wireless sniffing. In addition, these approaches commonly target at distinguishing chunked IoT event traffic samples, and they failed at effectively tracking multiple events simultaneously. In this work, we propose WiFinger, a fine-grained multi-IoT event fingerprinting approach against noisy traffic. WiFinger turns the traffic pattern classification task into a subsequence matching problem and introduces novel techniques to account for the high time complexity while maintaining high accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on Wi-Fi traffic, achieving an average recall of 85% (vs. 0.49% and 0.46%) for various IoT events while maintaining almost zero false positives for most of them.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIDAR: Mimicking LiDAR Detection for Traffic Applications with a Lightweight Plug-and-Play Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02858v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As autonomous driving (AD) technology advances, increasing research has focused on leveraging cooperative perception (CP) data collected from multiple AVs to enhance traffic applications. Due to the impracticality of large-scale real-world AV deployments, simulation has become the primary approach in most studies. While game-engine-based simulators like CARLA generate high-fidelity raw sensor data (e.g., LiDAR point clouds) which can be used to produce realistic detection outputs, they face scalability challenges in multi-AV scenarios. In contrast, microscopic traffic simulators such as SUMO scale efficiently but lack perception modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we propose MIDAR, a LiDAR detection mimicking model that approximates realistic LiDAR detections using vehicle-level features readily available from microscopic traffic simulators. Specifically, MIDAR predicts true positives (TPs) and false negatives (FNs) from ideal LiDAR detection results based on the spatial layouts and dimensions of surrounding vehicles. A Refined Multi-hop Line-of-Sight (RM-LoS) graph is constructed to encode the occlusion relationships among vehicles, upon which MIDAR employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP architecture to propagate features from the ego AV and occluding vehicles to the prediction target. MIDAR achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating the detection results generated by CenterPoint, a mainstream 3D LiDAR detection model, on the nuScenes AD dataset. Two CP-based traffic applications further validate the necessity of such realistic detection modeling, particularly for tasks requiring accurate individual vehicle observations (e.g., position, speed, lane index). As demonstrated in the applications, MIDAR can be seamlessly integrated into traffic simulators and trajectory datasets and will be open-sourced upon publication.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |

In this paper, we introduce Traffic-R1, a foundation model with human-like reasoning for TSC systems. Our model is developed through self-exploration and iteration of reinforced large language models (LLMs) with expert guidance in a simulated traffic environment. Compared to traditional reinforcement learning (RL) and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers three significant advantages. First, Traffic-R1 delivers zero-shot generalisation, transferring unchanged to new road networks and out-of-distribution incidents by utilizing its internal traffic control policies and human-like reasoning. Second, its 3B-parameter architecture is lightweight enough for real-time inference on mobile-class chips, enabling large-scale edge deployment. Third, Traffic-R1 provides an explainable TSC process and facilitates multi-intersection communication through its self-iteration and a new synchronous communication network. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that Traffic-R1 sets a new state of the art, outperforming strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In practice, the model now manages signals for more than 55,000 drivers daily, shortening average queues by over 5% and halving operator workload.

| **[Distillation-Enhanced Clustering Acceleration for Encrypted Traffic Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02282v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic classification plays a significant role in network service management. The advancement of deep learning has established pretrained models as a robust approach for this task. However, contemporary encrypted traffic classification systems face dual limitations. Firstly, pretrained models typically exhibit large-scale architectures, where their extensive parameterization results in slow inference speeds and high computational latency. Secondly, reliance on labeled data for fine-tuning restricts these models to predefined supervised classes, creating a bottleneck when novel traffic types emerge in the evolving Internet landscape. To address these challenges, we propose NetClus, a novel framework integrating pretrained models with distillation-enhanced clustering acceleration. During fine-tuning, NetClus first introduces a cluster-friendly loss to jointly reshape the latent space for both classification and clustering. With the fine-tuned model, it distills the model into a lightweight Feed-Forward Neural Network model to retain semantics. During inference, NetClus performs heuristic merge with near-linear runtime, and valid the cluster purity with newly proposed metrics ASI to identify emergent traffic types while expediting classification. Benchmarked against existing pretrained methods, NetClus achieves up to 6.2x acceleration while maintaining classification degradation below 1%.</p></details> | Under review |

To address this, we introduce a novel, end-to-end approach, AirTrafficGen, that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate and control the generation of complex ATC scenarios. Our method uses a purpose-built, graph-based representation to encode sector topology (including airspace geometry, routes, and fixes) into a format LLMs can process. Through rigorous benchmarking, we show that state-of-the-art models like Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 can generate high-traffic scenarios whilst maintaining operational realism. Our engineered prompting enables fine-grained control over interaction presence, type, and location. Initial findings suggest these models are also capable of iterative refinement, correcting flawed scenarios based on simple textual feedback. This approach provides a scalable alternative to manual scenario design, addressing the need for a greater volume and variety of ATC training and validation simulations. More broadly, this work showcases the potential of LLMs for complex planning in safety-critical domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages and appendices</p></details> |
| **[Real-Time Conflict Prediction for Large Truck Merging in Mixed Traffic at Work Zone Lane Closures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02109v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large trucks substantially contribute to work zone-related crashes, primarily due to their large size and blind spots. When approaching a work zone, large trucks often need to merge into an adjacent lane because of lane closures caused by construction activities. This study aims to enhance the safety of large truck merging maneuvers in work zones by evaluating the risk associated with merging conflicts and establishing a decision-making strategy for merging based on this risk assessment. To predict the risk of large trucks merging into a mixed traffic stream within a work zone, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is employed. For a large truck intending to merge, it is critical that the immediate downstream vehicle in the target lane maintains a minimum safe gap to facilitate a safe merging process. Once a conflict-free merging opportunity is predicted, large trucks are instructed to merge in response to the lane closure. Our LSTM-based conflict prediction method is compared against baseline approaches, which include probabilistic risk-based merging, 50th percentile gap-based merging, and 85th percentile gap-based merging strategies. The results demonstrate that our method yields a lower conflict risk, as indicated by reduced Time Exposed Time-to-Collision (TET) and Time Integrated Time-to-Collision (TIT) values relative to the baseline models. Furthermore, the findings indicate that large trucks that use our method can perform early merging while still in motion, as opposed to coming to a complete stop at the end of the current lane prior to closure, which is commonly observed with the baseline approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Traffic Scene Generation from Natural Language Description for Autonomous Vehicles with Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09575v3)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating realistic and controllable traffic scenes from natural language can greatly enhance the development and evaluation of autonomous driving systems. However, this task poses unique challenges: (1) grounding free-form text into spatially valid and semantically coherent layouts, (2) composing scenarios without predefined locations, and (3) planning multi-agent behaviors and selecting roads that respect agents' configurations. To address these, we propose a modular framework, TTSG, comprising prompt analysis, road retrieval, agent planning, and a novel plan-aware road ranking algorithm to solve these challenges. While large language models (LLMs) are used as general planners, our design integrates them into a tightly controlled pipeline that enforces structure, feasibility, and scene diversity. Notably, our ranking strategy ensures consistency between agent actions and road geometry, enabling scene generation without predefined routes or spawn points. The framework supports both routine and safety-critical scenarios, as well as multi-stage event composition. Experiments on SafeBench demonstrate that our method achieves the lowest average collision rate (3.5\%) across three critical scenarios. Moreover, driving captioning models trained on our generated scenes improve action reasoning by over 30 CIDEr points. These results underscore our proposed framework for flexible, interpretable, and safety-oriented simulation.</p></details> |  |

Widely used datasets, such as Mapillary, often provide only coarse-grained labels - without distinguishing semantically important types such as stop signs or speed limit signs. To this end, we present a new validation set for traffic signs derived from the Mapillary dataset called Mapillary Vistas Validation for Traffic Signs (MVV), where we decompose composite traffic signs into granular, semantically meaningful categories. The dataset includes pixel-level instance masks and has been manually annotated by expert annotators to ensure label fidelity. Further, we benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs against the self-supervised DINOv2 model on this dataset and show that DINOv2 consistently outperforms all VLM baselines-not only on traffic sign recognition, but also on heavily represented categories like vehicles and humans. Our analysis reveals significant limitations in current vision-language models for fine-grained visual understanding and establishes DINOv2 as a strong baseline for dense semantic matching in autonomous driving scenarios. This dataset and evaluation framework pave the way for more reliable, interpretable, and scalable perception systems.

Network traffic classification(ETC) can analyzes attributes such as application categories and malicious intent, supporting network management services like QoS optimization, intrusion detection, and targeted billing. As the prevalence of traffic encryption increases, deep learning models are relied upon for content-agnostic analysis of packet sequences. However, the emergence of new services and attack variants often leads to incremental tasks for ETC models. To ensure model effectiveness, incremental learning techniques are essential; however, recent studies indicate that neural networks experience declining plasticity as tasks increase. We identified plasticity issues in existing incremental learning methods across diverse traffic samples and proposed the PRIME framework. By observing the effective rank of model parameters and the proportion of inactive neurons, the PRIME architecture can appropriately increase the parameter scale when the model's plasticity deteriorates. Experiments show that in multiple encrypted traffic datasets and different category increment scenarios, the PRIME architecture performs significantly better than other incremental learning algorithms with minimal increase in parameter scale.</p></details> |  |

To reduce reliance on handcrafted features and labeled data, recent methods focus on learning generic representations through pre-training on large-scale unlabeled data. However, current pre-trained models face two limitations originating from the adopted Transformer architecture: (1) Limited model efficiency due to the self-attention mechanism with quadratic complexity; (2) Unstable traffic scalability to longer byte sequences, as the explicit positional encodings fail to generalize to input lengths not seen during pre-training. In this paper, we investigate whether convolutions, with linear complexity and implicit positional encoding, are competitive with Transformers in encrypted traffic classification with pre-training. We first conduct a systematic comparison, and observe that convolutions achieve higher efficiency and scalability, with lower classification performance. To address this trade-off, we propose NetConv, a novel pre-trained convolution model for encrypted traffic classification. NetConv employs stacked traffic convolution layers, which enhance the ability to capture localized byte-sequence patterns through window-wise byte scoring and sequence-wise byte gating. We design a continuous byte masking pre-training task to help NetConv learn protocol-specific patterns. Experimental results on four tasks demonstrate that NetConv improves average classification performance by 6.88% and model throughput by 7.41X over existing pre-trained models.</p></details> | Under review |

Many existing approaches adopt an SQL-based paradigm for querying such large-scale video databases; however, this constrains queries to rigid patterns with predefined semantic categories, significantly limiting analytical flexibility. In this work, we explore a language-driven video analytics paradigm aimed at enabling flexible and efficient querying of high-volume video data driven by natural language. Particularly, we build \textsc{Lava}, a system that accepts natural language queries and retrieves traffic targets across multiple levels of granularity and arbitrary categories. \textsc{Lava} comprises three main components: 1) a multi-armed bandit-based efficient sampling method for video segment-level localization; 2) a video-specific open-world detection module for object-level retrieval; and 3) a long-term object trajectory extraction scheme for temporal object association, yielding complete trajectories for object-of-interests. To support comprehensive evaluation, we further develop a novel benchmark by providing diverse, semantically rich natural language predicates and fine-grained annotations for multiple videos. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that \textsc{Lava} improves $F_1$-scores for selection queries by $\mathbf{14\%}$, reduces MPAE for aggregation queries by $\mathbf{0.39}$, and achieves top-$k$ precision of $\mathbf{86\%}$, while processing videos $ \mathbf{9.6\times} $ faster than the most accurate baseline.

It is an important problem in intelligent transportation systems, with a plethora of methods been proposed. Existing efforts mainly focus on capturing and utilizing spatio-temporal dependencies to predict future traffic flows. Though promising, they fall short in adapting to test-time environmental changes of traffic conditions. To tackle this challenge, we propose to introduce large language models (LLMs) to help traffic flow forecasting and design a novel method named Large Language Model Enhanced Traffic Flow Predictor (LEAF). LEAF adopts two branches, capturing different spatio-temporal relations using graph and hypergraph structures respectively. The two branches are first pre-trained individually, and during test-time, they yield different predictions. Based on these predictions, a large language model is used to select the most likely result. Then, a ranking loss is applied as the learning objective to enhance the prediction ability of the two branches. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LEAF.</p></details> | Accepted by ACL 2025 |

Nevertheless, the telecom industry still heavily relies on manual expert intervention. Existing studies have been focused on exhaustively explore the spatial-temporal correlations. However, they often overlook the underlying characteristics of cellular traffic, which are shaped by the sporadic and bursty nature of telecom services. Additionally, concept drift creates substantial obstacles to maintaining satisfactory accuracy in continuous cellular forecasting tasks. To resolve these problems, we put forward an online cellular traffic prediction method grounded in Multi-Grained Spatial-Temporal feature Complementarity (MGSTC). The proposed method is devised to achieve high-precision predictions in practical continuous forecasting scenarios. Concretely, MGSTC segments historical data into chunks and employs the coarse-grained temporal attention to offer a trend reference for the prediction horizon. Subsequently, fine-grained spatial attention is utilized to capture detailed correlations among network elements, which enables localized refinement of the established trend. The complementarity of these multi-grained spatial-temporal features facilitates the efficient transmission of valuable information. To accommodate continuous forecasting needs, we implement an online learning strategy that can detect concept drift in real-time and promptly switch to the appropriate parameter update stage. Experiments carried out on four real-world datasets demonstrate that MGSTC outperforms eleven state-of-the-art baselines consistently.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ACM TKDD. 26 pages, 12 figures,</p></details> |

In reality, internet traffic is non-Markovian, and past states do influence routing performance. Moreover, common deep RL approaches use function approximators, such as neural networks, that do not model the spatial structure in network topologies. To address these shortcomings, we design a network environment with non-Markovian traffic and introduce a spatial-temporal RL (STRL) framework for packet routing. Our approach outperforms traditional baselines by more than 19% during training and 7% for inference despite a change in network topology.</p></details> |  |

Most state-of-the-art (SotA) prediction models primarily focus on forecasting the most likely future. However, for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles, it is equally important to cover the distribution for plausible motion alternatives. To address this, we introduce EP-Diffuser, a novel parameter-efficient diffusion-based generative model designed to capture the distribution of possible traffic scene evolutions. Conditioned on road layout and agent history, our model acts as a predictor and generates diverse, plausible scene continuations. We benchmark EP-Diffuser against two SotA models in terms of accuracy and plausibility of predictions on the Argoverse 2 dataset. Despite its significantly smaller model size, our approach achieves both highly accurate and plausible traffic scene predictions. We further evaluate model generalization ability in an out-of-distribution (OoD) test setting using Waymo Open dataset and show superior robustness of our approach.

Current technologies face two significant challenges: first, the traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution, resulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional convolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution classes; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small targets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract multi-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage framework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. For traffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable vision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to specifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For traffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal Contrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a Vision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL learns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating class confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method achieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for all-class recognition. The model also obtains 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall, significantly outperforming mainstream algorithms and demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization in complex, open-world scenarios.</p></details> | 11pages, 5 figures |

However, existing traffic simulation methods face challenges in their controllability. To address this, we propose a novel diffusion-based and LLM-enhanced traffic simulation framework. Our approach incorporates a high-level understanding module and a low-level refinement module, which systematically examines the hierarchical structure of traffic elements, guides LLMs to thoroughly analyze traffic scenario descriptions step by step, and refines the generation by self-reflection, enhancing their understanding of complex situations. Furthermore, we propose a Frenet-frame-based cost function framework that provides LLMs with geometrically meaningful quantities, improving their grasp of spatial relationships in a scenario and enabling more accurate cost function generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) demonstrate that our method can handle more intricate descriptions and generate a broader range of scenarios in a controllable manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |

Nevertheless, the complete potential of Green Wave systems has yet to be explored. Utilizing emerging technologies and advanced algorithms, such as AI or V2X, would aid in achieving more robust traffic management strategies, especially when integrated with Green Wave. This work comprehensively surveys existing traffic control strategies that enable Green Waves and analyzes their impact on future traffic management systems and urban infrastructure. Understanding previous research on traffic management and its effect on traffic efficiency and safety helps explore the integration of Green Wave solutions with smart city initiatives for effective traffic signal coordination. This paper also discusses the advantages of using Green Wave strategies for emission reduction and considers road safety issues for vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians and cyclists. Finally, the existing challenges and research gaps in building robust and successful Green Wave systems are discussed to articulate explicitly the future requirement of sustainable urban transport.</p></details> |  |

Autonomous driving technologies have emerged as a potential solution. Among traffic control methods, reinforcement learning has shown superior performance over traffic signals in various scenarios. However, prior research has largely focused on small-scale networks or isolated intersections, leaving large-scale mixed traffic control largely unexplored. This study presents the first attempt to use decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning for large-scale mixed traffic control in which some intersections are managed by traffic signals and others by robot vehicles. Evaluating a real-world network in Colorado Springs, CO, USA with 14 intersections, we measure traffic efficiency via average waiting time of vehicles at intersections and the number of vehicles reaching their destinations within a time window (i.e., throughput). At 80% RV penetration rate, our method reduces waiting time from 6.17s to 5.09s and increases throughput from 454 vehicles per 500 seconds to 493 vehicles per 500 seconds, outperforming the baseline of fully signalized intersections. These findings suggest that integrating reinforcement learning-based control large-scale traffic can improve overall efficiency and may inform future urban planning strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2025</p></details> |

However, as System Optimum makes some drivers better off than others, voluntary acceptance seems dubious. To overcome this issue, we propose a new concept of Wardropian cycles, which, in contrast to previous utopian visions, makes the assignment fair on top of being optimal, which amounts to satisfaction of both Wardrop's principles. Such cycles, represented as sequences of permutations to the daily assignment matrices, always exist and equalise, after a limited number of days, average travel times among travellers (like in User Equilibrium) while preserving everyday optimality of path flows (like in System Optimum). We propose exact methods to compute such cycles and reduce their length and within-cycle inconvenience to the users. As identification of optimal cycles turns out to be NP-hard in many aspects, we introduce a greedy heuristic efficiently approximating the optimal solution. Finally, we introduce and discuss a new paradigm of Cyclical User Equilibrium, which ensures stability of optimal Wardropian Cycles under unilateral deviations. We complement our theoretical study with large-scale simulations. In Barcelona, 670 vehicle-hours of Price-of-Anarchy are eliminated using cycles with a median length of 11 days-though 5% of cycles exceed 90 days. However, in Berlin, just five days of applying the greedy assignment rule significantly reduces initial inequity. In Barcelona, Anaheim, and Sioux Falls, less than 7% of the initial inequity remains after 10 days, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach in improving traffic performance with more ubiquitous social acceptability.</p></details> |  |

Recent LiDAR scene flow models utilize the rigid-motion assumption at the instance level, assuming objects are rigid bodies. However, these instance-level methods are not suitable for sparse radar point clouds. In this work, we present a novel Traffic-Aware Radar Scene-Flow (TARS) estimation method, which utilizes motion rigidity at the traffic level. To address the challenges in radar scene flow, we perform object detection and scene flow jointly and boost the latter. We incorporate the feature map from the object detector, trained with detection losses, to make radar scene flow aware of the environment and road users. From this, we construct a Traffic Vector Field (TVF) in the feature space to achieve holistic traffic-level scene understanding in our scene flow branch. When estimating the scene flow, we consider both point-level motion cues from point neighbors and traffic-level consistency of rigid motion within the space. TARS outperforms the state of the art on a proprietary dataset and the View-of-Delft dataset, improving the benchmarks by 23% and 15%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task, which aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using limited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task. This framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the Lane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies and distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained lane traffic states. Based on existing research, we designed several baseline models with the potential to solve the FRTI task and conducted extensive experiments on six datasets representing different road conditions to validate the effectiveness of the RoadDiff model in addressing the FRTI task. The relevant datasets and code are available at https://github.com/ShuhaoLii/RoadDiff.</p></details> |  |

The literature has effectively tackled such a problem, mostly with automated planning techniques leveraging the PDDL+ language and solvers. However, such language has limitations when it comes to specifying optimisation statements and computing optimal plans. In this paper, we provide an alternative solution to the traffic signal optimisation problem based on Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP). We devise an encoding in a CASP language, which is then solved by means of clingcon 3, a system extending the well-known ASP solver clingo. We performed experiments on real historical data from the town of Huddersfield in the UK, comparing our approach to the PDDL+ model that obtained the best results for the considered benchmark. The results showed the potential of our approach for tackling the traffic signal optimisation problem and improving the solution quality of the PDDL+ plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP), Proceedings of ICLP 2025</p></details> |

However, the dynamic traffic flow forecasting is a highly nonlinear problem with complex temporal-spatial dependencies. Although the existing methods has provided great contributions to mine the temporal-spatial patterns in the complex traffic networks, they fail to encode the globally temporal-spatial patterns and are prone to overfit on the pre-defined geographical correlations, and thus hinder the model's robustness on the complex traffic environment. To tackle this issue, in this work, we proposed a multi-grained temporal-spatial graph learning framework to adaptively augment the globally temporal-spatial patterns obtained from a crafted graph transformer encoder with the local patterns from the graph convolution by a crafted gated fusion unit with residual connection techniques. Under these circumstances, our proposed model can mine the hidden global temporal-spatial relations between each monitor stations and balance the relative importance of local and global temporal-spatial patterns. Experiment results demonstrate the strong representation capability of our proposed method and our model consistently outperforms other strong baselines on various real-world traffic networks.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches often hinge on predefined driver models, objective optimization, or reliance on pre-recorded driving datasets, imposing limitations on their scalability, versatility, and adaptability. In this paper, we introduce TrafficMCTS, an innovative framework that harnesses the synergy of group-based Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and Social Value Orientation (SVO) to engender a multifaceted traffic flow with varying driving styles and cooperative tendencies. Anchored by a closed-loop architecture, our framework enables vehicles to dynamically adapt to their environment in real time, and ensure feasible collision-free trajectories. Through comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, we illuminate the advantages of our approach in terms of computational efficiency, planning success rate, intention completion time, and diversity metrics. Besides, we simulate multiple scenarios to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and highlight its ability to induce diverse social behaviors within the traffic flow. Finally, we validate the scalability of TrafficMCTS by demonstrating its capability to efficiently simulate diverse traffic scenarios involving numerous interacting vehicles within a complex road network, capturing the intricate dynamics of human-like driving behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> |

In this paper, we adopt an established formal model of conflict from epistemic game theory to support the development of such agents. We focus on value conflicts-situations in which agents face competing goals rooted in value-laden situations and show how conflict analysis can inform key phases of the design process. This includes value elicitation, capability specification, explanation, and adaptive system refinement. We elaborate and apply the concept of Value-Aligned Operational Design Domains (VODDs) to structure autonomy in accordance with contextual value priorities.

| **[Machine Unlearning of Traffic State Estimation and Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17984v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven traffic state estimation and prediction (TSEP) relies heavily on data sources that contain sensitive information. While the abundance of data has fueled significant breakthroughs, particularly in machine learning-based methods, it also raises concerns regarding privacy, cybersecurity, and data freshness. These issues can erode public trust in intelligent transportation systems. Recently, regulations have introduced the "right to be forgotten", allowing users to request the removal of their private data from models. As machine learning models can remember old data, simply removing it from back-end databases is insufficient in such systems. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel learning paradigm for TSEP-Machine Unlearning TSEP-which enables a trained TSEP model to selectively forget privacy-sensitive, poisoned, or outdated data. By empowering models to "unlearn," we aim to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of data-driven traffic TSEP.</p></details> |  |
| **[LSDM: LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model for Service-Level Mobile Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17795v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Service-level mobile traffic prediction for individual users is essential for network efficiency and quality of service enhancement. However, current prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model (LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions, showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in terms of the coefficient of determination. Compared to models of a similar type, such as CSDI, the root mean squared error can be reduced by at least 8.29%.

Leveraging PPO and WGAN-GP, our model addresses nonlinear interdependencies and training instability inherent in microscopic settings. By explicitly conditioning on surrounding vehicles and road geometry, Ctx2TrajGen generates interaction-aware trajectories aligned with real-world context. Experiments on the drone-captured DRIFT dataset demonstrate superior performance over existing methods in terms of realism, behavioral diversity, and contextual fidelity, offering a robust solution to data scarcity and domain shift without simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-domain Multi-step Thinking: Zero-shot Fine-grained Traffic Sign Recognition in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01534v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we propose Cross-domain Multi-step Thinking (CdMT) to improve zero-shot fine-grained traffic sign recognition (TSR) performance in the wild. Zero-shot fine-grained TSR in the wild is challenging due to the cross-domain problem between clean template traffic signs and real-world counterparts, and existing approaches particularly struggle with cross-country TSR scenarios, where traffic signs typically differ between countries. The proposed CdMT framework tackles these challenges by leveraging the multi-step reasoning capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs). We introduce context, characteristic, and differential descriptions to design multiple thinking processes for LMMs. Context descriptions, which are enhanced by center coordinate prompt optimization, enable the precise localization of target traffic signs in complex road images and filter irrelevant responses via novel prior traffic sign hypotheses. Characteristic descriptions, which are derived from in-context learning with template traffic signs, bridge cross-domain gaps and enhance fine-grained TSR. Differential descriptions refine the multimodal reasoning ability of LMMs by distinguishing subtle differences among similar signs. CdMT is independent of training data and requires only simple and uniform instructions, enabling it to achieve cross-country TSR. We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and two real-world datasets from different countries. The proposed CdMT framework achieved superior performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods on all five datasets, with recognition accuracies of 0.93, 0.89, 0.97, 0.89, and 0.85 on the GTSRB, BTSD, TT-100K, Sapporo, and Yokohama datasets, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published by Knowledge-Based Systems</p></details> |

While existing RL-based methods demonstrate effectiveness in reducing vehicular congestion, their predominant focus on vehicle-centric optimization leaves pedestrian mobility needs and safety challenges unaddressed. In this paper, we present a deep RL framework for adaptive control of eight traffic signals along a real-world urban corridor, jointly optimizing both pedestrian and vehicular efficiency. Our single-agent policy is trained using real-world pedestrian and vehicle demand data derived from Wi-Fi logs and video analysis. The results demonstrate significant performance improvements over traditional fixed-time signals, reducing average wait times per pedestrian and per vehicle by up to 67% and 52% respectively, while simultaneously decreasing total wait times for both groups by up to 67% and 53%. Additionally, our results demonstrate generalization capabilities across varying traffic demands, including conditions entirely unseen during training, validating RL's potential for developing transportation systems that serve all road users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2025</p></details> |

All of them promise astonishing performance in encrypted traffic classification (up to 98% accuracy). In this paper, with a networking expert mindset, we critically reassess their performance. Through extensive analysis, we demonstrate that the reported successes are heavily influenced by data preparation problems, which allow these models to find easy shortcuts - spurious correlation between features and labels - during fine-tuning that unrealistically boost their performance. When such shortcuts are not present - as in real scenarios - these models perform poorly. We also introduce Pcap-Encoder, an LM-based representation learning model that we specifically design to extract features from protocol headers. Pcap-Encoder appears to be the only model that provides an instrumental representation for traffic classification. Yet, its complexity questions its applicability in practical settings. Our findings reveal flaws in dataset preparation and model training, calling for a better and more conscious test design.

To address this growing concern, we introduce Beacon, a naturalistic driving dataset capturing traffic dynamics during blackouts at two major intersections in Memphis, TN, USA. The dataset provides detailed traffic movements, including timesteps, origin, and destination lanes for each vehicle over four hours of peak periods. We analyze traffic demand, vehicle trajectories, and density across different scenarios, demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction under unsignalized, signalized, and mixed traffic conditions. We find that integrating robot vehicles (RVs) into traffic flow can substantially reduce intersection delays, with wait time improvements of up to 82.6%. However, this enhanced traffic efficiency comes with varying environmental impacts, as decreased vehicle idling may lead to higher overall CO2 emissions. To the best of our knowledge, Beacon is the first publicly available traffic dataset for naturalistic driving behaviors during blackouts at intersections.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2025</p></details> |

This study explores how robot vehicles (RVs) can enhance heterogeneous traffic flow, particularly at unsignalized intersections where traditional methods fail during power outages. Using reinforcement learning (RL) and real-world data, we simulate mixed traffic at complex intersections with RV penetration rates ranging from 10% to 90%. Results show that average waiting times drop by up to 86% and 91% compared to signalized and unsignalized intersections, respectively. We observe a "rarity advantage," where less frequent vehicles benefit the most (up to 87%). Although CO2 emissions and fuel consumption increase with RV penetration, they remain well below those of traditional signalized traffic. Decreased space headways also indicate more efficient road usage. These findings highlight RVs' potential to improve traffic efficiency and reduce environmental impact in complex, heterogeneous settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2025</p></details> |

This study addresses binary VPN detection, distinguishing VPN-encrypted from non-VPN traffic using wavelet transform-based features across multiple machine learning models. Unlike previous studies focused on application-level classification within encrypted traffic, we specifically evaluate the fundamental task of VPN identification regardless of application type. We analyze the impact of wavelet decomposition levels and dataset filtering on classification performance across significantly imbalanced data, where filtering reduces some traffic categories by up to 95%. Our results demonstrate that Random Forest (RF) achieves superior performance with an F1-score of 99%, maintaining robust accuracy even after significant dataset filtering. Neural Networks (NN) show comparable effectiveness with an F1-score of 98% when trained on wavelet level 12, while Support Vector Machines (SVM) exhibit notable sensitivity to dataset reduction, with F1-scores dropping from 90% to 85% after filtering. Comparing wavelet decomposition at levels 5 and 12, we observe improved classification performance at level 12, particularly for variable traffic types, though the marginal gains may not justify the additional computational overhead. These findings establish RF as the most reliable model for VPN traffic classification while highlighting key performance tradeoffs in feature extraction and preprocessing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at SoftCOM 2025</p></details> |

Given that ST data comprises non-stationary and complex temporal patterns, interpreting and predicting such trends is inherently challenging. Representing ST data in decomposed modes helps infer underlying behavior and assess the impact of noise on predictive performance. We propose a framework that decomposes ST data into interpretable modes using variational mode decomposition (VMD) and processes them through a neural network for future state forecasting. Unlike existing graph-based traffic forecasters that operate directly on raw or aggregated time series, the proposed hybrid approach, termed the Variational Mode Graph Convolutional Network (VMGCN), first decomposes non-stationary signals into interpretable variational modes by determining the optimal mode count via reconstruction-loss minimization and then learns both intramode and cross-mode spatiotemporal dependencies through a novel attention-augmented GCN. Additionally, we analyze the significance of each mode and the effect of bandwidth constraints on multi-horizon traffic flow predictions. The proposed two-stage design yields significant accuracy gains while providing frequency-level interpretability with demonstrated superior performance on the LargeST dataset for both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers an adaptive method for TSC by responding to dynamic traffic patterns, with multi-agent RL (MARL) gaining traction as intersections naturally function as coordinated agents. However, due to shifts in environmental dynamics, implementing MARL-based TSC policies in the real world often leads to a significant performance drop, known as the sim-to-real gap. Grounded Action Transformation (GAT) has successfully mitigated this gap in single-agent RL for TSC, but real-world traffic networks, which involve numerous interacting intersections, are better suited to a MARL framework. In this work, we introduce JL-GAT, an application of GAT to MARL-based TSC that balances scalability with enhanced grounding capability by incorporating information from neighboring agents. JL-GAT adopts a decentralized approach to GAT, allowing for the scalability often required in real-world traffic networks while still capturing key interactions between agents. Comprehensive experiments on various road networks under simulated adverse weather conditions, along with ablation studies, demonstrate the effectiveness of JL-GAT.

With the cellular traffic demand increasing so dramatically, it is now necessary to accurately predict the user traffic in cellular networks, so as to improve the performance in terms of resource allocation and utilisation. Since traffic learning and prediction is a classical and appealing field, which still yields many meaningful results, there has been an increasing interest in leveraging Machine Learning tools to analyse the total traffic served in a given region, to optimise the operation of the network. With the help of this project, we seek to exploit the traffic history by using it to predict the nature and occurrence of future traffic. Furthermore, we classify the traffic into particular application types, to increase our understanding of the nature of the traffic. By leveraging the power of machine learning and identifying its usefulness in the field of cellular networks we try to achieve three main objectives - classification of the application generating the traffic, prediction of packet arrival intensity and burst occurrence. The design of the prediction and classification system is done using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model. The LSTM predictor developed in this experiment would return the number of uplink packets and also estimate the probability of burst occurrence in the specified future time interval. For the purpose of classification, the regression layer in our LSTM prediction model is replaced by a softmax classifier which is used to classify the application generating the cellular traffic into one of the four applications including surfing, video calling, voice calling, and video streaming.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |

Recent empirical approaches for analyzing traffic patterns have gained traction due to their applicability to city-scale policy development. However, conventional methodologies often rely on fragmented grid-based techniques, which may overlook critical interdependencies among spatial elements and temporal continuity. These limitations can compromise analytical effectiveness in complex urban environments. To address these challenges, we propose PriorMotion, a data integration framework designed to systematically uncover movement patterns through driving dynamics analysis. Our approach combines multi-scale empirical observations with customized analytical tools to capture evolving spatial-temporal trends in urban traffic. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PriorMotion significantly enhances analytical outcomes, including increased accuracy in traffic pattern analysis, improved adaptability to heterogeneous data environments, and reduced long-term projection errors. Validation confirms its effectiveness for urban infrastructure management applications requiring precise characterization of complex spatial-temporal interactions.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

This paper proposes Fourier Domain Adaptation (FDA), which requires only training data modifications without architectural changes, enabling effective adaptation to rainy and foggy conditions. FDA minimizes the domain gap between source and target domains, creating a dataset for reliable performance under adverse weather. The source domain merged LISA and S2TLD datasets, processed to address class imbalance. Established methods simulated rainy and foggy scenarios to form the target domain. Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) techniques were explored to leverage data more effectively, addressing the shortage of comprehensive datasets and poor performance of state-of-the-art models under hostile weather. Experimental results show FDA-augmented models outperform baseline models across mAP50, mAP50-95, Precision, and Recall metrics. YOLOv8 achieved a 12.25% average increase across all metrics.

| **[DHLight: Multi-agent Policy-based Directed Hypergraph Learning for Traffic Signal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05037v2)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated notable promise in the realm of intelligent traffic signal control, facilitating the coordination across multiple intersections. However, the traditional methods rely on standard graph structures often fail to capture the intricate higher-order spatio-temporal correlations inherent in real-world traffic dynamics. Standard graphs cannot fully represent the spatial relationships within road networks, which limits the effectiveness of graph-based approaches. In contrast, directed hypergraphs provide more accurate representation of spatial information to model complex directed relationships among multiple nodes. In this paper, we propose DHLight, a novel multi-agent policy-based framework that synergistically integrates directed hypergraph learning module. This framework introduces a novel dynamic directed hypergraph construction mechanism, which captures complex and evolving spatio-temporal relationships among intersections in road networks. By leveraging the directed hypergraph relational structure, DHLight empowers agents to achieve adaptive decision-making in traffic signal control. The effectiveness of DHLight is validated against state-of-the-art baselines through extensive experiments in various network datasets. We release the code to support the reproducibility of this work at https://github.com/LuckyVoasem/Traffic-Light-control</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[AGENTS-LLM: Augmentative GENeration of Challenging Traffic Scenarios with an Agentic LLM Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13729v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rare, yet critical, scenarios pose a significant challenge in testing and evaluating autonomous driving planners. Relying solely on real-world driving scenes requires collecting massive datasets to capture these scenarios. While automatic generation of traffic scenarios appears promising, data-driven models require extensive training data and often lack fine-grained control over the output. Moreover, generating novel scenarios from scratch can introduce a distributional shift from the original training scenes which undermines the validity of evaluations especially for learning-based planners. To sidestep this, recent work proposes to generate challenging scenarios by augmenting original scenarios from the test set. However, this involves the manual augmentation of scenarios by domain experts. An approach that is unable to meet the demands for scale in the evaluation of self-driving systems. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel LLM-agent based framework for augmenting real-world traffic scenarios using natural language descriptions, addressing the limitations of existing methods. A key innovation is the use of an agentic design, enabling fine-grained control over the output and maintaining high performance even with smaller, cost-effective LLMs. Extensive human expert evaluation demonstrates our framework's ability to accurately adhere to user intent, generating high quality augmented scenarios comparable to those created manually.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional AI approaches often fail to capture the intricate spatial and temporal patterns that exist, due to e.g., the mobility of users. We introduce a lightweight, dual-path Spatiotemporal Network that leverages a Scalar LSTM (sLSTM) for efficient temporal modeling and a three-layer Conv3D module for spatial feature extraction. A fusion layer integrates both streams into a cohesive representation, enabling robust forecasting. Our design improves gradient stability and convergence speed while reducing prediction error. Evaluations on real-world datasets show superior forecast performance over ConvLSTM baselines and strong generalization to unseen regions, making it well-suited for large-scale, next-generation network deployments. Experimental evaluation shows a 23% MAE reduction over ConvLSTM, with a 30% improvement in model generalization.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we propose GraphTrafficGPT, a novel graph-based architecture, which fundamentally redesigns the task coordination process for LLM-driven traffic applications. GraphTrafficGPT represents tasks and their dependencies as nodes and edges in a directed graph, enabling efficient parallel execution and dynamic resource allocation. The main idea behind the proposed model is a Brain Agent that decomposes user queries, constructs optimized dependency graphs, and coordinates a network of specialized agents for data retrieval, analysis, visualization, and simulation. By introducing advanced context-aware token management and supporting concurrent multi-query processing, the proposed architecture handles interdependent tasks typical of modern urban mobility environments. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphTrafficGPT reduces token consumption by 50.2% and average response latency by 19.0% compared to TrafficGPT, while supporting simultaneous multi-query execution with up to 23.0% improvement in efficiency.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces an interpretable Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework to address this gap. Our attention-based model predicts the number of upcoming clearances, the instructions issued to aircraft by ATCOs, from interactions within static traffic scenarios. Crucially, we derive an interpretable, per-aircraft task demand score by systematically ablating aircraft and measuring the impact on the model's predictions. Our framework significantly outperforms an ATCO-inspired heuristic and is a more reliable estimator of scenario complexity than established baselines. The resulting tool can attribute task demand to specific aircraft, offering a new way to analyse and understand the drivers of complexity for applications in controller training and airspace redesign.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Author Accepted Manuscript version of paper at the AIAA AVIATION Forum 2025</p></details> |

The research utilized 30-second interval traffic data from California Highway 78 over a five-month period from July to November 2022, analyzing a 7.24 km westbound section connecting "Melrose Dr" and "El-Camino Real" in the San Diego area. The study employed Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms, analyzing data collection intervals ranging from 30 seconds to 15 minutes. Using R^2, MAE, and RMSE as performance metrics, the analysis revealed that both MLR and RF models performed optimally with 10-minute data collection intervals. These findings are expected to contribute to future traffic congestion solutions and efficient traffic management.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, methods such as manual counting, loop detectors, pneumatic road tubes, and camera-based recognition have been used for TMC estimation. Although generally reliable, camera-based TMC estimation is prone to inaccuracies under poor lighting conditions during harsh weather and nighttime. In contrast, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology is gaining popularity in recent times due to reduced costs and its expanding use in 3D object detection, tracking, and related applications. This paper presents the authors' endeavor to develop, deploy and evaluate a dual-LiDAR system at an intersection in the city of Rialto, California, for TMC estimation. The 3D bounding box detections from the two LiDARs are used to classify vehicle counts based on traffic directions, vehicle movements, and vehicle classes. This work discusses the estimated TMC results and provides insights into the observed trends and irregularities. Potential improvements are also discussed that could enhance not only TMC estimation, but also trajectory forecasting and intent prediction at intersections.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 Pag...</summary><p>7 Pages, 8 Figures.

Apart from variation across different content types, e.g., game genres, we discovered time-variability within a clip from second to second, and explored the ramifications for traffic management. We introduced utility as an elegant way to manage resource sharing preferences. Our analysis of resource sharing methods shows that frequent QoE-aware reallocation has significant performance advantages compared to static rate allocation, even in case the latter is based on rich information about long-term average spatial complexity. We have also shown that utility-based resource allocation has clear advantages over methods targeting equal QoE allocation, it increases the average QoE, while it still controls the worst case QoE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time series classification of satellite data using LSTM networks: an approach for predicting leaf-fall to minimize railroad traffic disruption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11702v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Railroad traffic disruption as a result of leaf-fall cost the UK rail industry over 300 million per year and measures to mitigate such disruptions are employed on a large scale, with 1.67 million kilometers of track being treated in the UK in 2021 alone. Therefore, the ability to anticipate the timing of leaf-fall would offer substantial benefits for rail network operators, enabling the efficient scheduling of such mitigation measures. However, current methodologies for predicting leaf-fall exhibit considerable limitations in terms of scalability and reliability. This study endeavors to devise a prediction system that leverages specialized prediction methods and the latest satellite data sources to generate both scalable and reliable insights into leaf-fall timings. An LSTM network trained on ground-truth leaf-falling data combined with multispectral and meteorological satellite data demonstrated a root-mean-square error of 6.32 days for predicting the start of leaf-fall and 9.31 days for predicting the end of leaf-fall. The model, which improves upon previous work on the topic, offers promising opportunities for the optimization of leaf mitigation measures in the railway industry and the improvement of our understanding of complex ecological systems.</p></details> |  |

Currently, a cooperative control strategy based on connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is a fundamental solution to this problem. While CAVs are not fully widespread, it is necessary to propose a hierarchical cooperative on-ramp merging control (HCOMC) framework for heterogeneous traffic flow on two-lane highways to address this gap. This paper extends longitudinal car-following models based on the intelligent driver model and lateral lane-changing models using the quintic polynomial curve to account for human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs, comprehensively considering human factors and cooperative adaptive cruise control. Besides, this paper proposes a HCOMC framework, consisting of a hierarchical cooperative planning model based on the modified virtual vehicle model, a discretionary lane-changing model based on game theory, and a multi-objective optimization model using the elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to ensure the safe, smooth, and efficient merging process. Then, the performance of our HCOMC is analyzed under different traffic densities and CAV penetration rates through simulation. The findings underscore our HCOMC's pronounced comprehensive advantages in enhancing the safety of group vehicles, stabilizing and expediting merging process, optimizing traffic efficiency, and economizing fuel consumption compared with benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, accepted for IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC) 2025</p></details> |

Existing acceleration strategies, which rely on commercial solvers or deep learning, face scalability issues and struggle with degrading performance or long computational time. Unlike existing algorithms adopting parallel strategies, we propose Sequential Source-Destination Optimization (SSDO), a sequential solver-free algorithm for TE. SSDO decomposes the problem into subproblems, each focused on adjusting the split ratios for a specific source-destination (SD) demand while keeping others fixed. To enhance the efficiency of subproblem optimization, we design a Balanced Binary Search Method (BBSM), which identifies the most balanced split ratios among multiple solutions that minimize Maximum Link Utilization (MLU). SSDO dynamically updates the sequence of SDs based on real-time utilization, which accelerates convergence and enhances solution quality. We evaluate SSDO on Meta DCNs and two wide-area networks. In a Meta topology, SSDO achieves a 65\% and 60\% reduction in normalized MLU compared to TEAL and POP, two state-of-the-art TE acceleration methods, while delivering a $12\times$ speedup over POP. These results demonstrate the superior performance of SSDO in large-scale TE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 23rd USENIX Symposium on Network Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI '26), to be held in Seattle on May 4-6, 2026</p></details> |

The models particularly are based on GraphSAGE, Bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) as well as Multi-Head Attention, together with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BI-LSTM) Multi-Head Attention and BI-LSTM and LSTM models. The chosen models demonstrated great performance to model temporal patterns and detect feature significance. The observed performance are mainly due to the fact that IoT system traffic patterns are both sequential and diverse, leaving a rich set of temporal patterns for the models to learn. Experimental results showed that BERT maintained the best performance. It achieved 99.94% accuracy rate alongside high precision and recall, F1-score and AUC-ROC score of 99.99% which demonstrates its capabilities through temporal dependency capture. The Multi-Head Attention offered promising results by providing good detection capabilities with interpretable results. On the other side, the Multi-Head Attention model required significant processing time like BI-LSTM variants. The GraphSAGE model achieved good accuracy while requiring the shortest training time but yielded the lowest accuracy, precision, and F1 score compared to the other models</p></details> |  |

| **[TGLD: A Trust-Aware Game-Theoretic Lane-Changing Decision Framework for Automated Vehicles in Heterogeneous Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10075v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated vehicles (AVs) face a critical need to adopt socially compatible behaviors and cooperate effectively with human-driven vehicles (HVs) in heterogeneous traffic environment. However, most existing lane-changing frameworks overlook HVs' dynamic trust levels, limiting their ability to accurately predict human driver behaviors. To address this gap, this study proposes a trust-aware game-theoretic lane-changing decision (TGLD) framework. First, we formulate a multi-vehicle coalition game, incorporating fully cooperative interactions among AVs and partially cooperative behaviors from HVs informed by real-time trust evaluations. Second, we develop an online trust evaluation method to dynamically estimate HVs' trust levels during lane-changing interactions, guiding AVs to select context-appropriate cooperative maneuvers. Lastly, social compatibility objectives are considered by minimizing disruption to surrounding vehicles and enhancing the predictability of AV behaviors, thereby ensuring human-friendly and context-adaptive lane-changing strategies. A human-in-the-loop experiment conducted in a highway on-ramp merging scenario validates our TGLD approach. Results show that AVs can effectively adjust strategies according to different HVs' trust levels and driving styles. Moreover, incorporating a trust mechanism significantly improves lane-changing efficiency, maintains safety, and contributes to transparent and adaptive AV-HV interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures, accepted for IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Traffic Signal Phase and Timing Estimation with Large-Scale Floating Car Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14190v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective modern transportation systems depend critically on accurate Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) estimation. However, acquiring ground-truth SPaT information faces significant hurdles due to communication challenges with transportation departments and signal installers. As a result, Floating Car Data (FCD) has become the primary source for large-scale SPaT analyses. Current FCD approaches often simplify the problem by assuming fixed schedules and basic intersection designs for specific times and locations. These methods fail to account for periodic signal changes, diverse intersection structures, and the inherent limitations of real-world data, thus lacking a comprehensive framework that is universally applicable. Addressing this limitation, we propose an industrial-grade FCD analysis suite that manages the entire process, from initial data preprocessing to final SPaT estimation. Our approach estimates signal phases, identifies time-of-day (TOD) periods, and determines the durations of red and green lights. The framework's notable stability and robustness across diverse conditions, regardless of road geometry, is a key feature. Furthermore, we provide a cleaned, de-identified FCD dataset and supporting parameters to facilitate future research. Currently operational within our navigation platform, the system analyses over 15 million FCD records daily, supporting over two million traffic signals in mainland China, with more than 75\% of estimations demonstrating less than five seconds of error.</p></details> | Accepted by ITSC'25 |

Each region or road segment can be viewed as an individual client that measures local traffic flow, making Federated Learning (FL) a suitable approach for collaboratively training models without sharing raw data. In centralized FL, a central server collects and aggregates model updates from multiple clients to build a shared model while preserving each client's data privacy. Standard FL methods, such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg), assume that clients are independent, which can limit performance in traffic prediction tasks where spatial relationships between clients are important. Federated Graph Learning methods can capture these dependencies during server-side aggregation, but they often introduce significant computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a lightweight graph-aware FL approach that blends the simplicity of FedAvg with key ideas from graph learning. Rather than training full models, our method applies basic neighbourhood aggregation principles to guide parameter updates, weighting client models based on graph connectivity. This approach captures spatial relationships effectively while remaining computationally efficient. We evaluate our method on two benchmark traffic datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, and show that it achieves competitive performance compared to standard baselines and recent graph-based federated learning techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at FedKDD 2025: International Joint Workshop on Federated Learning for Data Mining and Graph Analytics. 6 pages, 1 figure</p></details> |

Although not only accuracy but also efficiency for scalability is important, some previous methods struggle to capture heterogeneity such as varying traffic patterns across regions and time periods. Moreover, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are the mainstream of traffic prediction, not only require predefined adjacency matrix, but also limit scalability to large-scale data containing many nodes due to their inherent complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose Deformable Dynamic Convolution Network (DDCN) for accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. Traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are limited in modeling non-Euclidean spatial structures and spatio-temporal heterogeneity, DDCN overcomes these challenges by dynamically applying deformable filters based on offset. Specifically, DDCN decomposes transformer-style CNN to encoder-decoder structure, and applies proposed approaches to the spatial and spatio-temporal attention blocks of the encoder to emphasize important features. The decoder, composed of feed-forward module, complements the output of the encoder. This novel structure make DDCN can perform accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. In comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets, DDCN achieves competitive performance, emphasizing the potential and effectiveness of CNN-based approaches for spatio-temporal traffic prediction.</p></details> | 7 pages |

Traffic planning experts rely on specialized platforms to simulate traffic systems, assessing the efficacy of the road network across various states of modifications. Nevertheless, a prevailing issue persists: many existing traffic planning platforms exhibit inefficiencies in flexibly interacting with the road network's structure and attributes and intuitively comparing multiple states during the iterative planning process. This paper introduces TraSculptor, an interactive planning decision-making system. To develop TraSculptor, we identify and address two challenges: interactive modification of road networks and intuitive comparison of multiple network states. For the first challenge, we establish flexible interactions to enable experts to easily and directly modify the road network on the map. For the second challenge, we design a comparison view with a history tree of multiple states and a road-state matrix to facilitate intuitive comparison of road network states. To evaluate TraSculptor, we provided a usage scenario where the Braess's paradox was showcased, invited experts to perform a case study on the Sioux Falls network, and collected expert feedback through interviews.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics</p></details> |

Recent findings in visual perception suggest that foundation models, enabled by advanced pre-training, allow simple yet flexible architectures to outperform specialized designs. Therefore, in this work, we investigate an architecturally simple encoder-only approach using plain Video Vision Transformers (Video ViTs) and study how pre-training enables strong TAD performance. We find that: (i) strong pre-training enables simple encoder-only models to match or even surpass the performance of specialized state-of-the-art TAD methods, while also being significantly more efficient; (ii) although weakly- and fully-supervised pre-training are advantageous on standard benchmarks, we find them less effective for TAD. Instead, self-supervised Masked Video Modeling (MVM) provides the strongest signal; and (iii) Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT) on unlabeled driving videos further improves downstream performance, without requiring anomalous examples. Our findings highlight the importance of pre-training and show that effective, efficient, and scalable TAD models can be built with minimal architectural complexity.

The SUs can reshape their traffic demands by modifying the semantic extraction factor, while the RIS can reconfigure the channel conditions via the passive beamforming. This provides the AP with greater flexibility to decode the superimposed signals from the SUs. We aim to minimize the system's overall energy consumption, while ensuring that each SU's traffic demand is satisfied. Hence, we formulate a joint optimization problem of the SUs' decoding order and semantic control, as well as the RIS's passive beamforming strategy. This problem is intractable due to the complicated coupling in constraints. To solve this, we decompose the original problem into two subproblems and solve them by using a series of approximate methods. Numerical results show that the joint traffic reshaping and channel reconfiguration scheme significantly improves the energy saving performance of the NOMA transmissions compared to the benchmark methods.</p></details> |  |

We use the Spatiotemporal Generative Adversarial Network (STGAN) framework combining Graph Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks to capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies in traffic data. We apply STGAN to real-time, minute-by-minute observations from 42 traffic cameras across Gothenburg, Sweden, collected over several months in 2020. The images are processed to compute a flow metric representing vehicle density, which serves as input for the model. Training is conducted on data from April to November 2020, and validation is performed on a separate dataset from November 14 to 23, 2020. Our results demonstrate that the model effectively detects traffic anomalies with high precision and low false positive rates. The detected anomalies include camera signal interruptions, visual artifacts, and extreme weather conditions affecting traffic flow.</p></details> |  |

This can induce stress. Detecting stress is a key point in maintaining the high safety standards of ATC. However, processing ATC voice data entails privacy restrictions, e.g. the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) law. Anonymizing the ATC voice data is one way to comply with these restrictions. In this paper, different architectures for stress detection for anonymized ATCO speech are evaluated. Our best networks reach a stress detection accuracy of 93.6% on an anonymized version of the Speech Under Simulated and Actual Stress (SUSAS) dataset and an accuracy of 80.1% on our anonymized ATC simulation dataset. This shows that privacy does not have to be an impediment in building well-performing deep-learning-based models.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables, publication identification number (URN)- urn:nbn:de:101:1-2022122008393409239462, see archived online publication- https://d-nb.info/127614606X/34 & Katalogeintrag: https://d-nb.info/127614606X/</p></details> |

The uniqueness and existence of the entropy solution are proven via doubling of the variables arguments and convergent finite volume approximations, respectively. The primary goal is to establish that the finite volume numerical approximations of the system converge to the unique entropy solution at a rate of $\sqrt{\Delta t}$, even when using relatively less regular one-sided kernels, compared to the globally smooth kernels analyzed in [Num. Math., 156(1):237-271, 2024] and [IMA J. Numer. Anal., 44(6):3354-3392, 2024]. The applicability of the proven theory to a general class of systems of nonlocal balance laws coupled strongly through the convective part and weakly through the source part, is indicated. As the support of the kernel tends to zero, the convergence of the entropy solutions of the proposed model to its local counterparts [SIAM J. Math. Anal., 51: 3694--3713, 2019] is also discussed. Numerical simulations illustrating the behavior of the entropy solutions of the coupled nonlocal systems are also shown.</p></details> |  |

Traffic sign recognition, an essential component of autonomous vehicles, is particularly vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can compromise driving safety. In this paper, we propose an N-version machine learning (NVML) framework that integrates a safety-aware weighted soft voting mechanism. Our approach utilizes Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to assess potential safety risks and assign dynamic, safety-aware weights to the ensemble outputs. We evaluate the robustness of three-version NVML systems employing various voting mechanisms against adversarial samples generated using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that our NVML approach significantly enhances the robustness and safety of traffic sign recognition systems under adversarial conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages including appendix, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization for Traffic Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15079v3)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern intelligent transportation systems rely on accurate spatiotemporal traffic analysis to optimize urban mobility and infrastructure resilience. However, pervasive missing data caused by sensor failures and heterogeneous sensing gaps fundamentally hinders reliable traffic modeling. This paper proposes a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model that synergizes low-rank tensor algebra with deep representation learning for robust traffic data imputation. The model innovatively embeds CP decomposition into neural architecture through learnable embedding projections, where sparse traffic tensors are encoded into dense latent factors across road segments, time intervals, and mobility metrics. A hierarchical feature fusion mechanism employs Hadamard products to explicitly model multilinear interactions, while stacked multilayer perceptron layers nonlinearly refine these representations to capture complex spatiotemporal couplings. Extensive evaluations on six urban traffic datasets demonstrate NCPF's superiority over six state-of-the-art baselines. By unifying CP decomposition's interpretable factor analysis with neural network's nonlinear expressive power, NCPF provides a principled yet flexible approaches for high-dimensional traffic data imputation, offering critical support for next-generation transportation digital twins and adaptive traffic control systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing state-of-the-art solutions often fail to meet the required level of protection against linkage attacks and demographic biases, leading to privacy leakage and inequity in data analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm designed to address the challenges regarding the balance of privacy, utility, and fairness in location-based vehicular traffic management systems. In this context, utility means providing reliable and meaningful traffic information, while fairness ensures that all regions and individuals are treated equitably in data use and decision-making. Employing differential privacy techniques, we enhance data security by integrating query-based data access with iterative shuffling and calibrated noise injection, ensuring that sensitive geographical data remains protected. We ensure adherence to epsilon-differential privacy standards by implementing the Laplace mechanism. We implemented our algorithm on vehicular location-based data from Norway, demonstrating its ability to maintain data utility for traffic management and urban planning while ensuring fair representation of all geographical areas without being overrepresented or underrepresented. Additionally, we have created a heatmap of Norway based on our model, illustrating the privatized and fair representation of the traffic conditions across various cities. Our algorithm provides privacy in vehicular traffic</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted in VTC 2025 Spring, Oslo, Norway</p></details> |

Without relying on simulation, we derive a series of coupled delay differential equations to model vehicular interactions. By introducing a mnemonic-based symbolic system, we establish a mathematical framework incorporating stochastic initial conditions, non-uniform reaction times, and cognitive lag. A full linear stability analysis is conducted using Fourier decomposition and modal perturbation techniques. Our results identify critical thresholds for harmonic induction, delineate the bounds of safe following distances, and reveal hysteresis in driver overcorrection. The analysis concludes with implications for autonomous vehicle control and potential suppression strategies for oscillatory instability. All derivations are purely symbolic and analytically proven.</p></details> | 79 pages |

The state-of-the-art for predicting missing links in the hard case of a network without node attributes uses model stacking or neural network techniques. It remains unknown which approach is best, and whether or how the best choice of algorithm depends on the input network's characteristics. We answer these questions systematically using a large, structurally diverse benchmark of 550 real-world networks under two standard accuracy measures (AUC and Top-k), comparing four stacking algorithms with 42 topological link predictors, two of which we introduce here, and two graph neural network algorithms. We show that no algorithm is best across all input networks, all algorithms perform well on most social networks, and few perform well on economic and biological networks. Overall, model stacking with a random forest is both highly scalable and surpasses on AUC or is competitive with graph neural networks on Top-k accuracy. But, algorithm performance depends strongly on network characteristics like the degree distribution, triangle density, and degree assortativity. We introduce a meta-learning algorithm that exploits this variability to optimize link predictions for individual networks by selecting the best algorithm to apply, which we show outperforms all state-of-the-art algorithms and scales to large networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables, 7 appendices</p></details> |

However, their widespread adoption and growing financial significance have attracted persistent and sophisticated threats, such as phishing campaigns and contract-level exploits. Traditional transaction-based threat detection methods often expose sensitive user data and interactions, raising privacy and security concerns. In response, static bytecode analysis has emerged as a proactive mitigation strategy, identifying malicious contracts before they execute harmful actions. Building on this approach, we introduced PhishingHook, the first machine-learning-based framework for detecting phishing activities in smart contracts via static bytecode and opcode analysis, achieving approximately 90% detection accuracy. Nevertheless, two pressing challenges remain: (1) the increasing use of sophisticated bytecode obfuscation techniques designed to evade static analysis, and (2) the heterogeneity of blockchain environments requiring platform-agnostic solutions. This paper presents a vision for ScamDetect (Smart Contract Agnostic Malware Detector), a robust, modular, and platform-agnostic framework for smart contract malware detection. Over the next 2.5 years, ScamDetect will evolve in two stages: first, by tackling obfuscated Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode through graph neural network (GNN) analysis of control flow graphs (CFGs), leveraging GNNs' ability to capture complex structural patterns beyond opcode sequences; and second, by generalizing detection capabilities to emerging runtimes such as WASM. ScamDetect aims to enable proactive, scalable security for the future of decentralized ecosystems.</p></details> |  |

However, obtaining such factors is challenging in practice: additional and valid information sources are inherently scarce, and even when such sources are available, their independence from the original source cannot be guaranteed. To address this challenge, In this paper we propose a Differentiated Factor Consistency Semi-supervised Framework (DiFac), which derives differentiated factors from a single information source and enforces their consistency. During pre-training, the model learns to extract these factors; in training, it iteratively removes samples with conflicting factors and ranks pseudo-labels based on the shortest stave principle, selecting the top candidate samples to reduce overconfidence commonly observed in confidence-based or ensemble-based methods. Our framework can also incorporate additional information sources. In this work, we leverage the large multimodal language model to introduce latent textual knowledge as auxiliary decision factors, and we design a accountability scoring mechanism to mitigate additional erroneous judgments introduced by these auxiliary factors. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that DiFac consistently improves robustness and generalization in low-label regimes, outperforming other baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

The iterative hybrid mechanism integrates the proposed Node-Destroyer Model, a machine learning hybrid model that utilized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) such identifies and selects customer nodes to guide the Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) operator within the metaheuristic optimization frameworks. This model leverages the structural properties of the problem and solution that can be represented as a graph, to guide strategic selections concerning node removal. The proposed approach reduces operational complexity and scales down the search space involved in the optimization process. The hybrid approach is applied specifically to the CVRP and does not require retraining across problem instances of different sizes. The proposed hybrid mechanism is able to improve the performance of baseline metaheuristic algorithms. Our approach not only enhances the solution quality for standard CVRP benchmarks but also proves scalability on very large-scale instances with up to 30,000 customer nodes. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets show that the proposed hybrid mechanism is capable of improving different baseline algorithms, achieving better quality of solutions under similar settings.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |

Molecular representation methods, including fingerprints and graph neural networks (GNNs), achieve state-of-the-art results by effectively deriving features from molecular structures. However, these methods often overlook decades of accumulated semantic and contextual knowledge. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning abilities and prior knowledge across scientific domains, leading us to hypothesize that LLMs can generate rich molecular representations when guided to reason in multiple perspectives. To address these gaps, we propose $\text{M}^{2}$LLM, a multi-view framework that integrates three perspectives: the molecular structure view, the molecular task view, and the molecular rules view. These views are fused dynamically to adapt to task requirements, and experiments demonstrate that $\text{M}^{2}$LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks across classification and regression tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that representation derived from LLM achieves exceptional performance by leveraging two core functionalities: the generation of molecular embeddings through their encoding capabilities and the curation of molecular features through advanced reasoning processes.</p></details> | IJCAI 2025 |
| **[Combat Urban Congestion via Collaboration: Heterogeneous GNN-based MARL for Coordinated Platooning and Traffic Signal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10948v3)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the years, reinforcement learning has emerged as a popular approach to develop signal control and vehicle platooning strategies either independently or in a hierarchical way. However, jointly controlling both in real-time to alleviate traffic congestion presents new challenges, such as the inherent physical and behavioral heterogeneity between signal control and platooning, as well as coordination between them. This paper proposes an innovative solution to tackle these challenges based on heterogeneous graph multi-agent reinforcement learning and traffic theories. Our approach involves: 1) designing platoon and signal control as distinct reinforcement learning agents with their own set of observations, actions, and reward functions to optimize traffic flow; 2) designing coordination by incorporating graph neural networks within multi-agent reinforcement learning to facilitate seamless information exchange among agents on a regional scale; 3) applying alternating optimization for training, allowing agents to update their own policies and adapt to other agents' policies. We evaluate our approach through SUMO simulations, which show convergent results in terms of both travel time and fuel consumption, and superior performance compared to other adaptive signal control methods.</p></details> |  |

These models are trained on fleet movement data, including robot positions, goals, and interactions, from hundreds of thousands of robots in Amazon warehouses worldwide. DeepFleet consists of four architectures that each embody a distinct inductive bias and collectively explore key points in the design space for multi-agent foundation models: the robot-centric (RC) model is an autoregressive decision transformer operating on neighborhoods of individual robots; the robot-floor (RF) model uses a transformer with cross-attention between robots and the warehouse floor; the image-floor (IF) model applies convolutional encoding to a multi-channel image representation of the full fleet; and the graph-floor (GF) model combines temporal attention with graph neural networks for spatial relationships. In this paper, we describe these models and present our evaluation of the impact of these design choices on prediction task performance. We find that the robot-centric and graph-floor models, which both use asynchronous robot state updates and incorporate the localized structure of robot interactions, show the most promise. We also present experiments that show that these two models can make effective use of larger warehouses operation datasets as the models are scaled up.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[UQGNN: Uncertainty Quantification of Graph Neural Networks for Multivariate Spatiotemporal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08551v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal prediction plays a critical role in numerous real-world applications such as urban planning, transportation optimization, disaster response, and pandemic control. In recent years, researchers have made significant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for spatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic, i.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty, leading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies have introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically focus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes), thereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban phenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network with Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal prediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware Spatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph convolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network to effectively capture complex spatial and temporal interaction patterns, and (ii) a multivariate probabilistic prediction module designed to estimate both expected mean values and associated uncertainties. Extensive experiments on four real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets from Shenzhen, New York City, and Chicago demonstrate that UQGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification. For example, on the Shenzhen dataset, UQGNN achieves a 5% improvement in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, SIGSPATIAL 2025</p></details> |

These limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction performance and lightweight deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Learning on Large Graphs using a Densifying Regularity Lemma](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18273v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning on large graphs presents significant challenges, with traditional Message Passing Neural Networks suffering from computational and memory costs scaling linearly with the number of edges. We introduce the Intersecting Block Graph (IBG), a low-rank factorization of large directed graphs based on combinations of intersecting bipartite components, each consisting of a pair of communities, for source and target nodes. By giving less weight to non-edges, we show how to efficiently approximate any graph, sparse or dense, by a dense IBG. Specifically, we prove a constructive version of the weak regularity lemma, showing that for any chosen accuracy, every graph, regardless of its size or sparsity, can be approximated by a dense IBG whose rank depends only on the accuracy. This dependence of the rank solely on the accuracy, and not on the sparsity level, is in contrast to previous forms of the weak regularity lemma. We present a graph neural network architecture operating on the IBG representation of the graph and demonstrating competitive performance on node classification, spatio-temporal graph analysis, and knowledge graph completion, while having memory and computational complexity linear in the number of nodes rather than edges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Diffusion-Based Model-Level Explanation of Heterogeneous GNNs with Node Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08458v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world datasets, such as citation networks, social networks, and molecular structures, are naturally represented as heterogeneous graphs, where nodes belong to different types and have additional features. For example, in a citation network, nodes representing "Paper" or "Author" may include attributes like keywords or affiliations. A critical machine learning task on these graphs is node classification, which is useful for applications such as fake news detection, corporate risk assessment, and molecular property prediction. Although Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) perform well in these contexts, their predictions remain opaque. Existing post-hoc explanation methods lack support for actual node features beyond one-hot encoding of node type and often fail to generate realistic, faithful explanations. To address these gaps, we propose DiGNNExplainer, a model-level explanation approach that synthesizes heterogeneous graphs with realistic node features via discrete denoising diffusion. In particular, we generate realistic discrete features (e.g., bag-of-words features) using diffusion models within a discrete space, whereas previous approaches are limited to continuous spaces. We evaluate our approach on multiple datasets and show that DiGNNExplainer produces explanations that are realistic and faithful to the model's decision-making, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Understanding of the Dynamics of Model Capacity in Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08052v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The stability-plasticity dilemma, closely related to a neural network's (NN) capacity-its ability to represent tasks-is a fundamental challenge in continual learning (CL). Within this context, we introduce CL's effective model capacity (CLEMC) that characterizes the dynamic behavior of the stability-plasticity balance point. We develop a difference equation to model the evolution of the interplay between the NN, task data, and optimization procedure. We then leverage CLEMC to demonstrate that the effective capacity-and, by extension, the stability-plasticity balance point is inherently non-stationary. We show that regardless of the NN architecture or optimization method, a NN's ability to represent new tasks diminishes when incoming task distributions differ from previous ones. We conduct extensive experiments to support our theoretical findings, spanning a range of architectures-from small feedforward network and convolutional networks to medium-sized graph neural networks and transformer-based large language models with millions of parameters.</p></details> |  |

Through an extensive analysis of relevant studies, it is found that there is a lack of research work concerning algorithm selection oriented toward the Maximum Clique Problem (MCP). In this work, we propose a learning-based framework that integrates both traditional machine learning and graph neural networks to address this gap. We construct a labeled dataset by running four exact MCP algorithms on a diverse collection of graph instances, accompanied by structural and global statistical features extracted from each graph. We first evaluate four conventional classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), across multiple dataset variants. Experimental results show that RF consistently shows strong performance across metrics and dataset variants, making it a reliable baseline. In addition, feature importance analysis indicates that connectivity and topological structure are strong predictors of algorithm performance. Building on these findings, we develop a dual-channel model named GAT-MLP, which combines a Graph Attention Network (GAT) for local structural encoding with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for global feature modeling. The GAT-MLP model shows strong and consistent performance across all metrics. Our results highlight the effectiveness of dual-channel architectures and the promise of graph neural networks in combinatorial algorithm selection.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Our approach captures global geometric information while preserving computational tractability and human-interpretable structure. We evaluate our model across a range of benchmarks, from small-molecule datasets to complex material datasets, and demonstrate superior performance using a parameter-efficient architecture. We achieve the best performing results in both accuracy and robustness across almost all benchmarks.

In HGNN inference, the neighbor aggregation stage is the primary performance determinant, yet it suffers from two major sources of memory inefficiency. First, the commonly adopted per-semantic execution paradigm stores intermediate aggregation results for each semantic prior to semantic fusion, causing substantial memory expansion. Second, the aggregation process incurs extensive redundant memory accesses, including repeated loading of target vertex features across semantics and repeated accesses to shared neighbors due to cross-semantic neighborhood overlap. These inefficiencies severely limit scalability and reduce HGNN inference performance. In this work, we first propose a semantics-complete execution paradigm from a vertex perspective that eliminates per-semantic intermediate storage and redundant target vertex accesses. Building on this paradigm, we design TVL-HGNN, a reconfigurable hardware accelerator optimized for efficient aggregation. In addition, we introduce a vertex grouping technique based on cross-semantic neighborhood overlap, with hardware implementation, to reduce redundant accesses to shared neighbors. Experimental results demonstrate that TVL-HGNN achieves average speedups of 7.85x and 1.41x over the NVIDIA A100 GPU and the state-of-the-art HGNN accelerator HiHGNN, respectively, while reducing energy consumption by 98.79% and 32.61%.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, accepted by ICCD 2025</p></details> |

However, such fixed schemes often suffer from two key limitations. First, they cannot handle the imbalance in node informativeness -- some nodes are rich in information, while others remain sparse. Second, predefined message passing primarily leverages local structural similarity while ignoring global semantic relationships across the graph, limiting the model's ability to capture distant but relevant information. We propose Retrieval-augmented Graph Agentic Network (ReaGAN), an agent-based framework that empowers each node with autonomous, node-level decision-making. Each node acts as an agent that independently plans its next action based on its internal memory, enabling node-level planning and adaptive message propagation. Additionally, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows nodes to access semantically relevant content and build global relationships in the graph. ReaGAN achieves competitive performance under few-shot in-context settings using a frozen LLM backbone without fine-tuning, showcasing the potential of agentic planning and local-global retrieval in graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, work in progress</p></details> |

NWP systems predict future atmospheric states at fixed locations, which are called NWP grid points, by analyzing previous atmospheric states and newly acquired Earth observations without fixed locations. Thus, surrounding meteorological context and the changing locations of the observations make spatial correlations between atmospheric states and observations over time. To handle complicated spatial correlations, which change dynamically, we employ spatiotemporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) with structure learning. However, structure learning has an inherent limitation that this can cause structural information loss and over-smoothing problem by generating excessive edges. To solve this problem, we regulate edge sampling by adaptively determining node degrees and considering the spatial distances between NWP grid points and observations. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method by using real-world atmospheric state and observation data from East Asia. Even in areas with high atmospheric variability, the proposed method outperformed existing STGNN models with and without structure learning.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, state-of-the-art object detection models often fail to leverage this spatial prior, resulting in inconsistent predictions, missed detections, or misclassifications, particularly in cluttered or occluded scenes. In this work, we propose a graph-based post-processing pipeline that explicitly models the spatial relationships between objects to correct detection anomalies in egocentric frames. Using a graph neural network (GNN) trained on manually annotated data, our model identifies invalid object class labels and predicts corrected class labels based on their neighbourhood context. We evaluate our approach both as a standalone anomaly detection and correction framework and as a post-processing module for standard object detectors such as YOLOv7 and RT-DETR. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating this spatial reasoning significantly improves detection performance, with mAP@50 gains of up to 4%. This method highlights the potential of leveraging the environment's spatial structure to improve reliability in object detection systems.</p></details> |  |

These problems often involve high-level task specifications, such as temporal logic or chance constraints, which require solving large-scale Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs). However, existing MILP-based planning methods suffer from high computational cost and limited scalability, hindering their real-time applicability. We propose to use a neuro-symbolic approach to accelerate MILP-based motion planning by leveraging machine learning techniques to guide the solver's symbolic search. Focusing on two representative classes of planning problems, namely, those with Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications and those with chance constraints formulated via Conformal Predictive Programming (CPP). We demonstrate how graph neural network-based learning methods can guide traditional symbolic MILP solvers in solving challenging planning problems, including branching variable selection and solver parameter configuration. Through extensive experiments, we show that neuro-symbolic search techniques yield scalability gains. Our approach yields substantial improvements, achieving an average performance gain of about 20% over state-of-the-art solver across key metrics, including runtime and solution quality.</p></details> |  |

Existing microservice extraction methods typically rely on hard clustering, assigning each software component to a single microservice. This approach often increases inter-service coupling and reduces intra-service cohesion. We propose Mo2oM (Monolithic to Overlapping Microservices), a framework that formulates microservice extraction as a soft clustering problem, allowing components to belong probabilistically to multiple microservices. This approach is inspired by expert-driven decompositions, where practitioners intentionally replicate certain software components across services to reduce communication overhead. Mo2oM combines deep semantic embeddings with structural dependencies extracted from methodcall graphs to capture both functional and architectural relationships. A graph neural network-based soft clustering algorithm then generates the final set of microservices. We evaluate Mo2oM on four open-source monolithic benchmarks and compare it against eight state-of-the-art baselines. Our results demonstrate that Mo2oM achieves improvements of up to 40.97% in structural modularity (balancing cohesion and coupling), 58% in inter-service call percentage (communication overhead), 26.16% in interface number (modularity and decoupling), and 38.96% in non-extreme distribution (service size balance) across all benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, the high dimensionality and complex interactions among omics layers present major challenges for predictive modeling. We propose Multi-Omics integration with Tree-generated Graph Neural Network (MOTGNN), a novel and interpretable framework for binary disease classification. MOTGNN employs eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to perform omics-specific supervised graph construction, followed by modality-specific Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for hierarchical representation learning, and a deep feedforward network for cross-omics integration. On three real-world disease datasets, MOTGNN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 5-10% in accuracy, ROC-AUC, and F1-score, and remains robust to severe class imbalance (e.g., 87.2% vs. 33.4% F1 on imbalanced data). The model maintains computational efficiency through sparse graphs (2.1-2.8 edges per node) and provides built-in interpretability, revealing both top-ranked biomarkers and the relative contributions of each omics modality. These results highlight MOTGNN's potential to improve both predictive accuracy and interpretability in multi-omics disease modeling.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

With upgrades scheduled for the detectors of colliding-beam experiments around the world, and specifically at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, more collisions and more complex interactions are expected. This directly implies an increase in data produced and consequently in the computational resources needed to process them. At CERN, the amount of data produced is gargantuan. This is why the data have to be heavily filtered and selected in real time before being permanently stored. This data can then be used to perform physics analyses, in order to expand our current understanding of the universe and improve the Standard Model of physics. This real-time filtering, known as triggering, involves complex processing happening often at frequencies as high as 40 MHz. This thesis contributes to understanding how machine learning models can be efficiently deployed in such environments, in order to maximize throughput and minimize energy consumption. Inevitably, modern hardware designed for such tasks and contemporary algorithms are needed in order to meet the challenges posed by the stringent, high-frequency data rates. In this work, I present our graph neural network-based pipeline, developed for charged particle track reconstruction at the LHCb experiment at CERN. The pipeline was implemented end-to-end inside LHCb's first-level trigger, entirely on GPUs. Its performance was compared against the classical tracking algorithms currently in production at LHCb. The pipeline was also accelerated on the FPGA architecture, and its performance in terms of power consumption and processing speed was compared against the GPU implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD t...</summary><p>PhD thesis, Chapters 8 and 9 include results from work performed in collaboration with Anthony Correia</p></details> |
| **[HSA-Net: Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Framework for Efficient and Scalable Molecular Language Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08334v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular representation learning, a cornerstone for downstream tasks like molecular captioning and molecular property prediction, heavily relies on Graph Neural Networks (GNN). However, GNN suffers from the over-smoothing problem, where node-level features collapse in deep GNN layers. While existing feature projection methods with cross-attention have been introduced to mitigate this issue, they still perform poorly in deep features. This motivated our exploration of using Mamba as an alternative projector for its ability to handle complex sequences. However, we observe that while Mamba excels at preserving global topological information from deep layers, it neglects fine-grained details in shallow layers. The capabilities of Mamba and cross-attention exhibit a global-local trade-off. To resolve this critical global-local trade-off, we propose Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Network (HSA-Net), a novel framework with two modules that enables a hierarchical feature projection and fusion. Firstly, a Hierarchical Adaptive Projector (HAP) module is introduced to process features from different graph layers. It learns to dynamically switch between a cross-attention projector for shallow layers and a structure-aware Graph-Mamba projector for deep layers, producing high-quality, multi-level features. Secondly, to adaptively merge these multi-level features, we design a Source-Aware Fusion (SAF) module, which flexibly selects fusion experts based on the characteristics of the aggregation features, ensuring a precise and effective final representation fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HSA-Net framework quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bidirectional Hierarchical Protein Multi-Modal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04770v2)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Protein representation learning is critical for numerous biological tasks. Recently, large transformer-based protein language models (pLMs) pretrained on large scale protein sequences have demonstrated significant success in sequence-based tasks. However, pLMs lack structural context. Conversely, graph neural networks (GNNs) designed to leverage 3D structural information have shown promising generalization in protein-related prediction tasks, but their effectiveness is often constrained by the scarcity of labeled structural data. Recognizing that sequence and structural representations are complementary perspectives of the same protein entity, we propose a multimodal bidirectional hierarchical fusion framework to effectively merge these modalities. Our framework employs attention and gating mechanisms to enable effective interaction between pLMs-generated sequential representations and GNN-extracted structural features, improving information exchange and enhancement across layers of the neural network. This bidirectional and hierarchical (Bi-Hierarchical) fusion approach leverages the strengths of both modalities to capture richer and more comprehensive protein representations. Based on the framework, we further introduce local Bi-Hierarchical Fusion with gating and global Bi-Hierarchical Fusion with multihead self-attention approaches. Our method demonstrates consistent improvements over strong baselines and existing fusion techniques in a variety of protein representation learning benchmarks, including enzyme EC classification, model quality assessment, protein-ligand binding affinity prediction, protein-protein binding site prediction, and B cell epitopes prediction. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art for multimodal protein representation learning, emphasizing the efficacy of Bi-Hierarchical Fusion in bridging sequence and structural modalities.</p></details> |  |

The method abstracts system states at different time slices into a sequence of graph structures. It integrates the runtime features of service nodes with the invocation relationships among services to construct a unified spatiotemporal modeling framework. The model first applies a graph convolutional network to extract high-order dependency information from the service topology. Then it uses a gated recurrent network to capture the dynamic evolution of performance metrics over time. A time encoding mechanism is also introduced to enhance the model's ability to represent non-stationary temporal sequences. The architecture is trained in an end-to-end manner, optimizing the multi-layer nested structure to achieve high-precision regression of future service performance metrics. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a large-scale public cluster dataset is used. A series of multi-dimensional experiments are designed, including variations in time windows and concurrent load levels. These experiments comprehensively evaluate the model's predictive performance and stability. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms existing representative methods across key metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R2. It maintains strong robustness under varying load intensities and structural complexities. These results demonstrate the model's practical potential for backend service performance management tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Nodes to Narratives: Explaining Graph Neural Networks with LLMs and Graph Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07117v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning over structured data, including text-attributed graphs, which are common in domains such as citation networks, social platforms, and knowledge graphs. GNNs are not inherently interpretable and thus, many explanation methods have been proposed. However, existing explanation methods often struggle to generate interpretable, fine-grained rationales, especially when node attributes include rich natural language. In this work, we introduce LOGIC, a lightweight, post-hoc framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate faithful and interpretable explanations for GNN predictions. LOGIC projects GNN node embeddings into the LLM embedding space and constructs hybrid prompts that interleave soft prompts with textual inputs from the graph structure. This enables the LLM to reason about GNN internal representations and produce natural language explanations along with concise explanation subgraphs. Our experiments across four real-world TAG datasets demonstrate that LOGIC achieves a favorable trade-off between fidelity and sparsity, while significantly improving human-centric metrics such as insightfulness. LOGIC sets a new direction for LLM-based explainability in graph learning by aligning GNN internals with human reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

These functional connectivity dynamics may be related to behaviour and neuropsychiatric disease. To model these dynamics, temporal brain connectivity representations are essential, as they reflect evolving interactions between brain regions and provide insight into transient neural states and network reconfigurations. However, conventional graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle to capture long-range temporal dependencies in dynamic fMRI data. To address this challenge, we propose BrainATCL, an unsupervised, nonparametric framework for adaptive temporal brain connectivity learning, enabling functional link prediction and age estimation. Our method dynamically adjusts the lookback window for each snapshot based on the rate of newly added edges. Graph sequences are subsequently encoded using a GINE-Mamba2 backbone to learn spatial-temporal representations of dynamic functional connectivity in resting-state fMRI data of 1,000 participants from the Human Connectome Project. To further improve spatial modeling, we incorporate brain structure and function-informed edge attributes, i.e., the left/right hemispheric identity and subnetwork membership of brain regions, enabling the model to capture biologically meaningful topological patterns. We evaluate our BrainATCL on two tasks: functional link prediction and age estimation. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance and strong generalization, including in cross-session prediction scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, this task remains challenging due to low contrast with surrounding mucosa, specular highlights, and indistinct boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose FOCUS-Med, which stands for Fusion of spatial and structural graph with attentional context-aware polyp segmentation in endoscopic medical imaging. FOCUS-Med integrates a Dual Graph Convolutional Network (Dual-GCN) module to capture contextual spatial and topological structural dependencies. This graph-based representation enables the model to better distinguish polyps from background tissues by leveraging topological cues and spatial connectivity, which are often obscured in raw image intensities. It enhances the model's ability to preserve boundaries and delineate complex shapes typical of polyps. In addition, a location-fused stand-alone self-attention is employed to strengthen global context integration. To bridge the semantic gap between encoder-decoder layers, we incorporate a trainable weighted fast normalized fusion strategy for efficient multi-scale aggregation. Notably, we are the first to introduce the use of a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide detailed qualitative evaluations of segmentation quality. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that FOCUS-Med achieves state-of-the-art performance across five key metrics, underscoring its effectiveness and clinical potential for AI-assisted colonoscopy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript under review</p></details> |

However, existing spiking GNNs predominantly operate in Euclidean space and rely on fixed geometric assumptions, limiting their capacity to model complex graph structures such as hierarchies and cycles. To overcome these limitations, we propose \method{}, a novel Geometry-Aware Spiking Graph Neural Network that unifies spike-based neural dynamics with adaptive representation learning on Riemannian manifolds. \method{} features three key components: a Riemannian Embedding Layer that projects node features into a pool of constant-curvature manifolds, capturing non-Euclidean structures; a Manifold Spiking Layer that models membrane potential evolution and spiking behavior in curved spaces via geometry-consistent neighbor aggregation and curvature-based attention; and a Manifold Learning Objective that enables instance-wise geometry adaptation through jointly optimized classification and link prediction losses defined over geodesic distances. All modules are trained using Riemannian SGD, eliminating the need for backpropagation through time. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that GSG achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and energy efficiency compared to both Euclidean SNNs and manifold-based GNNs, establishing a new paradigm for curvature-aware, energy-efficient graph learning.</p></details> |  |

This highlights a key limitation in existing approaches: both the model architectures and their structure-only representations often fail to capture deeper semantic patterns. In this work, we propose a robust semantic enrichment framework that enhances function call graphs with contextual features, including function-level metadata and, when available, code embeddings derived from large language models. The framework is designed to operate under real-world constraints where feature availability is inconsistent, and supports flexible integration of semantic signals. To evaluate generalization under realistic domain and temporal shifts, we introduce two new benchmarks: MalNet-Tiny-Common and MalNet-Tiny-Distinct, constructed using malware family partitioning to simulate cross-family generalization and evolving threat behavior. Experiments across multiple graph neural network backbones show that our method improves classification performance by up to 8% under distribution shift and consistently enhances robustness when integrated with adaptation-based methods. These results offer a practical path toward building resilient malware detection systems in evolving threat environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, 7 tables, under review</p></details> |

Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), a recent architecture with learnable univariate functions, offer strong nonlinear expressiveness and efficient inference. In this work, we integrate KANs into three popular GNN architectures-GAT, SGC, and APPNP-resulting in three new models: KGAT, KSGC, and KAPPNP. We further adopt a multi-teacher knowledge amalgamation framework, where knowledge from multiple KAN-based GNNs is distilled into a graph-independent KAN student model. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed models improve node classification accuracy, and the knowledge amalgamation approach significantly boosts student model performance. Our findings highlight the potential of KANs for enhancing GNN expressiveness and for enabling efficient, graph-free inference.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 tables |

However, reliance on outdated baselines may exaggerate the benefits of these new approaches. To tackle this issue, we systematically explore Graph Autoencoders (GAEs) by applying model-agnostic tricks in recent methods and tuning hyperparameters. We find that a well-tuned GAE can match the performance of recent sophisticated models while offering superior computational efficiency on widely-used link prediction benchmarks. Our approach delivers substantial performance gains on datasets where structural information dominates and feature data is limited. Specifically, our GAE achieves a state-of-the-art Hits@100 score of 78.41\% on the ogbl-ppa dataset. Furthermore, we examine the impact of various tricks to uncover the reasons behind our success and to guide the design of future methods.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently demonstrated remarkable ability to exploit relational structures in biological data, enabling advances in multi-omics integration for cancer subtype classification. Existing approaches often neglect the intricate coupling between heterogeneous omics, limiting their capacity to resolve subtle cancer subtype heterogeneity critical for precision oncology. To address these limitations, we propose a framework named Graph Transformer for Multi-omics Cancer Subtype Classification (GTMancer). This framework builds upon the GNN optimization problem and extends its application to complex multi-omics data. Specifically, our method leverages contrastive learning to embed multi-omics data into a unified semantic space. We unroll the multiplex graph optimization problem in that unified space and introduce dual sets of attention coefficients to capture structural graph priors both within and among multi-omics data. This approach enables global omics information to guide the refining of the representations of individual omics. Empirical experiments on seven real-world cancer datasets demonstrate that GTMancer outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose an ensemble-based graph representation method of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data for the task of binary brain-state classification. Our method builds the graph by leveraging multiple base machine-learning models: each edge weight reflects the difference in posterior probabilities between two cognitive states, yielding values in the range [-1, 1] that encode confidence in a given state. We applied this approach to seven cognitive tasks from the Human Connectome Project (HCP 1200 Subject Release), including working memory, gambling, motor activity, language, social cognition, relational processing, and emotion processing. Using only the mean incident edge weights of the graphs as features, a simple logistic-regression classifier achieved average accuracies from 97.07% to 99.74%. We also compared our ensemble graphs with classical correlation-based graphs in a classification task with a graph neural network (GNN). In all experiments, the highest classification accuracy was obtained with ensemble graphs. These results demonstrate that ensemble graphs convey richer topological information and enhance brain-state discrimination. Our approach preserves edge-level interpretability of the fMRI graph representation, is adaptable to multiclass and regression tasks, and can be extended to other neuroimaging modalities and pathological-state classification.</p></details> |  |

However, GNNs often struggle to capture global structural characteristics, such as crystal systems, limiting their predictive performance. To overcome this issue, we propose CAST, a cross-attention-based multimodal model that integrates graph representations with textual descriptions of materials, effectively preserving critical structural and compositional information. Unlike previous approaches, such as CrysMMNet and MultiMat, which rely on aggregated material-level embeddings, CAST leverages cross-attention mechanisms to combine fine-grained graph node-level and text token-level features. Additionally, we introduce a masked node prediction pretraining strategy that further enhances the alignment between node and text embeddings. Our experimental results demonstrate that CAST outperforms existing baseline models across four key material properties-formation energy, band gap, bulk modulus, and shear modulus-with average relative MAE improvements ranging from 10.2% to 35.7%. Analysis of attention maps confirms the importance of pretraining in effectively aligning multimodal representations. This study underscores the potential of multimodal learning frameworks for developing more accurate and globally informed predictive models in materials science.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

This research has been been initialised by an influential result of Barcel\'o et al. (2020), who showed that the graded modal logic (or a guarded fragment of the logic C2), characterises the logical expressiveness of aggregate-combine GNNs. As a ``challenging open problem'' they left the question whether full C2 characterises the logical expressiveness of aggregate-combine-readout GNNs. This question has remained unresolved despite several attempts. In this paper, we solve the above open problem by proving that the logical expressiveness of aggregate-combine-readout GNNs strictly exceeds that of C2. This result holds over both undirected and directed graphs. Beyond its implications for GNNs, our work also leads to purely logical insights on the expressive power of infinitary logics.</p></details> | 18 pages |

Using Graph Neural Networks to detect these threats has become a research focus and has demonstrated exceptional performance. However, the widespread adoption of GNN-based security models is limited by their inherent black-box nature, as they fail to provide security analysts with any verifiable explanations for model predictions or any evidence regarding the model's judgment in relation to real-world attacks. To address this challenge, we propose ProvX, an effective explanation framework for exlaining GNN-based security models on provenance graphs. ProvX introduces counterfactual explanation logic, seeking the minimal structural subset within a graph predicted as malicious that, when perturbed, can subvert the model's original prediction. We innovatively transform the discrete search problem of finding this critical subgraph into a continuous optimization task guided by a dual objective of prediction flipping and distance minimization. Furthermore, a Staged Solidification strategy is incorporated to enhance the precision and stability of the explanations. We conducted extensive evaluations of ProvX on authoritative datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that ProvX can locate critical graph structures that are highly relevant to real-world attacks and achieves an average explanation necessity of 51.59\%, with these metrics outperforming current SOTA explainers. Furthermore, we explore and provide a preliminary validation of a closed-loop Detection-Explanation-Feedback enhancement framework, demonstrating through experiments that the explanation results from ProvX can guide model optimization, effectively enhancing its robustness against adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing studies focus on either heterogeneity or heterophily in isolation, overlooking the prevalence of heterophilic HGs in practical applications. Such ignorance leads to their performance degradation. In this work, we first identify two main challenges in modeling heterophily HGs: (1) varying heterophily distributions across hops and meta-paths; (2) the intricate and often heterophily-driven diversity of semantic information across different meta-paths. Then, we propose the Adaptive Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (AHGNN) to tackle these challenges. AHGNN employs a heterophily-aware convolution that accounts for heterophily distributions specific to both hops and meta-paths. It then integrates messages from diverse semantic spaces using a coarse-to-fine attention mechanism, which filters out noise and emphasizes informative signals. Experiments on seven real-world graphs and twenty baselines demonstrate the superior performance of AHGNN, particularly in high-heterophily situations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted tp CIKM 2025</p></details> |

However, traditional GNNs primarily focus on adjacency relationships between nodes, often overlooking the rich role-based characteristics that are crucial for learning more expressive node representations. Existing methods for capturing role-based features are largely unsupervised and fail to achieve optimal performance in downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a novel hypergraph neural network with state space model (HGMN) that effectively integrates role-aware representations into GNNs and the state space model. HGMN utilizes hypergraph construction techniques to model higher-order relationships and combines role-based and adjacency-based representations through a learnable mamba transformer mechanism. By leveraging two distinct hypergraph construction methods-based on node degree and neighborhood levels, it strengthens the connections among nodes with similar roles, enhancing the model's representational power. Additionally, the inclusion of hypergraph convolution layers enables the model to capture complex dependencies within hypergraph structures. To mitigate the over-smoothing problem inherent in deep GNNs, we incorporate a residual network, ensuring improved stability and better feature propagation across layers. Extensive experiments conducted on one newly introduced dataset and four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of HGMN. The model achieves significant performance improvements on node classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art GNN methods. These results highlight HGMN's ability to provide enriched node representations by effectively embedding role-based features alongside adjacency information, making it a versatile and powerful tool for a variety of graph-based learning applications.</p></details> |  |

We constructed a database of 659 distinct physical equations, subjected to rigorous semantic cleaning to resolve notational ambiguities, resulting in a corpus of 400 advanced physics equations. We developed an enhanced graph representation where both physical concepts and equations are nodes, connected by weighted inter-equation bridges. These weights are objectively defined using normalized metrics for variable overlap, physics-informed importance scores, and bibliometric data. A Graph Attention Network (GAT) was trained for link prediction, achieving a test AUC of 0.9742 +/- 0.0018 across five independent runs, significantly outperforming both classical heuristics (best baseline AUC: 0.9487) and established GNN architectures like GraphSAGE (AUC: 0.9504, p = 0.029). Statistical testing confirmed significance of all comparisons (p < 0.05), with 2.7% improvement over the best baseline. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (i) The model autonomously rediscovers the known macroscopic structure of physics, identifying strong conceptual axes between Electromagnetism and Statistical Mechanics. (ii) It identifies central hub equations that serve as critical bridges between multiple physical domains. (iii) The model generates stable, computationally-derived hypotheses for cross-domain relationships, identifying both known principles and suggesting novel mathematical analogies for further theoretical investigation.

| **[When Deepfake Detection Meets Graph Neural Network:a Unified and Lightweight Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05526v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of generative video models has made detecting AI-generated and manipulated videos an urgent challenge. Existing detection approaches often fail to generalize across diverse manipulation types due to their reliance on isolated spatial, temporal, or spectral information, and typically require large models to perform well. This paper introduces SSTGNN, a lightweight Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Graph Neural Network framework that represents videos as structured graphs, enabling joint reasoning over spatial inconsistencies, temporal artifacts, and spectral distortions. SSTGNN incorporates learnable spectral filters and temporal differential modeling into a graph-based architecture, capturing subtle manipulation traces more effectively. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that SSTGNN not only achieves superior performance in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, but also offers strong robustness against unseen manipulations. Remarkably, SSTGNN accomplishes these results with up to 42.4$\times$ fewer parameters than state-of-the-art models, making it highly lightweight and scalable for real-world deployment.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[Learning Geometric-Aware Quadrature Rules for Functional Minimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05445v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate numerical integration over non-uniform point clouds is a challenge for modern mesh-free machine learning solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) using variational principles. While standard Monte Carlo (MC) methods are not capable of handling a non-uniform point cloud, modern neural network architectures can deal with permutation-invariant inputs, creating quadrature rules for any point cloud. In this work, we introduce QuadrANN, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture designed to learn optimal quadrature weights directly from the underlying geometry of point clouds. The design of the model exploits a deep message-passing scheme where the initial layer encodes rich local geometric features from absolute and relative positions as well as an explicit local density measure. In contrast, the following layers incorporate a global context vector. These architectural choices allow the QuadrANN to generate a data-driven quadrature rule that is permutation-invariant and adaptive to both local point density and the overall domain shape. We test our methodology on a series of challenging test cases, including integration on convex and non-convex domains and estimating the solution of the Heat and Fokker-Planck equations. Across all the tests, QuadrANN reduces the variance of the integral estimation compared to standard Quasi-Monte Carlo methods by warping the point clouds to be more dense in critical areas where the integrands present certain singularities. This enhanced stability in critical areas of the domain at hand is critical for the optimization of energy functionals, leading to improved deep learning-based variational solvers.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |

Trained on millions of reported transformations, these text-based models can propose synthetic routes, forecast reaction outcomes and even instruct robots that execute experiments without human supervision. Here we survey the milestones that turned LLMs from speculative tools into practical lab partners. We show how coupling LLMs with graph neural networks, quantum calculations and real-time spectroscopy shrinks discovery cycles and supports greener, data-driven chemistry. We discuss limitations, including biased datasets, opaque reasoning and the need for safety gates that prevent unintentional hazards. Finally, we outline community initiatives open benchmarks, federated learning and explainable interfaces that aim to democratize access while keeping humans firmly in control. These advances chart a path towards rapid, reliable and inclusive molecular innovation powered by artificial intelligence and automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deformable Attention Graph Representation Learning for Histopathology Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05382v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate classification of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and Regions of Interest (ROIs) is a fundamental challenge in computational pathology. While mainstream approaches often adopt Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), they struggle to capture the spatial dependencies among tissue structures. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a solution to model inter-instance relationships, yet most rely on static graph topologies and overlook the physical spatial positions of tissue patches. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms lack specificity, limiting their ability to focus on structurally relevant regions. In this work, we propose a novel GNN framework with deformable attention for pathology image analysis. We construct a dynamic weighted directed graph based on patch features, where each node aggregates contextual information from its neighbors via attention-weighted edges. Specifically, we incorporate learnable spatial offsets informed by the real coordinates of each patch, enabling the model to adaptively attend to morphologically relevant regions across the slide. This design significantly enhances the contextual field while preserving spatial specificity. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets (TCGA-COAD, BRACS, gastric intestinal metaplasia grading, and intestinal ROI classification), demonstrating the power of deformable attention in capturing complex spatial structures in WSIs and ROIs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Polytopal mesh agglomeration via geometrical deep learning for three-dimensional heterogeneous domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10587v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agglomeration techniques can be successfully employed to reduce the computational costs of numerical simulations and stand at the basis of multilevel algebraic solvers. To automatically perform mesh agglomeration, we propose a novel Geometrical Deep Learning-based algorithm that can exploit the geometrical and physical information of the underlying computational domain to construct the agglomerated grid and -- simultaneously -- guarantee the agglomerated grid's quality. In particular, we propose a bisection model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to partition a suitable connectivity graph of computational three-dimensional meshes. The new approach has a high online inference speed. It can simultaneously process the graph structure of the mesh, the geometrical information of the mesh (e.g., elements' volumes, centers' coordinates), and the physical information of the domain (e.g., physical parameters). Taking advantage of this new approach, our algorithm can agglomerate meshes of a domain composed of heterogeneous media, automatically respecting the underlying heterogeneities. The proposed GNN approach is compared with the k-means algorithm and METIS, which are widely employed approaches for graph partitioning and are meant to process only the connectivity information on the mesh. We demonstrate that the performance of our algorithms outperforms the k-means and METIS algorithms in terms of quality metrics and runtimes. Moreover, we demonstrate that our algorithm also shows a good level of generalization when applied to complex geometries, such as three-dimensional geometries reconstructed from medical images. Finally, the model's capability to perform agglomeration in heterogeneous domains is evaluated when integrated into a polytopal discontinuous Galerkin finite element solver.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Pixels: Medical Image Quality Assessment with Implicit Neural Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05168v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artifacts pose a significant challenge in medical imaging, impacting diagnostic accuracy and downstream analysis. While image-based approaches for detecting artifacts can be effective, they often rely on preprocessing methods that can lead to information loss and high-memory-demand medical images, thereby limiting the scalability of classification models. In this work, we propose the use of implicit neural representations (INRs) for image quality assessment. INRs provide a compact and continuous representation of medical images, naturally handling variations in resolution and image size while reducing memory overhead. We develop deep weight space networks, graph neural networks, and relational attention transformers that operate on INRs to achieve image quality assessment. Our method is evaluated on the ACDC dataset with synthetically generated artifact patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in assessing image quality while achieving similar performance with fewer parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 16th Machine Learning in Medical Imaging (MLMI 2025) workshop</p></details> |
| **[Graph-based Event Log Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05145v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quality of event logs in Process Mining is crucial when applying any form of analysis to them. In real-world event logs, the acquisition of data can be non-trivial (e.g., due to the execution of manual activities and related manual recording or to issues in collecting, for each event, all its attributes), and often may end up with events recorded with some missing information. Standard approaches to the problem of trace (or log) reconstruction either require the availability of a process model that is used to fill missing values by leveraging different reasoning techniques or employ a Machine Learning/Deep Learning model to restore the missing values by learning from similar cases. In recent years, a new type of Deep Learning model that is capable of handling input data encoded as graphs has emerged, namely Graph Neural Networks. Graph Neural Network models, and even more so Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks, offer the advantage of working with a more natural representation of complex multi-modal sequences like the execution traces in Process Mining, allowing for more expressive and semantically rich encodings. In this work, we focus on the development of a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network model that, given a trace containing some incomplete events, will return the full set of attributes missing from those events. We evaluate our work against a state-of-the-art approach leveraging autoencoders on two synthetic logs and four real event logs, on different types of missing values. Different from state-of-the-art model-free approaches, which mainly focus on repairing a subset of event attributes, the proposed approach shows very good performance in reconstructing all different event attributes.</p></details> |  |
| **[TANGO: Graph Neural Dynamics via Learned Energy and Tangential Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05070v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce TANGO -- a dynamical systems inspired framework for graph representation learning that governs node feature evolution through a learned energy landscape and its associated descent dynamics. At the core of our approach is a learnable Lyapunov function over node embeddings, whose gradient defines an energy-reducing direction that guarantees convergence and stability. To enhance flexibility while preserving the benefits of energy-based dynamics, we incorporate a novel tangential component, learned via message passing, that evolves features while maintaining the energy value. This decomposition into orthogonal flows of energy gradient descent and tangential evolution yields a flexible form of graph dynamics, and enables effective signal propagation even in flat or ill-conditioned energy regions, that often appear in graph learning. Our method mitigates oversquashing and is compatible with different graph neural network backbones. Empirically, TANGO achieves strong performance across a diverse set of node and graph classification and regression benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of jointly learned energy functions and tangential flows for graph neural networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Will You Be Aware? Eye Tracking-Based Modeling of Situational Awareness in Augmented Reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05025v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Augmented Reality (AR) systems, while enhancing task performance through real-time guidance, pose risks of inducing cognitive tunneling-a hyperfocus on virtual content that compromises situational awareness (SA) in safety-critical scenarios. This paper investigates SA in AR-guided cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), where responders must balance effective compressions with vigilance to unpredictable hazards (e.g., patient vomiting). We developed an AR app on a Magic Leap 2 that overlays real-time CPR feedback (compression depth and rate) and conducted a user study with simulated unexpected incidents (e.g., bleeding) to evaluate SA, in which SA metrics were collected via observation and questionnaires administered during freeze-probe events. Eye tracking analysis revealed that higher SA levels were associated with greater saccadic amplitude and velocity, and with reduced proportion and frequency of fixations on virtual content. To predict SA, we propose FixGraphPool, a graph neural network that structures gaze events (fixations, saccades) into spatiotemporal graphs, effectively capturing dynamic attentional patterns. Our model achieved 83.0% accuracy (F1=81.0%), outperforming feature-based machine learning and state-of-the-art time-series models by leveraging domain knowledge and spatial-temporal information encoded in ET data. These findings demonstrate the potential of eye tracking for SA modeling in AR and highlight its utility in designing AR systems that ensure user safety and situational awareness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing and Enhancing the Robustness of GNN-based QEC Decoders with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03783v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful, data-driven approach for Quantum Error Correction (QEC) decoding, capable of learning complex noise characteristics directly from syndrome data. However, the robustness of these decoders against subtle, adversarial perturbations remains a critical open question. This work introduces a novel framework to systematically probe the vulnerabilities of a GNN decoder using a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. The RL agent is trained as an adversary with the goal of finding minimal syndrome modifications that cause the decoder to misclassify. We apply this framework to a Graph Attention Network (GAT) decoder trained on experimental surface code data from Google Quantum AI. Our results show that the RL agent can successfully identify specific, critical vulnerabilities, achieving a high attack success rate with a minimal number of bit flips. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the decoder's robustness can be significantly enhanced through adversarial training, where the model is retrained on the adversarial examples generated by the RL agent. This iterative process of automated vulnerability discovery and targeted retraining presents a promising methodology for developing more reliable and robust neural network decoders for fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p></details> | 4 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Adversarial Attacks and Defenses on Graph-aware Large Language Models (LLMs)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04894v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated with graph-structured data for tasks like node classification, a domain traditionally dominated by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). While this integration leverages rich relational information to improve task performance, their robustness against adversarial attacks remains unexplored. We take the first step to explore the vulnerabilities of graph-aware LLMs by leveraging existing adversarial attack methods tailored for graph-based models, including those for poisoning (training-time attacks) and evasion (test-time attacks), on two representative models, LLAGA (Chen et al. 2024) and GRAPHPROMPTER (Liu et al. 2024). Additionally, we discover a new attack surface for LLAGA where an attacker can inject malicious nodes as placeholders into the node sequence template to severely degrade its performance. Our systematic analysis reveals that certain design choices in graph encoding can enhance attack success, with specific findings that: (1) the node sequence template in LLAGA increases its vulnerability; (2) the GNN encoder used in GRAPHPROMPTER demonstrates greater robustness; and (3) both approaches remain susceptible to imperceptible feature perturbation attacks. Finally, we propose an end-to-end defense framework GALGUARD, that combines an LLM-based feature correction module to mitigate feature-level perturbations and adapted GNN defenses to protect against structural attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Scalable Pretraining Framework for Link Prediction with Efficient Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04645v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Link Prediction (LP) is a critical task in graph machine learning. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced LP performance recently, existing methods face key challenges including limited supervision from sparse connectivity, sensitivity to initialization, and poor generalization under distribution shifts. We explore pretraining as a solution to address these challenges. Unlike node classification, LP is inherently a pairwise task, which requires the integration of both node- and edge-level information. In this work, we present the first systematic study on the transferability of these distinct modules and propose a late fusion strategy to effectively combine their outputs for improved performance. To handle the diversity of pretraining data and avoid negative transfer, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that captures distinct patterns in separate experts, facilitating seamless application of the pretrained model on diverse downstream datasets. For fast adaptation, we develop a parameter-efficient tuning strategy that allows the pretrained model to adapt to unseen datasets with minimal computational overhead. Experiments on 16 datasets across two domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance on low-resource link prediction while obtaining competitive results compared to end-to-end trained methods, with over 10,000x lower computational overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2025 Research Track</p></details> |
| **[Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Remaining Useful Life Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04336v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) plays a crucial role in the prognostics and health management of industrial systems that involve a variety of interrelated sensors. Given a constant stream of time series sensory data from such systems, deep learning models have risen to prominence at identifying complex, nonlinear temporal dependencies in these data. In addition to the temporal dependencies of individual sensors, spatial dependencies emerge as important correlations among these sensors, which can be naturally modelled by a temporal graph that describes time-varying spatial relationships. However, the majority of existing studies have relied on capturing discrete snapshots of this temporal graph, a coarse-grained approach that leads to loss of temporal information. Moreover, given the variety of heterogeneous sensors, it becomes vital that such inherent heterogeneity is leveraged for RUL prediction in temporal sensor graphs. To capture the nuances of the temporal and spatial relationships and heterogeneous characteristics in an interconnected graph of sensors, we introduce a novel model named Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (THGNN). Specifically, THGNN aggregates historical data from neighboring nodes to accurately capture the temporal dynamics and spatial correlations within the stream of sensor data in a fine-grained manner. Moreover, the model leverages Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to address the diversity of sensor types, significantly improving the model's capacity to learn the heterogeneity in the data sources. Finally, we have validated the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments. Our empirical findings demonstrate significant advancements on the N-CMAPSS dataset, achieving improvements of up to 19.2% and 31.6% in terms of two different evaluation metrics over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 14 pages |

By analyzing over 5,000 empirical identity theft and fraud cases, this research identifies which types of personal data are exposed, how frequently exposures occur, and what the consequences of those exposures are. We construct an Identity Ecosystem graph--a foundational, graph-based model in which nodes represent personally identifiable information (PII) attributes and edges represent empirical disclosure relationships between them (e.g., the probability that one PII attribute is exposed due to the exposure of another). Leveraging this graph structure, we develop a privacy risk prediction framework that uses graph theory and graph neural networks to estimate the likelihood of further disclosures when certain PII attributes are compromised. The results show that our approach effectively answers the core question: Can the disclosure of a given identity attribute possibly lead to the disclosure of another attribute?</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

This paper proposes a hybrid trajectory planning framework that integrates the adaptability of learning-based methods with the formal safety guarantees of optimization-based approaches. The framework features a two-layer architecture: an upper layer employing a graph neural network (GNN) trained on real-world highway data to predict human-like longitudinal velocity profiles, and a lower layer utilizing path optimization formulated as a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem. The primary contribution is the lower-layer path optimization model, which introduces a linear approximation of discretized vehicle geometry to substantially reduce computational complexity, while enforcing strict spatiotemporal non-overlapping constraints to formally guarantee collision avoidance throughout the planning horizon. Experimental results demonstrate that the planner generates highly smooth, collision-free trajectories in complex real-world emergency scenarios, achieving success rates exceeding 97% with average planning times of 54 ms, thereby confirming real-time capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Regression for Spatial-Temporal Sensor Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06917v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing deployment of low-cost, distributed sensor networks in environmental and biomedical domains has enabled continuous, large-scale health monitoring. However, these systems often face challenges related to degraded data quality caused by sensor drift, noise, and insufficient calibration -- factors that limit their reliability in real-world applications. Traditional machine learning methods for sensor fusion and calibration rely on extensive feature engineering and struggle to capture spatial-temporal dependencies or adapt to distribution shifts across varying deployment conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method tailored for regression tasks. Our proposed method integrates effectively with Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks and leverages the alignment of perturbed inverse Gram matrices between source and target domains, drawing inspiration from Tikhonov regularization. This approach enables scalable and efficient domain adaptation without requiring labeled data in the target domain. We validate our novel method on real-world datasets from two distinct applications: air quality monitoring and EEG signal reconstruction. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance which paves the way for more robust and transferable sensor fusion models in both environmental and physiological contexts.

Existing methods typically extract identity features from individual impressions in isolation, restricting their ability to capture consistent and discriminative representations. To overcome these limitations, a few-shot learning framework, ProtoN, is proposed to jointly process multiple impressions of an identity using a graph-based approach. Each impression is represented as a node in a class-specific graph, alongside a learnable prototype node that encodes identity-level information. This graph is processed by a Prototype Graph Neural Network (PGNN) layer, specifically designed to refine both impression and prototype representations through a dual-path message-passing mechanism. To further enhance discriminative power, the PGNN incorporates a cross-graph prototype alignment strategy that improves class separability by enforcing intra-class compactness while maintaining inter-class distinction. Additionally, a hybrid loss function is employed to balance episodic and global classification objectives, thereby improving the overall structure of the embedding space. Extensive experiments on five benchmark ear datasets demonstrate that ProtoN achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Rank-1 identification accuracy of up to 99.60% and an Equal Error Rate (EER) as low as 0.025, showing the effectiveness for few-shot ear recognition under limited data conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Circuit-Aware SAT Solving: Guiding CDCL via Conditional Probabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04235v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Circuit Satisfiability (CSAT) plays a pivotal role in Electronic Design Automation. The standard workflow for solving CSAT problems converts circuits into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) and employs generic SAT solvers powered by Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL). However, this process inherently discards rich structural and functional information, leading to suboptimal solver performance. To address this limitation, we introduce CASCAD, a novel circuit-aware SAT solving framework that directly leverages circuit-level conditional probabilities computed via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By explicitly modeling gate-level conditional probabilities, CASCAD dynamically guides two critical CDCL heuristics -- variable phase selection and clause managementto significantly enhance solver efficiency. Extensive evaluations on challenging real-world Logical Equivalence Checking (LEC) benchmarks demonstrate that CASCAD reduces solving times by up to 10x compared to state-of-the-art CNF-based approaches, achieving an additional 23.5% runtime reduction via our probability-guided clause filtering strategy. Our results underscore the importance of preserving circuit-level structural insights within SAT solvers, providing a robust foundation for future improvements in SAT-solving efficiency and EDA tool design.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Efficient Data Selection for Training Genomic Perturbation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14571v5)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Genomic studies, including CRISPR-based Perturb-seq analyses, face a vast hypothesis space, while gene perturbations remain costly and time-consuming. Gene perturbation models based on graph neural networks are trained to predict the outcomes of gene perturbations to facilitate such experiments. Due to the cost of genomic experiments, active learning is often employed to train these models, alternating between wet-lab experiments and model updates. However, the operational constraints of the wet-lab and the iterative nature of active learning significantly increase the total training time. Furthermore, the inherent sensitivity to model initialization can lead to markedly different sets of gene perturbations across runs, which undermines the reproducibility, interpretability, and reusability of the method. To this end, we propose a graph-based data filtering method that, unlike active learning, selects the gene perturbations in one shot and in a model-free manner. The method optimizes a criterion that maximizes the supervision signal from the graph neural network to enhance generalization. The criterion is defined over the input graph and is optimized with submodular maximization. We compare it empirically to active learning, and the results demonstrate that despite yielding months of acceleration, it also improves the stability of the selected perturbation experiments while achieving comparable test error.</p></details> | 19 pages |

In many application scenarios, the matrix multiplication takes places on an arbitrary algebraic semiring where the scalar operations are overloaded with user-defined functions with certain properties or a more general heterogenous algebra where even the domains of the input matrices can be different. Here, we provide a unifying treatment of the sparse matrix-matrix operation and its rich application space including machine learning, computational biology and chemistry, graph algorithms, and scientific computing.</p></details> |  |

In addition to users' onsite activities, their offsite conversions are crucial for Ads models to capture their shopping interest. To better leverage offsite conversion data and explore the connection between onsite and offsite activities, we constructed a large-scale heterogeneous graph based on users' onsite ad interactions and opt-in offsite conversion activities. Furthermore, we introduced TransRA (TransR\cite{TransR} with Anchors), a novel Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) model, to more efficiently integrate graph embeddings into Ads ranking models. However, our Ads ranking models initially struggled to directly incorporate Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE), and only modest gains were observed during offline experiments. To address this challenge, we employed the Large ID Embedding Table technique and innovated an attention based KGE finetuning approach within the Ads ranking models. As a result, we observed a significant AUC lift in Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR) prediction models. Moreover, this framework has been deployed in Pinterest's Ads Engagement Model and contributed to $2.69\%$ CTR lift and $1.34\%$ CPC reduction. We believe the techniques presented in this paper can be leveraged by other large-scale industrial models.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we formally introduce and study two query answering problems, namely, query answer classification and query answer retrieval. To solve these problems, we propose AnyCQ, a model that can classify answers to any conjunctive query on any knowledge graph. At the core of our framework lies a graph neural network trained using a reinforcement learning objective to answer Boolean queries. Trained only on simple, small instances, AnyCQ generalizes to large queries of arbitrary structure, reliably classifying and retrieving answers to queries that existing approaches fail to handle. This is empirically validated through our newly proposed, challenging benchmarks. Finally, we empirically show that AnyCQ can effectively transfer to completely novel knowledge graphs when equipped with an appropriate link prediction model, highlighting its potential for querying incomplete data.</p></details> |  |

Current research addresses subgraph-FL from the structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label signals and a degradation in the semantic knowledge of the global GNN. From a spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drift occurs, undermining global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global knowledge repository to mitigate the challenge of poor semantic knowledge caused by label signal disruption. Furthermore, we design a frequency alignment to address spectral client drift. The combination of Spatial and Spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL. The code is available at https://github.com/Wonder7racer/S2FGL.git.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating the Efficacy of Knowledge Distillation from MWPM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03782v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of decoders in Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is key to realizing practical quantum computers. In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach, but their training methodologies are not yet well-established. It is generally expected that transferring theoretical knowledge from classical algorithms like Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) to GNNs, a technique known as knowledge distillation, can effectively improve performance. In this work, we test this hypothesis by rigorously comparing two models based on a Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture that incorporates temporal information as node features. The first is a purely data-driven model (baseline) trained only on ground-truth labels, while the second incorporates a knowledge distillation loss based on the theoretical error probabilities from MWPM. Using public experimental data from Google, our evaluation reveals that while the final test accuracy of the knowledge distillation model was nearly identical to the baseline, its training loss converged more slowly, and the training time increased by a factor of approximately five. This result suggests that modern GNN architectures possess a high capacity to efficiently learn complex error correlations directly from real hardware data, without guidance from approximate theoretical models.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, 1 table.

To tackle these challenges, we present a continual gait recognition task, termed GaitAdapt, which supports the progressive enhancement of gait recognition capabilities over time and is systematically categorized according to various evaluation scenarios. Additionally, we propose GaitAdapter, a non-replay continual learning approach for gait recognition. This approach integrates the GaitPartition Adaptive Knowledge (GPAK) module, employing graph neural networks to aggregate common gait patterns from current data into a repository constructed from graph vectors. Subsequently, this repository is used to improve the discriminability of gait features in new tasks, thereby enhancing the model's ability to effectively recognize gait patterns. We also introduce a Euclidean Distance Stability Method (EDSN) based on negative pairs, which ensures that newly added gait samples from different classes maintain similar relative spatial distributions across both previous and current gait tasks, thereby alleviating the impact of task changes on the distinguishability of original domain features. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that GaitAdapter effectively retains gait knowledge acquired from diverse tasks, exhibiting markedly superior discriminative capability compared to alternative methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterophily-Aware Fair Recommendation using Graph Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03365v4)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a popular tool to improve the accuracy and performance of recommender systems. Modern recommender systems are not only designed to serve end users, but also to benefit other participants, such as items and item providers. These participants may have different or conflicting goals and interests, which raises the need for fairness and popularity bias considerations. GNN-based recommendation methods also face the challenges of unfairness and popularity bias, and their normalization and aggregation processes suffer from these challenges. In this paper, we propose a fair GNN-based recommender system, called HetroFair, to improve item-side fairness. HetroFair uses two separate components to generate fairness-aware embeddings: i) Fairness-aware attention, which incorporates the dot product in the normalization process of GNNs to decrease the effect of nodes' degrees. ii) Heterophily feature weighting, to assign distinct weights to different features during the aggregation process. To evaluate the effectiveness of HetroFair, we conduct extensive experiments over six real-world datasets. Our experimental results reveal that HetroFair not only alleviates unfairness and popularity bias on the item side but also achieves superior accuracy on the user side. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/NematGH/HetroFair.</p></details> |  |

Online Continual Learning (OCL) specifically focuses on learning efficiently from a continuous stream of data with shifting distribution. While recent studies explore Continual Learning on graphs exploiting Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), only few of them focus on a streaming setting. Yet, many real-world graphs evolve over time, often requiring timely and online predictions. Current approaches, however, are not well aligned with the standard OCL setting, partly due to the lack of a clear definition of online Continual Learning on graphs. In this work, we propose a general formulation for online Continual Learning on graphs, emphasizing the efficiency requirements on batch processing over the graph topology, and providing a well-defined setting for systematic model evaluation. Finally, we introduce a set of benchmarks and report the performance of several methods in the CL literature, adapted to our setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

While many existing machine learning approaches have shown promise in brain network analysis, they typically suffer from limited interpretability, particularly in extracting meaningful biomarkers from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and establishing clear relationships between imaging features and demographic characteristics. Besides, current graph neural network methodologies face limitations in capturing both local and global functional connectivity patterns while simultaneously achieving theoretically principled multimodal data fusion. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Information Bottleneck Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (I2B-HGNN), a unified framework that applies information bottleneck principles to guide both brain connectivity modeling and cross-modal feature integration. This framework comprises two complementary components. The first is the Information Bottleneck Graph Transformer (IBGraphFormer), which combines transformer-based global attention mechanisms with graph neural networks through information bottleneck-guided pooling to identify sufficient biomarkers. The second is the Information Bottleneck Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (IB-HGAN), which employs meta-path-based heterogeneous graph learning with structural consistency constraints to achieve interpretable fusion of neuroimaging and demographic data. The experimental results demonstrate that I2B-HGNN achieves superior performance in diagnosing NDDs, exhibiting both high classification accuracy and the ability to provide interpretable biomarker identification while effectively analyzing non-imaging data.</p></details> |  |

A necessary enabler to this capability is to find and track features on a continuous stream of images. Existing methods, such as SIFT, ORB and AKAZE, achieve real-time but inaccurate pose estimates, whereas modern deep learning methods yield higher quality features at the cost of more demanding computational resources which might not be available on space-qualified hardware. Additionally, both classical and data-driven methods are not robust to the highly opaque self-cast shadows on the object of interest. We show that, as the target body rotates, these shadows may lead to large biases in the resulting pose estimates. For these objects, a bias in the real-time pose estimation algorithm may mislead the spacecraft's state estimator and cause a mission failure, especially if the body undergoes a chaotic tumbling motion. We present COFFEE, the Celestial Occlusion Fast FEature Extractor, a real-time pose estimation framework for asteroids designed to leverage prior information on the sun phase angle given by sun-tracking sensors commonly available onboard spacecraft. By associating salient contours to their projected shadows, a sparse set of features are detected, invariant to the motion of the shadows. A Sparse Neural Network followed by an attention-based Graph Neural Network feature matching model are then jointly trained to provide a set of correspondences between successive frames. The resulting pose estimation pipeline is found to be bias-free, more accurate than classical pose estimation pipelines and an order of magnitude faster than other state-of-the-art deep learning pipelines on synthetic data as well as on renderings of the tumbling asteroid Apophis.</p></details> | <details><summary>in Pr...</summary><p>in Proc. 75th Int.

| **[GEDAN: Learning the Edit Costs for Graph Edit Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03111v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Edit Distance (GED) is defined as the minimum cost transformation of one graph into another and is a widely adopted metric for measuring the dissimilarity between graphs. The major problem of GED is that its computation is NP-hard, which has in turn led to the development of various approximation methods, including approaches based on neural networks (NN). Most of these NN-based models simplify the problem of GED by assuming unit-cost edit operations, a rather unrealistic constraint in real-world applications. In this work, we present a novel Graph Neural Network framework that approximates GED using both supervised and unsupervised training. In the unsupervised setting, it employs a gradient-only self-organizing mechanism that enables optimization without ground-truth distances. Moreover, a core component of our architecture is the integration of a Generalized Additive Model, which allows the flexible and interpretable learning of context-aware edit costs. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves similar results as state-of-the-art reference methods, yet significantly improves both adaptability and interpretability. That is, the learned cost function offers insights into complex graph structures, making it particularly valuable in domains such as molecular analysis and structural pattern discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Spectral Graph Neural Networks with LLM-Predicted Homophily](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14220v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) have achieved remarkable performance in tasks such as node classification due to their ability to learn flexible filters. Typically, these filters are learned under the supervision of downstream tasks, enabling SGNNs to adapt to diverse structural patterns. However, in scenarios with limited labeled data, SGNNs often struggle to capture the optimal filter shapes, resulting in degraded performance, especially on graphs with heterophily. Meanwhile, the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities for enhancing graph learning without modifying graph structure or requiring task-specific training. In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages LLMs to estimate the homophily level of a graph and uses this global structural prior to guide the construction of spectral filters. Specifically, we design a lightweight and plug-and-play pipeline where a small set of labeled node pairs is formatted as natural language prompts for the LLM, which then predicts the graph's homophily ratio. This estimated value informs the spectral filter basis, enabling SGNNs to adapt more effectively to both homophilic and heterophilic structures. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our LLM-assisted spectral framework consistently improves performance over strong SGNN baselines. Importantly, this enhancement incurs negligible computational and monetary cost, making it a practical solution for real-world graph applications.</p></details> |  |

We introduce CrystalGRW, a diffusion-based generative model on Riemannian manifolds that proposes novel crystal configurations and can predict stable phases validated by density functional theory. The crystal properties, such as fractional coordinates, atomic types, and lattice matrices, are represented on suitable Riemannian manifolds, ensuring that new predictions generated through the diffusion process preserve the periodicity of crystal structures. We incorporate an equivariant graph neural network to also account for rotational and translational symmetries during the generation process. CrystalGRW demonstrates the ability to generate realistic crystal structures that are close to their ground states with accuracy comparable to existing models, while also enabling conditional control, such as specifying a desired crystallographic point group. These features help accelerate materials discovery and inverse design by offering stable, symmetry-consistent crystal candidates for experimental validation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated results using the model trained on the ALEX-MP-20 dataset. 13+14 pages, 12 figures</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Riemannian Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02600v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph data often exhibits complex geometric heterogeneity, where structures with varying local curvature, such as tree-like hierarchies and dense communities, coexist within a single network. Existing geometric GNNs, which embed graphs into single fixed-curvature manifolds or discrete product spaces, struggle to capture this diversity. We introduce Adaptive Riemannian Graph Neural Networks (ARGNN), a novel framework that learns a continuous and anisotropic Riemannian metric tensor field over the graph. It allows each node to determine its optimal local geometry, enabling the model to fluidly adapt to the graph's structural landscape. Our core innovation is an efficient parameterization of the node-wise metric tensor, specializing to a learnable diagonal form that captures directional geometric information while maintaining computational tractability. To ensure geometric regularity and stable training, we integrate a Ricci flow-inspired regularization that smooths the learned manifold. Theoretically, we establish the rigorous geometric evolution convergence guarantee for ARGNN and provide a continuous generalization that unifies prior fixed or mixed-curvature GNNs. Empirically, our method demonstrates superior performance on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmark datasets with the ability to capture diverse structures adaptively. Moreover, the learned geometries both offer interpretable insights into the underlying graph structure and empirically corroborate our theoretical analysis.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Contextual Graph Transformer: A Small Language Model for Enhanced Engineering Document Information Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02532v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard transformer-based language models, while powerful for general text, often struggle with the fine-grained syntax and entity relationships in complex technical, engineering documents. To address this, we propose the Contextual Graph Transformer (CGT), a hybrid neural architecture that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers for domain-specific question answering. CGT constructs a dynamic graph over input tokens using sequential, skip-gram, and semantic similarity edges, which is processed by GATv2Conv layers for local structure learning. These enriched embeddings are then passed to a Transformer encoder to capture global dependencies. Unlike generic large models, technical domains often require specialized language models with stronger contextualization and structure awareness. CGT offers a parameter-efficient solution for such use cases. Integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, CGT outperforms baselines like GPT-2 and BERT, achieving 24.7% higher accuracy than GPT-2 with 62.4% fewer parameters. This gain stems from CGTs ability to jointly model structural token interactions and long-range semantic coherence. The model is trained from scratch using a two-phase approach: pretraining on general text followed by fine-tuning on domain-specific manuals. This highlights CGTs adaptability to technical language, enabling better grounding, entity tracking, and retrieval-augmented responses in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Structure Sharing Empowers Multi-task Heterogeneous GNNs for Customer Expansion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22089v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Customer expansion, i.e., growing a business existing customer base by acquiring new customers, is critical for scaling operations and sustaining the long-term profitability of logistics companies. Although state-of-the-art works model this task as a single-node classification problem under a heterogeneous graph learning framework and achieve good performance, they struggle with extremely positive label sparsity issues in our scenario. Multi-task learning (MTL) offers a promising solution by introducing a correlated, label-rich task to enhance the label-sparse task prediction through knowledge sharing. However, existing MTL methods result in performance degradation because they fail to discriminate task-shared and task-specific structural patterns across tasks. This issue arises from their limited consideration of the inherently complex structure learning process of heterogeneous graph neural networks, which involves the multi-layer aggregation of multi-type relations. To address the challenge, we propose a Structure-Aware Hierarchical Information Sharing Framework (SrucHIS), which explicitly regulates structural information sharing across tasks in logistics customer expansion. SrucHIS breaks down the structure learning phase into multiple stages and introduces sharing mechanisms at each stage, effectively mitigating the influence of task-specific structural patterns during each stage. We evaluate StrucHIS on both private and public datasets, achieving a 51.41% average precision improvement on the private dataset and a 10.52% macro F1 gain on the public dataset. StrucHIS is further deployed at one of the largest logistics companies in China and demonstrates a 41.67% improvement in the success contract-signing rate over existing strategies, generating over 453K new orders within just two months.</p></details> |  |

Traditional Finite Element Method (FEM)-based simulations, while accurate, are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time scenarios. Learning-based approaches have shown promise in accelerating predictions but have fallen short in modeling soft-rigid interactions effectively. We introduce MIXPINN, a physics-informed Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for mixed-material simulations, explicitly capturing soft-rigid interactions using graph-based augmentations. Our approach integrates Virtual Nodes (VNs) and Virtual Edges (VEs) to enhance rigid body constraint satisfaction while preserving computational efficiency. By leveraging a graph-based representation of biomechanical structures, MIXPINN learns high-fidelity deformations from FEM-generated data and achieves real-time inference with sub-millimeter accuracy. We validate our method in a realistic clinical scenario, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline GNN models and traditional FEM methods. Our results show that MIXPINN reduces computational cost by an order of magnitude while maintaining high physical accuracy, making it a viable solution for real-time surgical simulation and robotic-assisted procedures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025</p></details> |

While traditional network management approaches will suffice, an automated solutions are becoming a must. However, network automation frameworks are prone to errors, and often they employ ML-based techniques that require training to learn how the network can be optimized. In this sense, network digital twins are a useful tool that allows for the simulation, testing, and training of AI models without affecting the real-world networks and users. This paper presents an AI-based Network Digital Twin (AI-NDT) that leverages a multi-layered knowledge graph architecture and graph neural networks to predict network metrics that directly affect the quality of experience of users. An evaluation of the four most prominent Graph Neural Networks (GNN) architectures was conducted to assess their effectiveness in developing network digital twins. We trained the digital twin on publicly available measurement data from RIPE Atlas, therefore obtaining results close to what is expected in real-world applications. The results show that among the four architectures evaluated, GraphTransformer presents the best performance. However, other architectures might fit better in scenarios where shorter training time is important, while also delivering acceptable results. The results of this work are indicative of what might become common practice for proactive network management, offering a scalable and accurate solution aligned with the requirements of the next-generation networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Skeleton-Guided Learning for Shortest Path Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02270v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shortest path search is a core operation in graph-based applications, yet existing methods face important limitations. Classical algorithms such as Dijkstra's and A* become inefficient as graphs grow more complex, while index-based techniques often require substantial preprocessing and storage. Recent learning-based approaches typically focus on spatial graphs and rely on context-specific features like geographic coordinates, limiting their general applicability. We propose a versatile learning-based framework for shortest path search on generic graphs, without requiring domain-specific features. At the core of our approach is the construction of a skeleton graph that captures multi-level distance and hop information in a compact form. A Skeleton Graph Neural Network (SGNN) operates on this structure to learn node embeddings and predict distances and hop lengths between node pairs. These predictions support LSearch, a guided search algorithm that uses model-driven pruning to reduce the search space while preserving accuracy. To handle larger graphs, we introduce a hierarchical training strategy that partitions the graph into subgraphs with individually trained SGNNs. This structure enables HLSearch, an extension of our method for efficient path search across graph partitions. Experiments on five diverse real-world graphs demonstrate that our framework achieves strong performance across graph types, offering a flexible and effective solution for learning-based shortest path search.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional statistical methods struggle with nonlinear effects, while machine learning models often fail to capture geographical (nearby areas being more similar) and topological (unequal connectivity between places) effects in an interpretable way. To address this, we propose MedGNN, a spatio-topologically explicit framework that constructs a 2-hop spatial graph, integrating positional and locational node embeddings with urban characteristics in a graph neural network. Applied to MEDSAT, a comprehensive dataset covering over 150 environmental and socio-demographic factors and six prescription outcomes (depression, anxiety, diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and opioids) across 4,835 Greater London neighborhoods, MedGNN improved predictions by over 25% on average compared to baseline methods. Using depression prescriptions as a case study, we analyzed graph embeddings via geographical principal component analysis, identifying findings that: align with prior research (e.g., higher antidepressant prescriptions among older and White populations), contribute to ongoing debates (e.g., greenery linked to higher and NO2 to lower prescriptions), and warrant further study (e.g., canopy evaporation correlated with fewer prescriptions). These results demonstrate MedGNN's potential, and more broadly, of carefully applied machine learning, to advance transdisciplinary public health research.</p></details> |  |

Although existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers demonstrate strong instance-level modeling capabilities, they encounter constraints regarding scalability and computational expenses. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the WSI-HGMamba, a novel framework that unifies the high-order relational modeling capabilities of the Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) with the linear-time sequential modeling efficiency of the State Space Models. At the core of our design is the HGMamba block, which integrates message passing, hypergraph scanning & flattening, and bidirectional state space modeling (Bi-SSM), enabling the model to retain both relational and contextual cues while remaining computationally efficient. Compared to Transformer and Graph Transformer counterparts, WSI-HGMamba achieves superior performance with up to 7* reduction in FLOPs. Extensive experiments on multiple public and private WSI benchmarks demonstrate that our method provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient solution for slide-level understanding, making it a promising backbone for next-generation pathology AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Network-Based Predictor for Optimal Quantum Hardware Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19093v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing variety of quantum hardware technologies, each with unique peculiarities such as connectivity and native gate sets, creates challenges when selecting the best platform for executing a specific quantum circuit. This selection process usually involves a brute-force approach: compiling the circuit on various devices and evaluating performance based on factors such as circuit depth and gate fidelity. However, this method is computationally expensive and does not scale well as the number of available quantum processors increases. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based predictor that automates hardware selection by analyzing the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) representation of a quantum circuit. Our study evaluates 498 quantum circuits (up to 27 qubits) from the MQT Bench dataset, compiled using Qiskit on four devices: three superconducting quantum processors (IBM-Kyiv, IBM-Brisbane, IBM-Sherbrooke) and one trapped-ion processor (IONQ-Forte). Performance is estimated using a metric that integrates circuit depth and gate fidelity, resulting in a dataset where 93 circuits are optimally compiled on the trapped-ion device, while the remaining circuits prefer superconducting platforms. By exploiting graph-based machine learning, our approach avoids extracting the circuit features for the model evaluation but directly embeds it as a graph, significantly accelerating the optimal target decision-making process and maintaining all the information. Experimental results prove 94.4% accuracy and an 85.5% F1 score for the minority class, effectively predicting the best compilation target. The developed code is publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/antotu/GNN-Model-Quantum-Predictor).</p></details> |  |

Semi-supervised network embedding takes advantage of labeled data, and has shown promising performance. However, existing semi-supervised methods would get unappealing results in the completely-imbalanced label setting where some classes have no labeled nodes at all. To alleviate this, we propose two novel semi-supervised network embedding methods. The first one is a shallow method named RSDNE. Specifically, to benefit from the completely-imbalanced labels, RSDNE guarantees both intra-class similarity and inter-class dissimilarity in an approximate way. The other method is RECT which is a new class of graph neural networks. Different from RSDNE, to benefit from the completely-imbalanced labels, RECT explores the class-semantic knowledge. This enables RECT to handle networks with node features and multi-label setting. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods.

The task involves selecting substation breaker configurations that maximize cross-region power exports, a problem typically formulated as a mixed-integer program (MIP) that is NP-hard and computationally intractable for large networks. OptiGridML replaces repeated MIP solves with a two-stage neural architecture: a line-graph neural network (LGNN) that approximates DC power flows for a given network topology, and a heterogeneous GNN (HeteroGNN) that predicts breaker states under structural and physical constraints. A physics-informed consistency loss connects these components by enforcing Kirchhoff's law on predicted flows. Experiments on synthetic networks with up to 1,000 breakers show that OptiGridML achieves power export improvements of up to 18% over baseline topologies, while reducing inference time from hours to milliseconds. These results demonstrate the potential of structured, flow-aware GNNs for accelerating combinatorial optimization in physical networked systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Binary to Continuous: Stochastic Re-Weighting for Robust Graph Explanation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01925v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable performance in a wide range of graph-related learning tasks. However, explaining their predictions remains a challenging problem, especially due to the mismatch between the graphs used during training and those encountered during explanation. Most existing methods optimize soft edge masks on weighted graphs to highlight important substructures, but these graphs differ from the unweighted graphs on which GNNs are trained. This distributional shift leads to unreliable gradients and degraded explanation quality, especially when generating small, sparse subgraphs. To address this issue, we propose a novel iterative explanation framework which improves explanation robustness by aligning the model's training data distribution with the weighted graph distribution appeared during explanation. Our method alternates between two phases: explanation subgraph identification and model adaptation. It begins with a relatively large explanation subgraph where soft mask optimization is reliable. Based on this subgraph, we assign importance-aware edge weights to explanatory and non-explanatory edges, and retrain the GNN on these weighted graphs. This process is repeated with progressively smaller subgraphs, forming an iterative refinement procedure. We evaluate our method on multiple benchmark datasets using different GNN backbones and explanation methods. Experimental results show that our method consistently improves explanation quality and can be flexibly integrated with different architectures.</p></details> |  |

However, existing studies based on graph neural networks and language models either suffer from the limitations of numerous training needs toward specific downstream predictions, poor generalization, or shallow semantic features. In this work, we propose a novel Path-LLM model to efficiently learn unified graph representation, which leverages a powerful large language model (LLM) to incorporate our proposed path features. Our Path-LLM framework consists of four well-designed techniques. First, we develop a new mechanism of long-to-short shortest path (L2SP) selection, which can cover key connections between different dense groups. An in-depth analysis and comparison of different path selections is conducted to justify the rationale behind our designed L2SP method. Next, we design path textualization to obtain L2SP-based training texts with key phrase selection from node text attributes. We then feed the texts into a self-supervised LLM training process to align next node/edge generation in L2SP with next token generation in causal language modeling for graph representation learning and finally extract the unified graph embeddings. We theoretically analyze the algorithm complexity of our Path-LLM approach. Extensive experiments on large-scale graph benchmarks validate the superiority of Path-LLM against state-of-the-art methods WalkLM, GraphGPT, OFA, and GraphTranslator on two classical graph learning tasks (node classification and edge validation) and one NP-hard graph query processing task (keyword search). Compared with WalkLM, our approach saves more than 90% of training paths on millions-scale graphs and runs at most 35x faster.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12 figures |

The presence of negative-cost cycles renders the problem NP-hard. We present a probabilistic method for finding near-optimal ESPP, enabled by an unsupervised graph neural network that jointly learns node value estimates and edge-selection probabilities via a surrogate loss function. The loss provides a high probability certificate of finding near-optimal ESPP solutions by simultaneously reducing negative-cost cycles and embedding the desired algorithmic alignment. At inference time, a decoding algorithm transforms the learned edge probabilities into an elementary path. Experiments on graphs of up to 100 nodes show that the proposed method surpasses both unsupervised baselines and classical heuristics, while exhibiting high performance in cross-size and cross-topology generalization on unseen synthetic graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gradient Inversion Attack on Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19440v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph federated learning is of essential importance for training over large graph datasets while protecting data privacy, where each client stores a subset of local graph data, while the server collects the local gradients and broadcasts only the aggregated gradients. Recent studies reveal that a malicious attacker can steal private image data from the gradient exchange of neural networks during federated learning. However, the vulnerability of graph data and graph neural networks under such attacks, i.e., reconstructing both node features and graph structure from gradients, remains largely underexplored. To answer this question, this paper studies the problem of whether private data can be reconstructed from leaked gradients in both node classification and graph classification tasks and proposes a novel attack named Graph Leakage from Gradients (GLG). Two widely used GNN frameworks are analyzed, namely GCN and GraphSAGE. The effects of different model settings on reconstruction are extensively discussed. Theoretical analysis and empirical validation demonstrate that, by leveraging the unique properties of graph data and GNNs, GLG achieves more accurate reconstruction of both nodal features and graph structure from gradients.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://openreview.net/forum?id=a0mLrqkWyx</p></details> |
| **[Considering Spatial Structure of the Road Network in Pavement Deterioration Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02749v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pavement deterioration modeling is important in providing information regarding the future state of the road network and in determining the needs of preventive maintenance or rehabilitation treatments. This research incorporated spatial dependence of road network into pavement deterioration modeling through a graph neural network (GNN). The key motivation of using a GNN for pavement performance modeling is the ability to easily and directly exploit the rich structural information in the network. This paper explored if considering spatial structure of the road network will improve the prediction performance of the deterioration models. The data used in this research comprises a large pavement condition data set with more than a half million observations taken from the Pavement Management Information System (PMIS) maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation. The promising comparison results indicates that pavement deterioration prediction models perform better when spatial relationship is considered.</p></details> |  |
| **[A graph neural network based on feature network for identifying influential nodes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01278v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying influential nodes in complex networks is of great importance, and has many applications in practice. For example, finding influential nodes in e-commerce network can provide merchants with customers with strong purchase intent; identifying influential nodes in computer information system can help locating the components that cause the system break down and identifying influential nodes in these networks can accelerate the flow of information in networks. Thus, a lot of efforts have been made on the problem of indentifying influential nodes. However, previous efforts either consider only one aspect of the network structure, or using global centralities with high time consuming as node features to identify influential nodes, and the existing methods do not consider the relationships between different centralities. To solve these problems, we propose a Graph Convolutional Network Framework based on Feature Network, abbreviated as FNGCN (graph convolutional network is abbreviated as GCN in the following text). Further, to exclude noises and reduce redundency, FNGCN utilizes feature network to represent the complicated relationships among the local centralities, based on which the most suitable local centralities are determined. By taking a shallow GCN and a deep GCN into the FNGCN framework, two FNGCNs are developed. With ground truth obtained from the widely used Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) model, the two FNGCNs are compared with the state-of-art methods on several real-world networks. Experimental results show that the two FNGCNs can identify the influential nodes more accurately than the compared methods, indicating that the proposed framework is effective in identifying influential nodes in complex networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[RelMap: Reliable Spatiotemporal Sensor Data Visualization via Imputative Spatial Interpolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01240v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and reliable visualization of spatiotemporal sensor data such as environmental parameters and meteorological conditions is crucial for informed decision-making. Traditional spatial interpolation methods, however, often fall short of producing reliable interpolation results due to the limited and irregular sensor coverage. This paper introduces a novel spatial interpolation pipeline that achieves reliable interpolation results and produces a novel heatmap representation with uncertainty information encoded. We leverage imputation reference data from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance visualization reliability and temporal resolution. By integrating Principal Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA) and Geographical Positional Encoding (GPE), our model effectively learns the spatiotemporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose an extrinsic, static visualization technique for interpolation-based heatmaps that effectively communicates the uncertainties arising from various sources in the interpolated map. Through a set of use cases, extensive evaluations on real-world datasets, and user studies, we demonstrate our model's superior performance for data imputation, the improvements to the interpolant with reference data, and the effectiveness of our visualization design in communicating uncertainties.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 14 figures, paper accepted to IEEE VIS 2025</p></details> |
