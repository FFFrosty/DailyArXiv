| **[Tutorial on the Probabilistic Unification of Estimation Theory, Machine Learning, and Generative AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15719v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extracting meaning from uncertain, noisy data is a fundamental problem across time series analysis, pattern recognition, and language modeling. This survey presents a unified mathematical framework that connects classical estimation theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning, including deep learning and large language models. By analyzing how techniques such as maximum likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, and attention mechanisms address uncertainty, the paper illustrates that many AI methods are rooted in shared probabilistic principles. Through illustrative scenarios including system identification, image classification, and language generation, we show how increasingly complex models build upon these foundations to tackle practical challenges like overfitting, data sparsity, and interpretability. In other words, the work demonstrates that maximum likelihood, MAP estimation, Bayesian classification, and deep learning all represent different facets of a shared goal: inferring hidden causes from noisy and/or biased observations. It serves as both a theoretical synthesis and a practical guide for students and researchers navigating the evolving landscape of machine learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Time-Series Causal Discovery with Approximate Causal Ordering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05500v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery in time-series data presents a significant computational challenge. Standard algorithms are often prohibitively expensive for datasets with many variables or samples. This study introduces and validates a heuristic approximation of the VarLiNGAM algorithm to address this scalability problem. The standard VarLiNGAM method relies on an iterative search, recalculating statistical dependencies after each step. Our heuristic modifies this procedure by omitting the iterative refinement. This change permits a one-time precomputation of all necessary statistical values. The algorithmic modification reduces the time complexity from $O(m^3n)$ to $O(m^2n + m^3)$ while keeping the space complexity at $O(m^2)$, where $m$ is the number of variables and $n$ is the number of samples. While an approximation, our approach retains VarLiNGAM's essential structure and empirical reliability. On large-scale financial data with up to 400 variables, our algorithm achieves a 7--13x speedup over the standard implementation and a 4.5x speedup over a GPU-accelerated version. Evaluations across medical imaging, web server monitoring, and finance demonstrate the heuristic's robustness and practical scalability. This work offers a validated balance between computational efficiency and discovery quality, making large-scale causal analysis feasible on personal computers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph topology estimation of power grids using pairwise mutual information of time series data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11517v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The topology of a power grid is estimated using an information theoretic approach. By modeling the grid as a graph and using voltage magnitude data of individual nodes in the grid, the mutual information between pairs of nodes is computed using different approximation methods. Using the well-known Chow-Liu algorithm, a maximum spanning tree based on mutual information is computed to estimate the power grid topology. This manuscript explores the application of this method to different datasets and explores the domain of applicability. The data quality, precision, time windows, frequency and the method for calculating the mutual information are varied to see the effect on the successful reconstruction of the graph and it's leaf nodes. Success shown for IEEE networks generated with MATPOWER and data generated using GridLAB-D. The algorithm is then cross-validated on IEEE networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI-Powered Machine Learning Approaches for Fault Diagnosis in Industrial Pumps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15550v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a practical approach for early fault detection in industrial pump systems using real-world sensor data from a large-scale vertical centrifugal pump operating in a demanding marine environment. Five key operational parameters were monitored: vibration, temperature, flow rate, pressure, and electrical current. A dual-threshold labeling method was applied, combining fixed engineering limits with adaptive thresholds calculated as the 95th percentile of historical sensor values. To address the rarity of documented failures, synthetic fault signals were injected into the data using domain-specific rules, simulating critical alerts within plausible operating ranges. Three machine learning classifiers - Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - were trained to distinguish between normal operation, early warnings, and critical alerts. Results showed that Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved high accuracy across all classes, including minority cases representing rare or emerging faults, while the SVM model exhibited lower sensitivity to anomalies. Visual analyses, including grouped confusion matrices and time-series plots, indicated that the proposed hybrid method provides robust detection capabilities. The framework is scalable, interpretable, and suitable for real-time industrial deployment, supporting proactive maintenance decisions before failures occur. Furthermore, it can be adapted to other machinery with similar sensor architectures, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for predictive maintenance in complex systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[CC-Time: Cross-Model and Cross-Modality Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12235v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the success of pre-trained language models (PLMs) in various application fields beyond natural language processing, language models have raised emerging attention in the field of time series forecasting (TSF) and have shown great prospects. However, current PLM-based TSF methods still fail to achieve satisfactory prediction accuracy matching the strong sequential modeling power of language models. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Model and Cross-Modality Learning with PLMs for time series forecasting (CC-Time). We explore the potential of PLMs for time series forecasting from two aspects: 1) what time series features could be modeled by PLMs, and 2) whether relying solely on PLMs is sufficient for building time series models. In the first aspect, CC-Time incorporates cross-modality learning to model temporal dependency and channel correlations in the language model from both time series sequences and their corresponding text descriptions. In the second aspect, CC-Time further proposes the cross-model fusion block to adaptively integrate knowledge from the PLMs and time series model to form a more comprehensive modeling of time series patterns. Extensive experiments on nine real-world datasets demonstrate that CC-Time achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy in both full-data training and few-shot learning situations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Adaptable High-throughput Streaming Aggregation Engines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18168v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aggregation queries are a series of computationally-demanding analytics operations on counted, grouped or time series data. They include tasks such as summation or finding the median among the items of the same group, and within a specified number of the last observed tuples for sliding window aggregation (SWAG). They have a wide range of applications including database analytics, operating systems, bank security and medical sensors. Existing challenges include the hardware complexity that comes with efficiently handling per-group states using hash-based approaches. This paper presents an adaptable pipeline for calculating a wide range of aggregation queries with high throughput. It is then adapted for SWAG and achieves up to 476x speedup over the CPU core of the same platform. It achieves unparalleled levels of performance and functionality such as a throughput of 1 GT/s on our setup for SWAG without groups, and more advanced operators with up to 4x the window sizes than the state-of-the-art with groups as an approximation for SWAG featuring per-group windows using a fraction of the resources and no DRAM.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate its efficacy using multiple real-world datasets, showcasing superior performance in accuracy and adaptability compared to reference models. The approach offers valuable insights for strategic decision-making across industries facing financial and marketing forecasting challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE CiFer Companion 2025. 5 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[DiagECG: An LLM-Driven Framework for Diagnostic Reasoning via Discretized ECG Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15338v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task, enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model, DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning-Based Financial Time Series Forecasting via Sliding Window and Variational Mode Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12565v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the complexity of financial time series, this paper proposes a forecasting model combining sliding window and variational mode decomposition (VMD) methods. Historical stock prices and relevant market indicators are used to construct datasets. VMD decomposes non-stationary financial time series into smoother subcomponents, improving model adaptability. The decomposed data is then input into a deep learning model for prediction. The study compares the forecasting effects of an LSTM model trained on VMD-processed sequences with those using raw time series, demonstrating better performance and stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning ECG Representations via Poly-Window Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15225v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is foundational for cardiovascular disease diagnosis, yet the performance of deep learning models is often constrained by limited access to annotated data. Self-supervised contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from unlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG recordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning framework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired by the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages the model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features that persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive experiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate that poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to four times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock pre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we achieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total computation time, making our method practical for training foundational models. Through extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate robustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window contrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated ECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised representation learning in biomedical time-series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication in IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics 2025.

| **[SleepDIFFormer: Sleep Stage Classification via Multivariate Differential Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15215v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classification of sleep stages is essential for assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders such as insomnia. However, manual inspection of EEG characteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error. Although machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively developed, they continue to face challenges from the non-stationarity and variability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) signals, often leading to poor generalization on unseen datasets. This research proposed a Sleep Stage Classification method by developing Multivariate Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) for joint EEG and EOG representation learning. Specifically, SleepDIFFormer was developed to process EEG and EOG signals using our Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) for time series, trained with cross-domain alignment. Our method mitigated spatial and temporal attention noise while learning a domain-invariant joint EEG-EOG representation through feature distribution alignment, thereby enabling generalization to unseen target datasets. Empirically, we evaluated our method on five different sleep staging datasets and compared it with existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted thorough ablation analyses of SleepDIFFormer and interpreted the differential attention weights, highlighting their relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns. These findings have implications for advancing automated sleep stage classification and its application to sleep quality assessment. Our source code is publicly available at https://github.com/Ben1001409/SleepDIFFormer</p></details> | 8 Pages |
| **[On the Performance of Linear Adaptive Filters driven by the Ergodic Chaotic Logistic Map](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15143v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chaotic dynamical systems are increasingly considered for use in coding and transmission systems. This stems from their parameter sensitivity and spectral characteristics. The latter are relevant for channel estimation methods. In particular the logistic map $f_\lambda =\lambda x\left( 1-x\right) $ has been employed in chaotic coding and spread spectrum transmission systems. For $\lambda =4$ the statistical properties of sequences generated by $f_4$ are considered as ideal drive signals for channel estimation schemes. This assumption is proven in the present paper. To this end the higher order statistical moments and the autocorrelation of time series generated by $f_4$ are derived. It is shown that for $\lambda =4$ the zero mean time series is uncorrelated. The adaptation performance of finite impulse response (FIR) digital adaptive filters (DAF) used for channel estimation is analyzed. It is shown that using zero mean sequences of $f_4$ leads to the maximal possible FIR DAF performance. An optimal value for the damping parameter in the LMS scheme is derived that leads to the maximal performance and ensures stability. The analytic considerations are confirmed by simulation results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smart Charging Impact Analysis using Clustering Methods and Real-world Distribution Feeders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15092v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The anticipated widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates a critical evaluation of existing power distribution infrastructures, as EV integration imposes additional stress on distribution networks that can lead to component overloading and power quality degradation. Implementing smart charging mechanisms can mitigate these adverse effects and defer or even avoid upgrades. This study assesses the performance of two smart charging strategies - Time of Use (TOU) pricing and Load Balancing (LB) on seven representative real-world feeders identified using k-means clustering. A time series-based steady-state load flow analysis was conducted on these feeders to simulate the impact of EV charging under both strategies across four different EV enrollment scenarios and three representative days to capture seasonal load characteristics. A grid upgrade strategy has been proposed to strengthen the power grid to support EV integration with minimal cost. Results demonstrate that both TOU and LB strategies effectively manage the additional EV load with reduced upgrade requirement and cost to existing infrastructure compared to the case without smart charging strategies and LB outperforms TOU when the customer enrollment levels are high. These findings support the viability of smart charging in facilitating EV integration while maintaining distribution network reliability and reducing investment cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[TESSERA: Temporal Embeddings of Surface Spectra for Earth Representation and Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20380v4)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satellite remote sensing enables a wide range of downstream applications, including habitat mapping, carbon accounting, and strategies for conservation and sustainable land use. However, satellite time series are voluminous and often corrupted, making them challenging to use. We present TESSERA, an open, global, land-oriented remote sensing foundation model that uses self-supervised learning to generate `ready-to-use' embeddings at 10~m scale from pixel-level satellite time-series data. TESSERA uses two encoders to combine optical data with synthetic aperture radar backscatter coefficients at 10~m resolution to create embeddings that are fused with a multilayer perceptron to create annual global embedding maps. We compare our work with state-of-the-art task-specific models and other foundation models in five diverse downstream tasks and find that TESSERA closely matches or outperforms these baselines. We believe that TESSERA's ease of use, state-of-the-art performance, openness, and computation- and labelled data-efficiency will prove transformative in a wide range of ecological applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Long Short-term Memory with Differentiable Architecture Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14955v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in quantum computing and machine learning have given rise to quantum machine learning (QML), with growing interest in learning from sequential data. Quantum recurrent models like QLSTM are promising for time-series prediction, NLP, and reinforcement learning. However, designing effective variational quantum circuits (VQCs) remains challenging and often task-specific. To address this, we propose DiffQAS-QLSTM, an end-to-end differentiable framework that optimizes both VQC parameters and architecture selection during training. Our results show that DiffQAS-QLSTM consistently outperforms handcrafted baselines, achieving lower loss across diverse test settings. This approach opens the door to scalable and adaptive quantum sequence learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the IEEE International Conference on Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI) 2025</p></details> |

However, a persistent challenge remains the short battery lifetime of such compact sensor edge devices. Integrating artificial intelligence can help overcome this limitation by enabling intelligent real-time decision-making, thereby reducing the energy consumption and prolonging the battery life. However, this remains challenging due to data sparsity and the limited resources of the device restricting the overall model size. In this work, we introduce a multi-task neural network that combines the functionalities of precise self-localization within the gastrointestinal tract with the ability to detect anomalies in the small intestine within a single model. Throughout the development process, we consistently restricted the total number of parameters to ensure the feasibility to deploy such model in a small capsule. We report the first multi-task results using the recently published Galar dataset, integrating established multi-task methods and Viterbi decoding for subsequent time-series analysis. This outperforms current single-task models and represents a significant advance in AI-based approaches in this field. Our model achieves an accuracy of 93.63% on the localization task and an accuracy of 87.48% on the anomaly detection task. The approach requires only 1 million parameters while surpassing the current baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Applications of Medical AI (AMAI workshop) at MICCAI 2025 (submitted version)</p></details> |
| **[A Collusion-Resistance Privacy-Preserving Smart Metering Protocol for Operational Utility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14744v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern grids have adopted advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) to facilitate bidirectional communication between smart meters and control centers. This enables smart meters to report consumption values at predefined intervals to utility providers for purposes including demand balancing, load forecasting, dynamic billing, and operational efficiency. Compared to traditional power grids, smart grids offer advantages such as enhanced reliability, improved energy efficiency, and increased security. However, utility providers can compromise user privacy by analyzing fine-grained readings and extracting individuals' daily activities from this time-series data. To address this concern, we propose a collusion-resistant, privacy-preserving aggregation protocol for smart metering in operational services. Our protocol ensures privacy by leveraging techniques such as partially additive homomorphic encryption, aggregation, data perturbation, and data minimization. The scheme aggregates perturbed readings using the additive homomorphic property of the Paillier cryptosystem to provide results for multiple operational purposes. We evaluate the protocol in terms of both performance and privacy. Computational, memory, and communication overhead were examined. The total execution time with 1024-bit key size is about 2.21 seconds. We also evaluated privacy through the normalized conditional entropy (NCE) metric. Higher NCE values, closer to 1, indicate stronger privacy. By increasing noise scale, the NCE value rises, showing perturbed values retain minimal information about the original, thereby reducing risks. Overall, evaluation demonstrates the protocol's efficiency while employing various privacy-preserving techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[ELATE: Evolutionary Language model for Automated Time-series Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14667v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series prediction involves forecasting future values using machine learning models. Feature engineering, whereby existing features are transformed to make new ones, is critical for enhancing model performance, but is often manual and time-intensive. Existing automation attempts rely on exhaustive enumeration, which can be computationally costly and lacks domain-specific insights. We introduce ELATE (Evolutionary Language model for Automated Time-series Engineering), which leverages a language model within an evolutionary framework to automate feature engineering for time-series data. ELATE employs time-series statistical measures and feature importance metrics to guide and prune features, while the language model proposes new, contextually relevant feature transformations. Our experiments demonstrate that ELATE improves forecasting accuracy by an average of 8.4% across various domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Simulation of extreme functionals in meteoceanic data: Application to surge evolution over tidal cycles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13687v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the influence of time-varying meteoceanic conditions on coastal flooding under the prism of rare events. Focusing on conditions observed over half tidal cycles, we observe that such data fall within the framework of functional extreme value theory, but violate standard assumptions due to temporal dependence and short-tailed behavior.a To address this, we propose a two-stage methodology. First, we introduce an autoregressive model to eliminate temporal dependence between cycles. Second, considering the model residuals, we adapt existing techniques based on Pareto processes. This allows us to build a simulator of extreme scenarios, by applying inverse transformations. These simulations depend on an initial time series, which can be randomly selected to tune the desired level of extremes. We validate the simulator performance by comparing simulated times series with observations, through several criteria, based on principal component analysis, extreme value analysis, and classification algorithms. The approach is applied to the surge data, on the G{\^a}vres site, located in southern Brittany, France.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Pre-Trained Time Series Models for Electricity Price Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08113v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate electricity price forecasting (EPF) is crucial for effective decision-making in power trading on the spot market. While recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have inspired the development of numerous time series foundation models (TSFMs) for time series forecasting, their effectiveness in EPF remains uncertain. To address this gap, we benchmark several state-of-the-art pretrained models--Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-T5, TimesFM, Moirai, Time-MoE, and TimeGPT--against established statistical and machine learning (ML) methods for EPF. Using 2024 day-ahead auction (DAA) electricity prices from Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria, and Belgium, we generate daily forecasts with a one-day horizon. Chronos-Bolt and Time-MoE emerge as the strongest among the TSFMs, performing on par with traditional models. However, the biseasonal MSTL model, which captures daily and weekly seasonality, stands out for its consistent performance across countries and evaluation metrics, with no TSFM statistically outperforming it.</p></details> |  |
| **[Artificial Intelligence-Based Multiscale Temporal Modeling for Anomaly Detection in Cloud Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14503v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study proposes an anomaly detection method based on the Transformer architecture with integrated multiscale feature perception, aiming to address the limitations of temporal modeling and scale-aware feature representation in cloud service environments. The method first employs an improved Transformer module to perform temporal modeling on high-dimensional monitoring data, using a self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies and contextual semantics. Then, a multiscale feature construction path is introduced to extract temporal features at different granularities through downsampling and parallel encoding. An attention-weighted fusion module is designed to dynamically adjust the contribution of each scale to the final decision, enhancing the model's robustness in anomaly pattern modeling. In the input modeling stage, standardized multidimensional time series are constructed, covering core signals such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and task scheduling states, while positional encoding is used to strengthen the model's temporal awareness. A systematic experimental setup is designed to evaluate performance, including comparative experiments and hyperparameter sensitivity analysis, focusing on the impact of optimizers, learning rates, anomaly ratios, and noise levels. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms mainstream baseline models in key metrics, including precision, recall, AUC, and F1-score, and maintains strong stability and detection performance under various perturbation conditions, demonstrating its superior capability in complex cloud environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Organ-Agents: Virtual Human Physiology Simulator via LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14357v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled new possibilities in simulating complex physiological systems. We introduce Organ-Agents, a multi-agent framework that simulates human physiology via LLM-driven agents. Each Simulator models a specific system (e.g., cardiovascular, renal, immune). Training consists of supervised fine-tuning on system-specific time-series data, followed by reinforcement-guided coordination using dynamic reference selection and error correction. We curated data from 7,134 sepsis patients and 7,895 controls, generating high-resolution trajectories across 9 systems and 125 variables. Organ-Agents achieved high simulation accuracy on 4,509 held-out patients, with per-system MSEs <0.16 and robustness across SOFA-based severity strata. External validation on 22,689 ICU patients from two hospitals showed moderate degradation under distribution shifts with stable simulation. Organ-Agents faithfully reproduces critical multi-system events (e.g., hypotension, hyperlactatemia, hypoxemia) with coherent timing and phase progression. Evaluation by 15 critical care physicians confirmed realism and physiological plausibility (mean Likert ratings 3.9 and 3.7). Organ-Agents also enables counterfactual simulations under alternative sepsis treatment strategies, generating trajectories and APACHE II scores aligned with matched real-world patients. In downstream early warning tasks, classifiers trained on synthetic data showed minimal AUROC drops (<0.04), indicating preserved decision-relevant patterns. These results position Organ-Agents as a credible, interpretable, and generalizable digital twin for precision diagnosis, treatment simulation, and hypothesis testing in critical care.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Autoregressive Switching Processes with Cumulative Shrinkage Priors for Graphical Modeling of Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03385v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a flexible Bayesian approach for sparse Gaussian graphical modeling of multivariate time series. We account for temporal correlation in the data by assuming that observations are characterized by an underlying and unobserved hidden discrete autoregressive process. We assume multivariate Gaussian emission distributions and capture spatial dependencies by modeling the state-specific precision matrices via graphical horseshoe priors. We characterize the mixing probabilities of the hidden process via a cumulative shrinkage prior that accommodates zero-inflated parameters for non-active components, and further incorporate a sparsity-inducing Dirichlet prior to estimate the effective number of states from the data. For posterior inference, we develop a sampling procedure that allows estimation of the number of discrete autoregressive lags and the number of states, and that cleverly avoids having to deal with the changing dimensions of the parameter space. We thoroughly investigate performance of our proposed methodology through several simulation studies. We further illustrate the use of our approach for the estimation of dynamic brain connectivity based on fMRI data collected on a subject performing a task-based experiment on latent learning</p></details> |  |
| **[Structured Agentic Workflows for Financial Time-Series Modeling with LLMs and Reflective Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13915v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series data is central to decision-making in financial markets, yet building high-performing, interpretable, and auditable models remains a major challenge. While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline model development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to domain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory management, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible workflow automation. In this paper, we introduce \textsf{TS-Agent}, a modular agentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling workflows for financial applications. The agent formalizes the pipeline as a structured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection, code refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and experimental feedback. Central to our architecture is a planner agent equipped with structured knowledge banks, curated libraries of models and refinement strategies, which guide exploration, while improving interpretability and reducing error propagation. \textsf{TS-Agent} supports adaptive learning, robust debugging, and transparent auditing, key requirements for high-stakes environments such as financial services. Empirical evaluations on diverse financial forecasting and synthetic data generation tasks demonstrate that \textsf{TS-Agent} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic baselines, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and decision traceability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Energy-Aware Time-Series Model Deployment on Embedded FPGAs for Resilient Combined Sewer Overflow Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13905v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extreme weather events, intensified by climate change, increasingly challenge aging combined sewer systems, raising the risk of untreated wastewater overflow. Accurate forecasting of sewer overflow basin filling levels can provide actionable insights for early intervention, helping mitigating uncontrolled discharge. In recent years, AI-based forecasting methods have offered scalable alternatives to traditional physics-based models, but their reliance on cloud computing limits their reliability during communication outages. To address this, we propose an end-to-end forecasting framework that enables energy-efficient inference directly on edge devices. Our solution integrates lightweight Transformer and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, compressed via integer-only quantization for efficient on-device execution. Moreover, an automated hardware-aware deployment pipeline is used to search for optimal model configurations by jointly minimizing prediction error and energy consumption on an AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 FPGA. Evaluated on real-world sewer data, the selected 8-bit Transformer model, trained on 24 hours of historical measurements, achieves high accuracy (MSE 0.0376) at an energy cost of 0.370 mJ per inference. In contrast, the optimal 8-bit LSTM model requires significantly less energy (0.009 mJ, over 40x lower) but yields 14.89% worse accuracy (MSE 0.0432) and much longer training time. This trade-off highlights the need to align model selection with deployment priorities, favoring LSTM for ultra-low energy consumption or Transformer for higher predictive accuracy. In general, our work enables local, energy-efficient forecasting, contributing to more resilient combined sewer systems.

In this survey, we first systematically evaluate five storage architectures (Graph Databases, Multi-Model Databases, Data Lakes, Vector Databases, and Time-Series Databases), focusing on their suitability for addressing EAI's core requirements, including physical grounding, low-latency access, and dynamic scalability. We then analyze five retrieval paradigms (Fusion Strategy-Based Retrieval, Representation Alignment-Based Retrieval, Graph-Structure-Based Retrieval, Generation Model-Based Retrieval, and Efficient Retrieval-Based Optimization), revealing a fundamental tension between achieving long-term semantic coherence and maintaining real-time responsiveness. Based on this comprehensive analysis, we identify key bottlenecks, spanning from the foundational Physical Grounding Gap to systemic challenges in cross-modal integration, dynamic adaptation, and open-world generalization. Finally, we outline a forward-looking research agenda encompassing physics-aware data models, adaptive storage-retrieval co-optimization, and standardized benchmarking, to guide future research toward principled data management solutions for EAI. Our survey is based on a comprehensive review of more than 180 related studies, providing a rigorous roadmap for designing the robust, high-performance data management frameworks essential for the next generation of autonomous embodied systems.</p></details> |  |

We consider a variant, where given a set of trajectories and a number of parts, we jointly partition the set of trajectories and learn linear dynamical system (LDS) models for each part, so as to minimize the maximum error across all the models. We present globally convergent methods and EM heuristics, accompanied by promising computational results. The key highlight of this method is that it does not require a predefined hidden state dimension but instead provides an upper bound. Additionally, it offers guidance for determining regularization in the system identification.</p></details> |  |

However, current DDPM-based probabilistic time series imputation methodologies are confronted with two types of challenges: 1)\textit{The backbone modules of the denoising parts are not capable of achieving sequence modeling with low time complexity.} 2)~\textit{The architecture of denoising modules can not handle the dependencies in the time series data effectively.} To address the first challenge, we explore the potential of state space model, namely Mamba, as the backbone denoising module for DDPMs. To tackle the second challenge, we carefully devise several SSM-based blocks for time series data modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art time series imputation results on multiple real-world datasets.

| **[On the reconstruction limits of complex networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01437v3)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network reconstruction consists in retrieving the hidden interaction structure of a system from observations. Many reconstruction algorithms have been proposed, although less research has been devoted to describe their theoretical limitations. In this work, we take a first-principles approach and build on our earlier definition of reconstructability-the fraction of structural information recoverable from data. We relate this quantity to the true data-generating (TDG) process and delineate an information-theoretic reconstruction limit, i.e., the upper bound of the mutual information between the true underlying graph and any graph reconstructed from observations. These concepts lead us to a principled numerical method to assess the validity of empirically reconstructed networks, based on model selection and a quantity we introduce: the reconstruction index. This index approximates the reconstructability from data, quantifies the variability of the reconstructed network ensemble, and is shown to predict reconstruction error without requiring knowledge of the true underlying network. We characterize this method and test it on empirical time series and networks.</p></details> |  |

Although Transformer-based models have made significant breakthroughs in forecasting, their effectiveness for time series forecasting remains debatable. In this paper, we revisit the significance of self-attention and propose a simple yet effective mechanism, Periodic-Nested Group Attention, namely PENGUIN. Our approach highlights the importance of explicitly modeling periodic patterns and incorporating relative attention bias for effective time series modeling. To this end, we introduce a periodic-nested relative attention bias that captures periodic structures directly. To handle multiple coexisting periodicities (e.g., daily and weekly cycles), we design a grouped attention mechanism, where each group targets a specific periodicity using a multi-query attention mechanism. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that PENGUIN consistently outperforms both MLP-based and Transformer-based models.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlowState: Sampling Rate Invariant Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05287v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) have transformed natural language processing, but their success has not yet translated to time series forecasting. Existing time series foundation models (TSFMs), often based on transformer variants, struggle with generalization across varying context and target lengths, lack adaptability to different sampling rates, and are computationally inefficient. We introduce FlowState, a novel TSFM architecture that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: a state space model (SSM) based encoder and a functional basis decoder. This design enables continuous-time modeling and dynamic time-scale adjustment, allowing FlowState to inherently generalize across all possible temporal resolutions, and dynamically adjust the forecasting horizons. In contrast to other state-of-the-art TSFMs, which require training data across all possible sampling rates to memorize patterns at each scale, FlowState inherently adapts its internal dynamics to the input scale, enabling smaller models, reduced data requirements, and improved efficiency. We further propose an efficient pretraining strategy that improves robustness and accelerates training. Despite being the smallest model, FlowState outperforms all other models and is state-of-the-art for the GIFT-ZS and the Chronos-ZS benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of its components, and we demonstrate its unique ability to adapt online to varying input sampling rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review</p></details> |
| **[ERIS: An Energy-Guided Feature Disentanglement Framework for Out-of-Distribution Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14134v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An ideal time series classification (TSC) should be able to capture invariant representations, but achieving reliable performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) data remains a core obstacle. This obstacle arises from the way models inherently entangle domain-specific and label-relevant features, resulting in spurious correlations. While feature disentanglement aims to solve this, current methods are largely unguided, lacking the semantic direction required to isolate truly universal features. To address this, we propose an end-to-end Energy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (\textbf{ERIS}) framework to enable guided and reliable feature disentanglement. The core idea is that effective disentanglement requires not only mathematical constraints but also semantic guidance to anchor the separation process. ERIS incorporates three key mechanisms to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first introduce an energy-guided calibration mechanism, which provides crucial semantic guidance for the separation, enabling the model to self-calibrate. Additionally, a weight-level orthogonality strategy enforces structural independence between domain-specific and label-relevant features, thereby mitigating their interference. Moreover, an auxiliary adversarial training mechanism enhances robustness by injecting structured perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that ERIS improves upon state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 4.04% accuracy across four benchmarks.</p></details> | conference |
| **[HRS: Hybrid Representation Framework with Scheduling Awareness for Time Series Forecasting in Crowdsourced Cloud-Edge Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12839v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid proliferation of streaming services, network load exhibits highly time-varying and bursty behavior, posing serious challenges for maintaining Quality of Service (QoS) in Crowdsourced Cloud-Edge Platforms (CCPs). While CCPs leverage Predict-then-Schedule architecture to improve QoS and profitability, accurate load forecasting remains challenging under traffic surges. Existing methods either minimize mean absolute error, resulting in underprovisioning and potential Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations during peak periods, or adopt conservative overprovisioning strategies, which mitigate SLA risks at the expense of increased resource expenditure. To address this dilemma, we propose HRS, a hybrid representation framework with scheduling awareness that integrates numerical and image-based representations to better capture extreme load dynamics. We further introduce a Scheduling-Aware Loss (SAL) that captures the asymmetric impact of prediction errors, guiding predictions that better support scheduling decisions. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that HRS consistently outperforms ten baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing SLA violation rates by 63.1% and total profit loss by 32.3%.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 14 figures, ECAI2025</p></details> |
| **[Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing with Visibility Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19046v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of complex and nonlinear time series remains a challenging problem across engineering and scientific disciplines. Reservoir computing (RC) offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional deep learning by training only the read-out layer while employing a randomly structured and fixed reservoir network. Despite its advantages, the largely random reservoir graph architecture often results in suboptimal and oversized networks with poorly understood dynamics. Addressing this issue, we propose a novel Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing (DyRC) framework that systematically infers the reservoir network structure directly from the input training sequence. This work proposes to employ the visibility graph (VG) technique, which converts time series data into networks by representing measurement points as nodes linked by mutual visibility. The reservoir network is constructed by directly adopting the VG network from a training data sequence, leveraging the parameter-free visibility graph approach to avoid expensive hyperparameter tuning. This process results in a reservoir that is directly informed by the specific dynamics of the prediction task under study. We assess the DyRC-VG method through prediction tasks involving the canonical nonlinear Duffing oscillator, evaluating prediction accuracy and consistency. Compared to an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (ER) graph of the same size, spectral radius, and fixed density, we observe higher prediction quality and more consistent performance over repeated implementations in the DyRC-VG. An ER graph with density matched to the DyRC-VG can in some conditions outperform both approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures.

Accurate demographic forecasting is essential for informed decision-making in areas such as urban planning, healthcare, and economic policy. This study explores the application of time series foundation models to predict demographic changes in the United States using datasets from the U.S. Census Bureau and Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). We evaluate the performance of the Time Series Foundation Model (TimesFM) against traditional baselines including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Linear Regression. Our experiments across six demographically diverse states demonstrate that TimesFM achieves the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) in 86.67% of test cases, with particularly strong performance on minority populations with sparse historical data. These findings highlight the potential of pre-trained foundation models to enhance demographic analysis and inform proactive policy interventions without requiring extensive task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Conditionally specified graphical modeling of stationary multivariate time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13572v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical models are ubiquitous for summarizing conditional relations in multivariate data. In many applications involving multivariate time series, it is of interest to learn an interaction graph that treats each individual time series as nodes of the graph, with the presence of an edge between two nodes signifying conditional dependence given the others. Typically, the partial covariance is used as a measure of conditional dependence. However, in many applications, the outcomes may not be Gaussian and/or could be a mixture of different outcomes. For such time series using the partial covariance as a measure of conditional dependence may be restrictive. In this article, we propose a broad class of time series models which are specifically designed to succinctly encode process-wide conditional independence in its parameters. For each univariate component in the time series, we model its conditional distribution with a distribution from the exponential family. We develop a notion of process-wide compatibility under which such conditional specifications can be stitched together to form a well-defined strictly stationary multivariate time series. We call this construction a conditionally exponential stationary graphical model ({\it CEStGM}). A central quantity underlying CEStGM is a positive kernel which we call the interaction kernel. Spectral properties of such positive kernel operators constitute a core technical foundation of this work. We establish process-wide local and global Markov properties of CEStGM exploiting a Hammersley-Clifford type decomposition of the interaction kernel. Further, we study various probabilistic properties of CEStGM and show that it is geometrically mixing. An approximate Gibbs sampler is also developed to simulate sample paths of CEStGM.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedKGent: A Large Language Model Agent Framework for Constructing Temporally Evolving Medical Knowledge Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12393v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of medical literature presents growing challenges for structuring and integrating domain knowledge at scale. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a promising solution by enabling efficient retrieval, automated reasoning, and knowledge discovery. However, current KG construction methods often rely on supervised pipelines with limited generalizability or naively aggregate outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs), treating biomedical corpora as static and ignoring the temporal dynamics and contextual uncertainty of evolving knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce MedKGent, a LLM agent framework for constructing temporally evolving medical KGs. Leveraging over 10 million PubMed abstracts published between 1975 and 2023, we simulate the emergence of biomedical knowledge via a fine-grained daily time series. MedKGent incrementally builds the KG in a day-by-day manner using two specialized agents powered by the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model. The Extractor Agent identifies knowledge triples and assigns confidence scores via sampling-based estimation, which are used to filter low-confidence extractions and inform downstream processing. The Constructor Agent incrementally integrates the retained triples into a temporally evolving graph, guided by confidence scores and timestamps to reinforce recurring knowledge and resolve conflicts. The resulting KG contains 156,275 entities and 2,971,384 relational triples. Quality assessments by two SOTA LLMs and three domain experts demonstrate an accuracy approaching 90%, with strong inter-rater agreement. To evaluate downstream utility, we conduct RAG across seven medical question answering benchmarks using five leading LLMs, consistently observing significant improvements over non-augmented baselines. Case studies further demonstrate the KG's value in literature-based drug repurposing via confidence-aware causal inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simultaneous inference for monotone and smoothly time-varying functions under complex temporal dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02177v4)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new framework for the simultaneous inference of monotone and smoothly time-varying functions under complex temporal dynamics. This will be done utilizing the monotone rearrangement and the nonparametric estimation. We capitalize the Gaussian approximation for the nonparametric monotone estimator and construct the asymptotically correct simultaneous confidence bands (SCBs) using designed bootstrap methods. We investigate two general and practical scenarios. The first is the simultaneous inference of monotone smooth trends from moderately high-dimensional time series. The proposed algorithm has been employed for the joint inference of temperature curves from multiple areas. Specifically, most existing methods are designed for a single monotone smooth trend. In such cases, our proposed SCB empirically exhibits the narrowest width among existing approaches while maintaining confidence levels. It has also been used for testing several hypotheses tailored to global warming. The second scenario involves simultaneous inference of monotone and smoothly time-varying regression coefficients in time-varying coefficient linear models. The proposed algorithm has been utilized for testing the impact of sunshine duration on temperature which is believed to be increasing due to severe greenhouse effect. The validity of the proposed methods has been justified in theory as well as by extensive simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[DualSG: A Dual-Stream Explicit Semantic-Guided Multivariate Time Series Forecasting Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21830v3)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Forecasting plays a key role in many applications. Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively, methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs, rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation. Experiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value of explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ACM Multimedia 2025 (ACM MM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[EventTSF: Event-Aware Non-Stationary Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13434v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a vital role in critical domains like energy and transportation, where non-stationary dynamics are deeply intertwined with events in other modalities such as texts. However, incorporating natural language-based external events to improve non-stationary forecasting remains largely unexplored, as most approaches still rely on a single modality, resulting in limited contextual knowledge and model underperformance. Enabling fine-grained multimodal interactions between temporal and textual data is challenged by three fundamental issues: (1) the difficulty of fine-grained synchronization between time-varying discrete textual events and continuous time series; (2) the inherent temporal uncertainty introduced by textual semantics; and (3) the misalignment between textual event embeddings and multi-resolution temporal patterns. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF), an autoregressive generation framework that integrates historical time series with textual events to make subsequent forecasts. Specifically, EventTSF uses autoregressive diffusion with flow matching at each step to capture nuanced temporal-event interactions. To handle event-induced uncertainty, flow matching timesteps are adaptively controlled according to event semantic signals. The underlying denoiser employs a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer that efficiently fuses temporal and textual modalities across different resolutions. Extensive experiments on 8 synthetic and real-world datasets show that EventTSF outperforms 12 baselines across diverse event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting scenarios, achieving substantial improvements of 10.7% higher forecasting accuracy and $1.13\times$ faster training efficiency.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Identification and Estimation of Multi-order Tensor Factor Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13418v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework in high-dimensional factor models to simultaneously analyze multiple tensor time series, each with potentially different tensor orders and dimensionality. The connection between different tensor time series is through their global factors that are correlated to each other. A salient feature of our model is that when all tensor time series have the same order, it can be regarded as an extension of multilevel factor models from vectors to general tensors. Under very mild conditions, we separate the global and local components in the proposed model. Parameter estimation is thoroughly discussed. With strong correlation between global factors and noise allowed, we derive the rates of convergence of our estimators, which can be more superior than those of existing methods for multilevel factor models. We also develop estimators that are more computationally efficient, with rates of convergence spelt out. Extensive experiments are performed under various settings, corroborating with the pronounced theoretical results. As a real application example, we analyze a set of taxi data to study the traffic flow between Times Squares and its neighboring areas.</p></details> | 47 pages, 3 figures |

In this work, we propose a new multimodal approach that integrates longitudinal diagnosis code histories and routinely collected laboratory measurements from electronic health records to detect PDAC up to one year prior to clinical diagnosis. Our method combines neural controlled differential equations to model irregular lab time series, pretrained language models and recurrent networks to learn diagnosis code trajectory representations, and cross-attention mechanisms to capture interactions between the two modalities. We develop and evaluate our approach on a real-world dataset of nearly 4,700 patients and achieve significant improvements in AUC ranging from 6.5% to 15.5% over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our model identifies diagnosis codes and laboratory panels associated with elevated PDAC risk, including both established and new biomarkers.

| **[A Cost-Effective Framework for Predicting Parking Availability Using Geospatial Data and Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14125v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As urban populations continue to grow, cities face numerous challenges in managing parking and determining occupancy. This issue is particularly pronounced in university campuses, where students need to find vacant parking spots quickly and conveniently during class timings. The limited availability of parking spaces on campuses underscores the necessity of implementing efficient systems to allocate vacant parking spots effectively. We propose a smart framework that integrates multiple data sources, including street maps, mobility, and meteorological data, through a spatial join operation to capture parking behavior and vehicle movement patterns over the span of 3 consecutive days with an hourly duration between 7AM till 3PM. The system will not require any sensing tools to be installed in the street or in the parking area to provide its services since all the data needed will be collected using location services. The framework will use the expected parking entrance and time to specify a suitable parking area. Several forecasting models, namely, Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are evaluated. Hyperparameter tuning was employed using grid search, and model performance is assessed using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Coefficient of Determination (R2). Random Forest Regression achieved the lowest RMSE of 0.142 and highest R2 of 0.582. However, given the time-series nature of the task, an LSTM model may perform better with additional data and longer timesteps.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often rely on point estimates or purely data-driven models, which tend to falter under data scarcity. We propose a time series diffusion-based framework that incorporates guidance from imperfect expert models by extracting high-level signals to serve as structured priors for generative modeling. Our method, ODE-Diff, bridges mechanistic and data-driven approaches, enabling more reliable and interpretable causal inference. We evaluate ODE-Diff across semi-synthetic COVID-19 simulations, synthetic pharmacological dynamics, and real-world case studies, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms strong baselines in both point prediction and distributional accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Shrinkage in High-Dimensional VAR Models: A Comparative Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05489v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional vector autoregressive (VAR) models offer a versatile framework for multivariate time series analysis, yet face critical challenges from over-parameterization and uncertain lag order. In this paper, we systematically compare three Bayesian shrinkage priors (horseshoe, lasso, and normal) and two frequentist regularization approaches (ridge and nonparametric shrinkage) under three carefully crafted simulation scenarios. These scenarios encompass (i) overfitting in a low-dimensional setting, (ii) sparse high-dimensional processes, and (iii) a combined scenario where both large dimension and overfitting complicate inference. We evaluate each method in quality of parameter estimation (root mean squared error, coverage, and interval length) and out-of-sample forecasting (one-step-ahead forecast RMSE). Our findings show that local-global Bayesian methods, particularly the horseshoe, dominate in maintaining accurate coverage and minimizing parameter error, even when the model is heavily over-parameterized. Frequentist ridge often yields competitive point forecasts but underestimates uncertainty, leading to sub-nominal coverage. A real-data application using macroeconomic variables from Canada illustrates how these methods perform in practice, reinforcing the advantages of local-global priors in stabilizing inference when dimension or lag order is inflated.</p></details> |  |

This work aims to showcase modern data-driven farming practices based on explainable machine learning(ML) methods that explain the activity and behaviour of dairy cattle (cows). Continuous data collection of 3-axis accelerometer sensors and usage of robust ML methodologies and algorithms, provide farmers and researchers with actionable information on cattle activity, allowing farmers to make informed decisions and incorporate sustainable practices. This study utilizes Bluetooth-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices and 4G networks for seamless data transmission, immediate analysis, inference generation, and explains the models performance with explainability frameworks. Special emphasis is put on the pre-processing of the accelerometers time series data, including the extraction of statistical characteristics, signal processing techniques, and lag-based features using the sliding window technique. Various hyperparameter-optimized ML models are evaluated across varying window lengths for activity classification. The k-nearest neighbour Classifier achieved the best performance, with AUC of mean 0.98 and standard deviation of 0.0026 on the training set and 0.99 on testing set). In order to ensure transparency, Explainable AI based frameworks such as SHAP is used to interpret feature importance that can be understood and used by practitioners. A detailed comparison of the important features, along with the stability analysis of selected features, supports development of explainable and practical ML models for sustainable livestock management.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causally-Guided Pairwise Transformer -- Towards Foundational Digital Twins in Process Industry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13111v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundational modelling of multi-dimensional time-series data in industrial systems presents a central trade-off: channel-dependent (CD) models capture specific cross-variable dynamics but lack robustness and adaptability as model layers are commonly bound to the data dimensionality of the tackled use-case, while channel-independent (CI) models offer generality at the cost of modelling the explicit interactions crucial for system-level predictive regression tasks. To resolve this, we propose the Causally-Guided Pairwise Transformer (CGPT), a novel architecture that integrates a known causal graph as an inductive bias. The core of CGPT is built around a pairwise modeling paradigm, tackling the CD/CI conflict by decomposing the multidimensional data into pairs. The model uses channel-agnostic learnable layers where all parameter dimensions are independent of the number of variables. CGPT enforces a CD information flow at the pair-level and CI-like generalization across pairs. This approach disentangles complex system dynamics and results in a highly flexible architecture that ensures scalability and any-variate adaptability.

Results demonstrate that CGPT significantly outperforms both CI and CD baselines in predictive accuracy and shows competitive performance with end-to-end trained CD models while remaining agnostic to the problem dimensionality.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Evaluation Function (HEF): A Multi-Metric Approach for Optimizing Demand Forecasting Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13057v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Demand forecasting is essential for strategic planning in competitive environments, enabling resource optimization and improved responsiveness to market dynamics. However, multivariate time series modeling faces challenges due to data complexity, uncertainty, and frequent regime shifts. Traditional evaluation metrics can introduce biases and limit generalization. This work compares two custom evaluation functions: FMAE (Focused Mean Absolute Error), focused on minimizing absolute errors, and HEF (Hierarchical Evaluation Function), designed to weight global metrics and penalize large deviations. Experiments were conducted under different data splits (91:9, 80:20, 70:30) using three optimizers (Grid Search, PSO, Optuna), assessing fit, relative accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Results show that HEF consistently outperforms FMAE in global metrics (R2, Relative Accuracy, RMSE, RMSSE), enhancing model robustness and explanatory power. These findings were confirmed via visualizations and statistical tests. Conversely, FMAE offers advantages in local metrics (MAE, MASE) and execution time, making it suitable for short-term scenarios. The study highlights a methodological trade-off: HEF is ideal for strategic planning, while FMAE is better suited for operational efficiency. A replicable framework is proposed for optimizing predictive models in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 15 figures, 110 tables.

This survey provides a comprehensive examination of spectral methods from classical Fourier analysis to modern neural operators, systematically summarizing three open challenges in current research: (1) causal structure preservation during spectral transformations, (2) uncertainty quantification in learned frequency representations, and (3) topology-aware analysis for non-Euclidean data structures. Through rigorous reviewing of over 100 studies, we develop a unified taxonomy that bridges conventional spectral techniques with cutting-edge machine learning approaches, while establishing standardized benchmarks for performance evaluation. Our work identifies key knowledge gaps in the field, particularly in geometric deep learning and quantum-enhanced spectral analysis. The survey offers practitioners a systematic framework for method selection and implementation, while charting promising directions for future research in this rapidly evolving domain.</p></details> | 35 pages |

| **[A self-supervised learning approach for denoising autoregressive models with additive noise: finite and infinite variance cases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12970v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The autoregressive time series model is a popular second-order stationary process, modeling a wide range of real phenomena. However, in applications, autoregressive signals are often corrupted by additive noise. Further, the autoregressive process and the corruptive noise may be highly impulsive, stemming from an infinite-variance distribution. The model estimation techniques that account for additional noise tend to show reduced efficacy when there is very strong noise present in the data, especially when the noise is heavy-tailed. Moreover, identification of a model corrupted with heavy-tailed, particularly infinite-variance noise, can be a very challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised learning method to denoise the additive noise-corrupted autoregressive model. Our approach is motivated by recent work in computer vision and does not require full knowledge of the noise distribution. We use the proposed method to recover exemplary finite- and infinite-variance autoregressive signals, namely, Gaussian- and alpha-stable distributed signals, respectively, from their noise-corrupted versions. The simulation study conducted on both synthetic and semi-synthetic data demonstrates the efficiency of our method compared to several baseline methods, particularly when the corruption is significant and impulsive in nature. Finally, we apply the presented methodology to forecast the pure autoregressive signal from the noise-corrupted data.</p></details> | 32 pages, 17 figures |

Unlike existing approaches, we do not rely on fixed historical windows and handcrafted features, but rather encode the entire recent possession, thereby avoiding the inclusion of potentially irrelevant or misleading historical information. Path signatures naturally capture the order and interaction of events, providing a mathematically grounded feature encoding for variable-length time series of irregular sampling frequencies without the necessity for manual feature engineering. Our proposed approach outperforms a transformer-based benchmark across various loss metrics and considerably reduces computational cost. Building on these results, we introduce a new possession evaluation metric based on well-established frameworks in soccer analytics, incorporating both predicted action type probabilities and action location. Our metric shows greater reliability than existing metrics in domain-specific comparisons. Finally, we validate our approach through a detailed analysis of the 2017/18 Premier League season and discuss further applications and future extensions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Approach for Estimating Largest Lyapunov Exponents in One-Dimensional Chaotic Time Series Using Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04868v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and quantifying chaos from data remains challenging. We present a data-driven method for estimating the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) from one-dimensional chaotic time series using machine learning. A predictor is trained to produce out-of-sample, multi-horizon forecasts; the LLE is then inferred from the exponential growth of the geometrically averaged forecast error (GMAE) across the horizon, which serves as a proxy for trajectory divergence. We validate the approach on four canonical 1D maps-logistic, sine, cubic, and Chebyshev-achieving R2pos > 0.99 against reference LLE curves with series as short as M = 450. Among baselines, KNN yields the closest fits (KNN-R comparable; RF larger deviations). By design the estimator targets positive exponents: in periodic/stable regimes it returns values indistinguishable from zero. Noise robustness is assessed by adding zero-mean white measurement noise and summarizing performance versus the average SNR over parameter sweeps: accuracy saturates for SNRm > 30 dB and collapses below 27 dB, a conservative sensor-level benchmark. The method is simple, computationally efficient, and model-agnostic, requiring only stationarity and the presence of a dominant positive exponent. It offers a practical route to LLE estimation in experimental settings where only scalar time-series measurements are available, with extensions to higher-dimensional and irregularly sampled data left for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 2 Tables, 14 Equations</p></details> |

Often, as grand-averaging techniques a priori assume normally-distributed parameters and linear, stationary processes in biorhythmic, time series data, important information is lost, averaged out as gross data. We developed an affective computing platform that enables taking brief data samples while maintaining personalized statistical power. This is achieved by combining a new data type derived from the micropeaks present in time series data registered from brief (5-second-long) face videos with recent advances in AI-driven face-grid estimation methods. By adopting geometric and nonlinear dynamical systems approaches to analyze the kinematics, especially the speed data, the new methods capture all facial micropeaks. These include as well the nuances of different affective micro expressions. We offer new ways to differentiate dynamical and geometric patterns present in autistic individuals from those found more commonly in neurotypical development.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under review in IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing</p></details> |

However, their potential for spatial modeling in multivariate time-series forecasting remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce a brand new SNN architecture, which is among the first to seamlessly integrate graph structural learning with spike-based temporal processing for multivariate time-series forecasting. Specifically, we first embed time features and an adaptive matrix, eliminating the need for predefined graph structures. We then further learn sequence features through the Observation (OBS) Block. Building upon this, our Multi-Scale Spike Aggregation (MSSA) hierarchically aggregates neighborhood information through spiking SAGE layers, enabling multi-hop feature extraction while eliminating the need for floating-point operations. Finally, we propose a Dual-Path Spike Fusion (DSF) Block to integrate spatial graph features and temporal dynamics via a spike-gated mechanism, combining LSTM-processed sequences with spiking self-attention outputs, effectively improve the model accuracy of long sequence datasets. Experiments show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art SNN-based iSpikformer on all datasets and outperforms traditional temporal models at long horizons, thereby establishing a new paradigm for efficient spatial-temporal modeling.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Not surprisingly, many forecasting methods are being proposed. To ensure progress, it is essential to be able to study and compare such methods empirically in a comprehensive and reliable manner. To achieve this, we propose TFB, an automated benchmark for Time Series Forecasting (TSF) methods. TFB advances the state-of-the-art by addressing shortcomings related to datasets, comparison methods, and evaluation pipelines: 1) insufficient coverage of data domains, 2) stereotype bias against traditional methods, and 3) inconsistent and inflexible pipelines. To achieve better domain coverage, we include datasets from 10 different domains: traffic, electricity, energy, the environment, nature, economic, stock markets, banking, health, and the web. We also provide a time series characterization to ensure that the selected datasets are comprehensive. To remove biases against some methods, we include a diverse range of methods, including statistical learning, machine learning, and deep learning methods, and we also support a variety of evaluation strategies and metrics to ensure a more comprehensive evaluations of different methods. To support the integration of different methods into the benchmark and enable fair comparisons, TFB features a flexible and scalable pipeline that eliminates biases. Next, we employ TFB to perform a thorough evaluation of 21 Univariate Time Series Forecasting (UTSF) methods on 8,068 univariate time series and 14 Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) methods on 25 datasets. The benchmark code and data are available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/TFB.

When expensive high-dimensional dynamical systems are coarse-grained into low-dimensional models, the entropic loss of information leads to emergent physics which are dissipative, history-dependent, and stochastic. To machine learn coarse-grained dynamics from time-series observations of particle trajectories, we propose a framework using the metriplectic bracket formalism that preserves these properties by construction; most notably, the framework guarantees discrete notions of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, conservation of momentum, and a discrete fluctuation-dissipation balance crucial for capturing non-equilibrium statistics. We introduce the mathematical framework abstractly before specializing to a particle discretization. As labels are generally unavailable for entropic state variables, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning strategy to identify emergent structural variables. We validate the method on benchmark systems and demonstrate its utility on two challenging examples: (1) coarse-graining star polymers at challenging levels of coarse-graining while preserving non-equilibrium statistics, and (2) learning models from high-speed video of colloidal suspensions that capture coupling between local rearrangement events and emergent stochastic dynamics. We provide open-source implementations in both PyTorch and LAMMPS, enabling large-scale inference and extensibility to diverse particle-based systems.</p></details> | 34 pages, 12 figures |

A carefully chosen set of identification conditions for the common component and the potentially nonstationary main effects is proposed to strengthen the interpretations of sparse main effects, while estimators of all model components are presented. Sparse estimation of the latent main effects is proposed using a doubly adaptive fused lasso estimation to allow for sparse sub-block detection, with theoretical guarantees and rates of convergence spelt out for the final estimators. Sparse block consistency for the main effects is also proved as a result. A realized Mallow's $C_p$ is developed for tuning parameter selection, with practical implementation described. Simulation experiments are performed under a variety of settings, showing our proposed estimators work well. A set of NYC taxi traffic data is analyzed, clearly showing the effects of Covid-19 lockdown, with prolonged sparse main effects detected.</p></details> | 43 pages, 7 figures |

The European Space Agency Benchmark for Anomaly Detection in Satellite Telemetry (ESA-ADB) aims to address this challenge and establish a new standard in the domain. It is a result of close cooperation between spacecraft operations engineers from the European Space Agency (ESA) and machine learning experts. The newly introduced ESA Anomalies Dataset contains annotated real-life telemetry from three different ESA missions, out of which two are included in ESA-ADB. Results of typical anomaly detection algorithms assessed in our novel hierarchical evaluation pipeline show that new approaches are necessary to address operators' needs.

They are also becoming increasingly complex, with recent trends indicating larger datasets, longer time series, and multi-modal integrations. Transformers, which have rapidly gained popularity due to their success in natural language processing and other domains, are well-suited to address these challenges due to their ability to model long-range dependencies and process data in parallel. But their application to EHR classification remains limited by data representations, which can reduce performance or fail to capture informative missingness. In this paper, we present the Bi-Axial Transformer (BAT), which attends to both the clinical variable and time point axes of EHR data to learn richer data relationships and address the difficulties of data sparsity. BAT achieves state-of-the-art performance on sepsis prediction and is competitive to top methods for mortality classification. In comparison to other transformers, BAT demonstrates increased robustness to data missingness, and learns unique sensor embeddings which can be used in transfer learning. Baseline models, which were previously located across multiple repositories or utilized deprecated libraries, were re-implemented with PyTorch and made available for reproduction and future benchmarking.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Interpreting Time Series Forecasts with LIME and SHAP: A Case Study on the Air Passengers Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12253v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting underpins critical decisions across aviation, energy, retail and health. Classical autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models offer interpretability via coefficients but struggle with nonlinearities, whereas tree-based machine-learning models such as XGBoost deliver high accuracy but are often opaque. This paper presents a unified framework for interpreting time-series forecasts using local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) and SHapley additive exPlanations (SHAP). We convert a univariate series into a leakage-free supervised learning problem, train a gradient-boosted tree alongside an ARIMA baseline and apply post-hoc explainability. Using the Air Passengers dataset as a case study, we show that a small set of lagged features -- particularly the twelve-month lag -- and seasonal encodings explain most forecast variance. We contribute: (i) a methodology for applying LIME and SHAP to time series without violating chronology; (ii) theoretical exposition of the underlying algorithms; (iii) empirical evaluation with extensive analysis; and (iv) guidelines for practitioners.</p></details> |  |
| **[STM3: Mixture of Multiscale Mamba for Long-Term Spatio-Temporal Time-Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12247v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, spatio-temporal time-series prediction has developed rapidly, yet existing deep learning methods struggle with learning complex long-term spatio-temporal dependencies efficiently. The long-term spatio-temporal dependency learning brings two new challenges: 1) The long-term temporal sequence includes multiscale information naturally which is hard to extract efficiently; 2) The multiscale temporal information from different nodes is highly correlated and hard to model. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient \textit{\textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}ultiscale \textbf{M}amba} (STM2) that includes a multiscale Mamba architecture to capture the multiscale information efficiently and simultaneously, and an adaptive graph causal convolution network to learn the complex multiscale spatio-temporal dependency. STM2 includes hierarchical information aggregation for different-scale information that guarantees their distinguishability. To capture diverse temporal dynamics across all spatial nodes more efficiently, we further propose an enhanced version termed \textit{\textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}ixture of \textbf{M}ultiscale \textbf{M}amba} (STM3) that employs a special Mixture-of-Experts architecture, including a more stable routing strategy and a causal contrastive learning strategy to enhance the scale distinguishability. We prove that STM3 has much better routing smoothness and guarantees the pattern disentanglement for each expert successfully. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate STM2/STM3's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in long-term spatio-temporal time-series prediction.</p></details> |  |

While transformer-based models have shown promise in time series analysis, most are designed for forecasting tasks and fail to fully exploit the unique characteristics of MedTS. In this paper, we introduce MedSpaformer, a transformer-based framework tailored for MedTS classification. It incorporates a sparse token-based dual-attention mechanism that enables global context modeling and token sparsification, allowing dynamic feature refinement by focusing on informative tokens while reducing redundancy. This mechanism is integrated into a multi-granularity cross-channel encoding scheme to capture intra- and inter-granularity temporal dependencies and inter-channel correlations, enabling progressive refinement of task-relevant patterns in medical signals. The sparsification design allows our model to flexibly accommodate inputs with variable lengths and channel dimensions. We also introduce an adaptive label encoder to extract label semantics and address cross-dataset label space misalignment. Together, these components enhance the model's transferability across heterogeneous medical datasets, which helps alleviate the challenge of label scarcity. Our model outperforms 13 baselines across 7 medical datasets under supervised learning. It also excels in few-shot learning and demonstrates zero-shot capability in both in-domain and cross-domain diagnostics. These results highlight MedSpaformer's robustness and its potential as a unified solution for MedTS classification across diverse settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 fig...</summary><p>4 figures, 9 pages, 4 tables</p></details> |

PanelMatch is an R package that implements a set of tools enabling researchers to apply matching methods for causal inference with time-series cross-sectional data. Relative to other commonly used methods for longitudinal analyses, like regression with fixed effects, the matching-based approach implemented in PanelMatch makes fewer parametric assumptions and offers more diagnostics. In this paper, we discuss the PanelMatch package, showing users a recommended pipeline for doing causal inference analysis with it and highlighting useful diagnostic and visualization tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Gaussian Processes with Latent Kronecker Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06895v2)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Applying Gaussian processes (GPs) to very large datasets remains a challenge due to limited computational scalability. Matrix structures, such as the Kronecker product, can accelerate operations significantly, but their application commonly entails approximations or unrealistic assumptions. In particular, the most common path to creating a Kronecker-structured kernel matrix is by evaluating a product kernel on gridded inputs that can be expressed as a Cartesian product. However, this structure is lost if any observation is missing, breaking the Cartesian product structure, which frequently occurs in real-world data such as time series. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging latent Kronecker structure, by expressing the kernel matrix of observed values as the projection of a latent Kronecker product. In combination with iterative linear system solvers and pathwise conditioning, our method facilitates inference of exact GPs while requiring substantially fewer computational resources than standard iterative methods. We demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art sparse and variational GPs on real-world datasets with up to five million examples, including robotics, automated machine learning, and climate applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Machine Learning 2025</p></details> |

Sufficient conditions for asymptotic equicontinuity are provided for nonstationary arrays of time series. This yields comprehensive general results that are applicable to various notions of dependence, which is exemplified in detail for nonstationary $\alpha$-mixing series. Especially, we obtain the weak convergence of the sequential process under essentially the same mild assumptions as known for the classical empirical process. Core ingredients of the proofs are a novel maximal inequality for nonmeasurable stochastic processes, uniform chaining arguments and, for the set-indexed smoothed process, uniform Lipschitz properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniCast: A Unified Multimodal Prompting Framework for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11954v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is a foundational task across domains, such as finance, healthcare, and environmental monitoring. While recent advances in Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have demonstrated strong generalisation through large-scale pretraining, existing models operate predominantly in a unimodal setting, ignoring the rich multimodal context, such as visual and textual signals, that often accompanies time series data in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces a novel parameter-efficient multimodal framework, UniCast, that extends TSFMs to jointly leverage time series, vision, and text modalities for enhanced forecasting performance. Our method integrates modality-specific embeddings from pretrained Vision and Text Encoders with a frozen TSFM via soft prompt tuning, enabling efficient adaptation with minimal parameter updates. This design not only preserves the generalisation strength of the foundation model but also enables effective cross-modal interaction. Extensive experiments across diverse time-series forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that UniCast consistently and significantly outperforms all existing TSFM baselines. The findings highlight the critical role of multimodal context in advancing the next generation of general-purpose time series forecasters.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we propose a novel computational pipeline to characterize and interpret these dependencies using a long-memory (LM) framework, which captures the slow, power-law decay of autocorrelation in resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) signals. The pipeline involves voxelwise estimation of LM parameters via a wavelet-based Bayesian method, yielding spatial maps that reflect temporal dependence across the brain. These maps are then projected onto a lower-dimensional space via a composite basis and are then related to individual-level covariates through group-level regression. We applied this approach to the ADHD-200 dataset and found significant positive associations between age in children and the LM parameter in the hippocampus, after adjusting for ADHD symptom severity and medication status. These findings complement prior neuroimaging work by linking long-range temporal dependence to developmental changes in memory-related brain regions. Overall, the proposed methodology enables detailed mapping of intrinsic temporal dynamics in rs-fMRI and offers new insights into the relationship between functional signal memory and brain development.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeSenCLIP: A Vision-Language Model for Remote Sensing Using Single-Pixel Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11919v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models have shown significant promise in remote sensing applications, particularly for land-use and land-cover (LULC) via zero-shot classification and retrieval. However, current approaches face two key challenges: reliance on large spatial tiles that increase computational cost, and dependence on text-based supervision, which is often not readily available. In this work, we present TimeSenCLIP, a lightweight framework that reevaluate the role of spatial context by evaluating the effectiveness of a single pixel by leveraging its temporal and spectral dimensions, for classifying LULC and ecosystem types. By leveraging spectral and temporal information from Sentinel-2 imagery and cross-view learning with geo-tagged ground-level photos, we minimises the need for caption-based training while preserving semantic alignment between overhead (satellite) and ground perspectives. Our approach is grounded in the LUCAS and Sen4Map datasets, and evaluated on classification tasks including LULC, crop type, and ecosystem type. We demonstrate that single pixel inputs, when combined with temporal and spectral cues, are sufficient for thematic mapping, offering a scalable and efficient alternative for large-scale remote sensing applications.

Over the past years, diffusion model has demonstrated its effectiveness in forecasting, imputation, generation, and anomaly detection in the time series domain. In this paper, we present a new approach for learning the physics-dependent temporal distribution of multivariate time series data using a weighted physics-informed loss during diffusion model training. A weighted physics-informed loss is constructed using a static weight schedule. This approach enables a diffusion model to accurately approximate underlying data distribution, which can influence the unsupervised anomaly detection performance. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that physics-informed training improves the F1 score in anomaly detection; it generates better data diversity and log-likelihood. Our model outperforms baseline approaches, additionally, it surpasses prior physics-informed work and purely data-driven diffusion models on a synthetic dataset and one real-world dataset while remaining competitive on others.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

Inspired by the human brain's mechanism of updating neural connections through learning and decision-making, we proposed a novel BRain-Inspired feature Fusion (BRIEF) framework, which is able to optimize network architecture automatically by incorporating an improved neural network connection search (NCS) strategy and a Transformer-based multi-feature fusion module. Specifically, we first extracted 4 types of fMRI temporal representations, i.e., time series (TCs), static/dynamic functional connection (FNC/dFNC), and multi-scale dispersion entropy (MsDE), to construct four encoders. Within each encoder, we employed a modified Q-learning to dynamically optimize the NCS to extract high-level feature vectors, where the NCS is formulated as a Markov Decision Process. Then, all feature vectors were fused via a Transformer, leveraging both stable/time-varying connections and multi-scale dependencies across different brain regions to achieve the final classification. Additionally, an attention module was embedded to improve interpretability. The classification performance of our proposed BRIEF was compared with 21 state-of-the-art models by discriminating two mental disorders from healthy controls: schizophrenia (SZ, n=1100) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD, n=1550). BRIEF demonstrated significant improvements of 2.2% to 12.1% compared to 21 algorithms, reaching an AUC of 91.5% - 0.6% for SZ and 78.4% - 0.5% for ASD, respectively. This is the first attempt to incorporate a brain-inspired, reinforcement learning strategy to optimize fMRI-based mental disorder classification, showing significant potential for identifying precise neuroimaging biomarkers.</p></details> |  |

We here introduce infomeasure, an open-source Python package designed to provide robust tools for calculating a wide variety of information-theoretic measures, including entropies, mutual information, transfer entropy and divergences. It is designed for both discrete and continuous variables; implements state-of-the-art estimation techniques; and allows the calculation of local measure values, $p$-values and $t$-scores. By unifying these approaches under one consistent framework, infomeasure aims to mitigate common pitfalls, ensure reproducibility, and simplify the practical implementation of information-theoretic analyses. In this contribution, we explore the motivation and features of infomeasure; its validation, using known analytical solutions; and exemplify its utility in a case study involving the analysis of human brain time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables, for documentation, see https://infomeasure.readthedocs.io/</p></details> |
| **[Factor Models of Matrix-Valued Time Series: Nonstationarity and Cointegration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11358v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we consider the nonstationary matrix-valued time series with common stochastic trends. Unlike the traditional factor analysis which flattens matrix observations into vectors, we adopt a matrix factor model in order to fully explore the intrinsic matrix structure in the data, allowing interaction between the row and column stochastic trends, and subsequently improving the estimation convergence. It also reduces the computation complexity in estimation. The main estimation methodology is built on the eigenanalysis of sample row and column covariance matrices when the nonstationary matrix factors are of full rank and the idiosyncratic components are temporally stationary, and is further extended to tackle a more flexible setting when the matrix factors are cointegrated and the idiosyncratic components may be nonstationary. Under some mild conditions which allow the existence of weak factors, we derive the convergence theory for the estimated factor loading matrices and nonstationary factor matrices. In particular, the developed methodology and theory are applicable to the general case of heterogeneous strengths over weak factors. An easy-to-implement ratio criterion is adopted to consistently estimate the size of latent factor matrix. Both simulation and empirical studies are conducted to examine the numerical performance of the developed model and methodology in finite samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Global Dataset of Location Data Integrity-Assessed Reforestation Efforts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11349v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Afforestation and reforestation are popular strategies for mitigating climate change by enhancing carbon sequestration. However, the effectiveness of these efforts is often self-reported by project developers, or certified through processes with limited external validation. This leads to concerns about data reliability and project integrity. In response to increasing scrutiny of voluntary carbon markets, this study presents a dataset on global afforestation and reforestation efforts compiled from primary (meta-)information and augmented with time-series satellite imagery and other secondary data. Our dataset covers 1,289,068 planting sites from 45,628 projects spanning 33 years. Since any remote sensing-based validation effort relies on the integrity of a planting site's geographic boundary, this dataset introduces a standardized assessment of the provided site-level location information, which we summarize in one easy-to-communicate key indicator: LDIS -- the Location Data Integrity Score. We find that approximately 79\% of the georeferenced planting sites monitored fail on at least 1 out of 10 LDIS indicators, while 15\% of the monitored projects lack machine-readable georeferenced data in the first place. In addition to enhancing accountability in the voluntary carbon market, the presented dataset also holds value as training data for e.g. computer vision-related tasks with millions of linked Sentinel-2 and Planetscope satellite images.</p></details> | 10 figures |
| **[TimeMKG: Knowledge-Infused Causal Reasoning for Multivariate Time Series Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09630v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series data typically comprises two distinct modalities: variable semantics and sampled numerical observations. Traditional time series models treat variables as anonymous statistical signals, overlooking the rich semantic information embedded in variable names and data descriptions. However, these textual descriptors often encode critical domain knowledge that is essential for robust and interpretable modeling. Here we present TimeMKG, a multimodal causal reasoning framework that elevates time series modeling from low-level signal processing to knowledge informed inference. TimeMKG employs large language models to interpret variable semantics and constructs structured Multivariate Knowledge Graphs that capture inter-variable relationships. A dual-modality encoder separately models the semantic prompts, generated from knowledge graph triplets, and the statistical patterns from historical time series. Cross-modality attention aligns and fuses these representations at the variable level, injecting causal priors into downstream tasks such as forecasting and classification, providing explicit and interpretable priors to guide model reasoning. The experiment in diverse datasets demonstrates that incorporating variable-level knowledge significantly improves both predictive performance and generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Air Quality PM2.5 Index Prediction Model Based on CNN-LSTM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11215v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the intensification of global climate change, accurate prediction of air quality indicators, especially PM2.5 concentration, has become increasingly important in fields such as environmental protection, public health, and urban management. To address this, we propose an air quality PM2.5 index prediction model based on a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture. The model effectively combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for local spatial feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for modeling temporal dependencies in time series data. Using a multivariate dataset collected from an industrial area in Beijing between 2010 and 2015 -- which includes hourly records of PM2.5 concentration, temperature, dew point, pressure, wind direction, wind speed, and precipitation -- the model predicts the average PM2.5 concentration over 6-hour intervals. Experimental results show that the model achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.236, outperforming traditional time series models in both accuracy and generalization. This demonstrates its strong potential in real-world applications such as air pollution early warning systems. However, due to the complexity of multivariate inputs, the model demands high computational resources, and its ability to handle diverse atmospheric factors still requires optimization. Future work will focus on enhancing scalability and expanding support for more complex multivariate weather prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |

This setting occurs in time series applications where responses depend on contemporaneous or past explanatory variables and persistent stochastic shocks, including financial modeling, hydrological forecasting, and meteorological applications requiring temporal dependency capture. Our methodology uses hierarchical Bayesian models with spike-and-slab priors to simultaneously select relevant covariates and lagged error terms. We propose an efficient two-stage MCMC algorithm separating sampling of variable inclusion indicators and model parameters to address high-dimensional computational challenges. Theoretical analysis establishes posterior selection consistency under mild conditions, even when candidate predictors grow exponentially with sample size, common in modern time series with many potential lagged variables. Through simulations and real applications (groundwater depth prediction, S&P 500 log returns modeling), we demonstrate substantial gains in variable selection accuracy and predictive performance. Compared to existing methods, our framework achieves lower MSPE, improved true model component identification, and greater robustness with autocorrelated noise, underscoring practical utility for model interpretation and forecasting in autoregressive settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Role of Entanglement in Quantum Reservoir Computing with Coupled Kerr Nonlinear Oscillators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11175v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) uses quantum dynamics to efficiently process temporal data. In this work, we investigate a QRC framework based on two coupled Kerr nonlinear oscillators, a system well-suited for time-series prediction tasks due to its complex nonlinear interactions and potentially high-dimensional state space. We explore how its performance in time-series prediction depends on key physical parameters: input drive strength, Kerr nonlinearity, and oscillator coupling, and analyze the role of entanglement in improving the reservoir's computational performance, focusing on its effect on predicting non-trivial time series. Using logarithmic negativity to quantify entanglement and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) to evaluate predictive accuracy, our results suggest that entanglement provides a computational advantage on average-up to a threshold in the input frequency-that persists under some levels of dissipation and dephasing. In particular, we find that higher dissipation rates can enhance performance. While the entanglement advantage manifests as improvements in both average and worst-case performance, it does not lead to improvements in the best-case error. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of quantum reservoirs for high performance, efficient quantum machine learning and time-series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incorporating Coupling Knowledge into Echo State Networks for Learning Spatiotemporally Chaotic Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01532v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning methods have shown promise in learning chaotic dynamical systems, enabling model-free short-term prediction and attractor reconstruction. However, when applied to large-scale, spatiotemporally chaotic systems, purely data-driven machine learning methods often suffer from inefficiencies, as they require a large learning model size and a massive amount of training data to achieve acceptable performance. To address this challenge, we incorporate the spatial coupling structure of the target system as an inductive bias in the network design. Specifically, we introduce physics-guided clustered echo state networks, leveraging the efficiency of the echo state networks as a base model. Experimental results on benchmark chaotic systems demonstrate that our physics-informed method outperforms existing echo state network models in learning the target chaotic systems. Additionally, we numerically demonstrate that leveraging coupling knowledge into ESN models can enhance their robustness to variations of training and target system conditions. We further show that our proposed model remains effective even when the coupling knowledge is imperfect or extracted directly from time series data. We believe this approach has the potential to enhance other machine-learning methods.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 figures |

We show that early bed-exit intent can be predicted using only one low-cost load cell mounted under a bed leg. The resulting load signals are first converted into a compact set of complementary images: an RGB line plot that preserves raw waveforms and three texture maps-recurrence plot, Markov transition field, and Gramian angular field-that expose higher-order dynamics. We introduce ViFusionTST, a dual-stream Swin Transformer that processes the line plot and texture maps in parallel and fuses them through cross-attention to learn data-driven modality weights. To provide a realistic benchmark, we collected six months of continuous data from 95 beds in a long-term-care facility. On this real-world dataset ViFusionTST reaches an accuracy of 0.885 and an F1 score of 0.794, surpassing recent 1D and 2D time-series baselines across F1, recall, accuracy, and AUPRC. The results demonstrate that image-based fusion of load-sensor signals for time series classification is a practical and effective solution for real-time, privacy-preserving fall prevention.</p></details> |  |

Understanding these underlying dynamics is crucial for precise future prediction. While deep learning has achieved major success in time series forecasting, many existing approaches do not explicitly model the dynamics. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepEDM, a framework that integrates nonlinear dynamical systems modeling with deep neural networks. Inspired by empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) and rooted in Takens' theorem, DeepEDM presents a novel deep model that learns a latent space from time-delayed embeddings, and employs kernel regression to approximate the underlying dynamics, while leveraging efficient implementation of softmax attention and allowing for accurate prediction of future time steps. To evaluate our method, we conduct comprehensive experiments on synthetic data of nonlinear dynamical systems as well as real-world time series across domains. Our results show that DeepEDM is robust to input noise, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in forecasting accuracy.

Here we propose a regression model that allows for a representation of periodic and dynamic patterns observed in time series data. The model incorporates a hidden strictly positive stochastic process that represents the instantaneous frequency, allowing the model to adapt and accurately capture varying time scales. A case study focusing on age estimation of narwhal tusks is presented, where cyclic element signals associated with annual growth layer groups are analyzed. We apply the methodology to data from one such tusk collected in West Greenland and use the fitted model to estimate the age of the narwhal. The proposed method is validated using simulated signals with known cycle counts and practical considerations and modelling challenges are discussed in detail. This research contributes to the field of time series analysis, providing a tool and valuable insights for understanding and modeling complex cyclic patterns in diverse domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empirical Investigation into Configuring Echo State Networks for Representative Benchmark Problem Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10887v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines Echo State Network, a reservoir computer, performance using four different benchmark problems, then proposes heuristics or rules of thumb for configuring the architecture, as well as the selection of parameters and their values, which are applicable to problems within the same domain, to help serve to fill the experience gap needed by those entering this field of study. The influence of various parameter selections and their value adjustments, as well as architectural changes made to an Echo State Network, a powerful recurrent neural network configured as a reservoir computer, can be challenging to fully comprehend without experience in the field, and even some hyperparameter optimization algorithms may have difficulty adjusting parameter values without proper manual selections made first. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the effects of parameters and their value selection on Echo State Network architecture performance for a successful build. Thus, to address the requirement for an extensive background in Echo State Network architecture, as well as examine how Echo State Network performance is affected with respect to variations in architecture, design, and parameter selection and values, a series of benchmark tasks representing different problem domains, including time series prediction, pattern generation, chaotic system prediction, and time series classification, were modeled and experimented on to show the impact on the performance of Echo State Network.</p></details> | 49 pages, 21 figures |

The literature has effectively tackled such a problem, mostly with automated planning techniques leveraging the PDDL+ language and solvers. However, such language has limitations when it comes to specifying optimisation statements and computing optimal plans. In this paper, we provide an alternative solution to the traffic signal optimisation problem based on Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP). We devise an encoding in a CASP language, which is then solved by means of clingcon 3, a system extending the well-known ASP solver clingo. We performed experiments on real historical data from the town of Huddersfield in the UK, comparing our approach to the PDDL+ model that obtained the best results for the considered benchmark. The results showed the potential of our approach for tackling the traffic signal optimisation problem and improving the solution quality of the PDDL+ plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP), Proceedings of ICLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Digital Life of Parisian Parks: Multifunctionality and Urban Context Uncovered by Mobile Application Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15516v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Landscape architecture typically considers urban parks through the lens of form and function. While past research on equitable access has focused mainly on form, studies of functions have been constrained by limited scale and coarse measurement. Existing efforts have partially quantified functions through small-scale surveys and movement data (e.g., GPS) or general usage records (e.g., CDR), but have not captured the activities and motivations underlying park visits. As a result, our understanding of the functional roles urban parks play remains incomplete. To address this gap, we introduce a method that refines mobile base station coverage using antenna azimuths, enabling clearer distinction of mobile traffic within parks versus surrounding areas. Using Paris as a case study, we analyze a large-scale set of passively collected per-app mobile network traffic - 492 million hourly records for 45 parks. We test two hypotheses: the central-city hypothesis, which posits multifunctional parks emerge in dense, high-rent areas due to land scarcity; and the socio-spatial hypothesis, which views parks as reflections of neighborhood routines and preferences. Our analysis shows that parks have distinctive mobile traffic signatures, differing from both their surroundings and from each other. By clustering parks on temporal and app usage patterns, we identify three functional types - lunchbreak, cultural, and recreational - with different visitation motivations. Centrally located parks (cultural and lunchbreak) display more diverse app use and temporal variation, while suburban (recreational) parks reflect digital behaviors of nearby communities, with app preferences aligned to neighborhood income. These findings demonstrate the value of mobile traffic as a proxy for studying urban green space functions, with implications for park planning, public health, and well-being.</p></details> |  |

Lightweight models like MobileNet and EfficientNet, which utilize depthwise convolution for feature extraction, have been developed for these devices. However, CIM macros often face challenges in accelerating depthwise convolution, including underutilization of CIM memory and heavy buffer traffic. The latter, in particular, has been overlooked despite its significant impact on latency and energy consumption. To address this, we introduce a novel CIM dataflow that significantly reduces buffer traffic by maximizing data reuse and improving memory utilization during depthwise convolution. The proposed dataflow is grounded in solid theoretical principles, fully demonstrated in this paper. When applied to MobileNet and EfficientNet models, our dataflow reduces buffer traffic by 77.4-87.0%, leading to a total reduction in data traffic energy and latency by 10.1-17.9% and 15.6-27.8%, respectively, compared to the baseline (conventional weight-stationary dataflow).</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Computer Design</p></details> |

Adaptive routing faces two main challenges: 1) how to accurately measure/estimate time-varying traffic matrices? 2) how to control the network and application performance degradation caused by frequent route changes? In this paper, we develop a novel data-enabled predictive traffic engineering (DeeP-TE) algorithm that minimizes the network congestion by gracefully adapting routing configurations over time. Our control algorithm can generate routing updates directly from the historical routing data and the corresponding link rate data, without direct traffic matrix measurement or estimation. Numerical experiments on real network topologies with real traffic matrices demonstrate that the proposed DeeP-TE routing adaptation algorithm can achieve close-to-optimal control effectiveness with significantly lower routing variations than the baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models (VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

We propose STPFormer, a Spatio-Temporal Pattern-Aware Transformer that achieves state-of-the-art performance via unified and interpretable representation learning. It integrates four modules: Temporal Position Aggregator (TPA) for pattern-aware temporal encoding, Spatial Sequence Aggregator (SSA) for sequential spatial learning, Spatial-Temporal Graph Matching (STGM) for cross-domain alignment, and an Attention Mixer for multi-scale fusion. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that STPFormer consistently sets new SOTA results, with ablation and visualizations confirming its effectiveness and generalizability.</p></details> |  |

However, in complex UAV perspectives, challenges such as small target scale variations, occlusions, nonlinear crossing motions, and motion blur severely hinder the stability of multi-object tracking. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel multi-object tracking framework, SocialTrack, aimed at enhancing the tracking accuracy and robustness of small targets in complex urban traffic environments. The specialized small-target detector enhances the detection performance by employing a multi-scale feature enhancement mechanism. The Velocity Adaptive Cubature Kalman Filter (VACKF) improves the accuracy of trajectory prediction by incorporating a velocity dynamic modeling mechanism. The Group Motion Compensation Strategy (GMCS) models social group motion priors to provide stable state update references for low-quality tracks, significantly improving the target association accuracy in complex dynamic environments. Furthermore, the Spatio-Temporal Memory Prediction (STMP) leverages historical trajectory information to predict the future state of low-quality tracks, effectively mitigating identity switching issues. Extensive experiments on the UAVDT and MOT17 datasets demonstrate that SocialTrack outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across several key metrics. Significant improvements in MOTA and IDF1, among other core performance indicators, highlight its superior robustness and adaptability. Additionally, SocialTrack is highly modular and compatible, allowing for seamless integration with existing trackers to further enhance performance.</p></details> |  |

This study presents a decentralized, federated learning framework tailored for traffic sign detection in vehicular networks to enable collaborative model training without sharing raw data. The framework partitioned traffic sign classes across vehicles for specialized local training using lightweight object detectors, aggregated model parameters via algorithms like FedProx, FedAdam and FedAVG in a simulated environment with the Flower framework, and evaluated multiple configurations including varying server rounds, local epochs, client participation fractions, and data distributions. Experiments demonstrated that increasing server rounds from 2 to 20 boosted accuracy from below 0.1 to over 0.8, moderate local epochs (8-10) provided optimal efficiency with accuracies around 0.67, higher client participation fractions enhanced generalization up to 0.83, FedProx outperformed other aggregators in handling heterogeneity, non-IID data distributions reduced performance compared to IID, and training duration primarily scaled with the number of rounds rather than aggregation strategy. We conclude that this federated approach may offer a scalable, privacy-preserving solution for real-world vehicular deployments, potentially guiding future integrations of robust aggregation and communication optimizations to advance intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> | 7 pages, 10 figures |

Dataset-based methods reproduce realistic trajectories but suffer from covariate shift in closed-loop deployment, compounded by simplified dynamics models that further reduce reliability. Conversely, physics-based simulation methods enhance reliable and controllable closed-loop interactions but often lack expert demonstrations, compromising realism. To address these challenges, we introduce a dual-stage AV-centric simulation framework that conducts open-loop imitation learning pre-training in a data-driven simulator to capture trajectory-level realism and route-level controllability, followed by closed-loop reinforcement learning fine-tuning in a physics-based simulator to enhance style-level controllability and mitigate covariate shift. In the fine-tuning stage, we propose RIFT, a novel RL fine-tuning strategy that evaluates all candidate modalities through group-relative optimization with a dual-clip surrogate objective, enhancing style-level controllability and mitigating covariate shift, while preserving the trajectory-level realism and route-level controllability inherited from IL pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFT improves realism and controllability in traffic simulation while simultaneously exposing the limitations of modern AV systems in closed-loop evaluation.

While Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) enforce PDE constraints point-wise, this paper adopts a physics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet) framework that reformulates TSE as an operator learning problem. Our approach trains a parameterized neural operator that maps sparse input data to the full spatiotemporal traffic state field, governed by the traffic flow conservation law. Crucially, unlike PINNs that enforce PDE constraints point-wise, PI-DeepONet integrates traffic flow conservation model and the fundamental diagram directly into the operator learning process, ensuring physical consistency while capturing congestion propagation, spatial correlations, and temporal evolution. Experiments on the NGSIM dataset demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines. Further analysis reveals insights into optimal function generation strategies and branch network complexity. Additionally, the impact of input function generation methods and the number of functions on model performance is explored, highlighting the robustness and efficacy of proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review in Transportmetrica B: Transport Dynamics</p></details> |

Observing unsolicited and erroneous traffic, such as unanswered traffic or errors, is fundamental to detect misconfiguration, temporary failures or attacks. ChamaleoNet transforms any production network into a transparent monitor to let administrators collect unsolicited and erroneous traffic directed to hosts, whether offline or active, hosting a server or a client, protected by a firewall, or unused addresses. ChamaleoNet is programmed to ignore well-formed traffic and collect only erroneous packets, including those generated by misconfigured or infected internal hosts, and those sent by external actors which scan for services. Engineering such a system poses several challenges, from scalability to privacy. Leveraging the SDN paradigm, ChamaleoNet processes the traffic flowing through a campus/corporate network and focuses on erroneous packets only, lowering the pressure on the collection system while respecting privacy regulations by design. ChamaleoNet enables the seamless integration with active deceptive systems like honeypots that can impersonate unused hosts/ports/services and engage with senders. The SDN in-hardware filtering reduces the traffic to the controller by 96%, resulting in a scalable solution, which we offer as open source. Simple analytics unveil internal misconfigured and infected hosts, identify temporary failures, and enhance visibility on external radiation produced by attackers looking for vulnerable services.</p></details> | 17 pages, 16 figures |
| **[SafePLUG: Empowering Multimodal LLMs with Pixel-Level Insight and Temporal Grounding for Traffic Accident Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06763v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a range of vision-language tasks and demonstrate strong potential for traffic accident understanding. However, existing MLLMs in this domain primarily focus on coarse-grained image-level or video-level comprehension and often struggle to handle fine-grained visual details or localized scene components, limiting their applicability in complex accident scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose SafePLUG, a novel framework that empowers MLLMs with both Pixel-Level Understanding and temporal Grounding for comprehensive traffic accident analysis. SafePLUG supports both arbitrary-shaped visual prompts for region-aware question answering and pixel-level segmentation based on language instructions, while also enabling the recognition of temporally anchored events in traffic accident scenarios. To advance the development of MLLMs for traffic accident understanding, we curate a new dataset containing multimodal question-answer pairs centered on diverse accident scenarios, with detailed pixel-level annotations and temporal event boundaries. Experimental results show that SafePLUG achieves strong performance on multiple tasks, including region-based question answering, pixel-level segmentation, temporal event localization, and accident event understanding. These capabilities lay a foundation for fine-grained understanding of complex traffic scenes, with the potential to improve driving safety and enhance situational awareness in smart transportation systems.

| **[Euclidean Approach to Green-Wave Theory Applied to Traffic Signal Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12146v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Travel on long arterials with signalized intersections can be inefficient if not coordinated properly. As the number of signals increases, coordination becomes more challenging and traditional progression schemes tend to break down. Long progressions save travel time and fuel, reduce pollution and traffic accidents by providing a smoother flow of traffic. This paper introduces a green-wave theory that can be applied to a network of intersecting arterial roads. It enables uninterrupted flow on arbitrary long signalized arterials using a Road-to-Traveler-Feedback Device. The approach is modelled after Euclid. We define concepts such as RGW-roads (roads where vehicles traveling at the recommended speed make all traffic signals), green-arrows (representing vehicle platoons), real nodes (representing signalized intersections where RGW-roads intersect) and virtual nodes, green-wave speed, blocks, etc. - the analogue of Euclid's postulates. We then use geometric reasoning to deduce results: green-arrow lengths have a maximum value, are restricted to discrete lengths, and green-arrow laws of motion imply that select existing arterial roads can be converted to RGW-roads. The signal timings and offsets that are produced have been shown to be effective using a simulation model developed previously called RGW-SIM.</p></details> | 74 pages, 49 figures |
| **[Scale-Disentangled spatiotemporal Modeling for Long-term Traffic Emission Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11923v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term traffic emission forecasting is crucial for the comprehensive management of urban air pollution. Traditional forecasting methods typically construct spatiotemporal graph models by mining spatiotemporal dependencies to predict emissions. However, due to the multi-scale entanglement of traffic emissions across time and space, these spatiotemporal graph modeling method tend to suffer from cascading error amplification during long-term inference. To address this issue, we propose a Scale-Disentangled Spatio-Temporal Modeling (SDSTM) framework for long-term traffic emission forecasting. It leverages the predictability differences across multiple scales to decompose and fuse features at different scales, while constraining them to remain independent yet complementary. Specifically, the model first introduces a dual-stream feature decomposition strategy based on the Koopman lifting operator. It lifts the scale-coupled spatiotemporal dynamical system into an infinite-dimensional linear space via Koopman operator, and delineates the predictability boundary using gated wavelet decomposition. Then a novel fusion mechanism is constructed, incorporating a dual-stream independence constraint based on cross-term loss to dynamically refine the dual-stream prediction results, suppress mutual interference, and enhance the accuracy of long-term traffic emission prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on a road-level traffic emission dataset within Xi'an's Second Ring Road demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces a curated dataset of more than 3 million people involved in accidents in Ohio over six years (2017-2022), aggregated to more than 2.3 million vehicle-level records for predictive analysis. The primary contribution is a transparent and reproducible methodology that combines Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and explainable artificial intelligence (AI) to identify and interpret key risk factors associated with severe crashes. Using the JADBio AutoML platform, predictive models were constructed to distinguish between severe and non-severe crash outcomes. The models underwent rigorous feature selection across stratified training subsets, and their outputs were interpreted using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to quantify the contribution of individual features. A final Ridge Logistic Regression model achieved an AUC-ROC of 85.6% on the training set and 84.9% on a hold-out test set, with 17 features consistently identified as the most influential predictors. Key features spanned demographic, environmental, vehicle, human, and operational categories, including location type, posted speed, minimum occupant age, and pre-crash action. Notably, certain traditionally emphasized factors, such as alcohol or drug impairment, were less influential in the final model compared to environmental and contextual variables. Emphasizing methodological rigor and interpretability over mere predictive performance, this study offers a scalable framework to support Vision Zero with aligned interventions and advanced data-informed traffic safety policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

To address this, we introduce a novel, end-to-end approach, $\texttt{AirTrafficGen}$, that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate and control the generation of complex ATC scenarios. Our method uses a purpose-built, graph-based representation to encode sector topology (including airspace geometry, routes, and fixes) into a format LLMs can process. Through rigorous benchmarking, we show that state-of-the-art models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, OpenAI o3, GPT-oss-120b and GPT-5 can generate high-traffic scenarios while maintaining operational realism. Our engineered prompting enables fine-grained control over interaction presence, type, and location. Initial findings suggest these models are also capable of iterative refinement, correcting flawed scenarios based on simple textual feedback. This approach provides a scalable alternative to manual scenario design, addressing the need for a greater volume and variety of ATC training and validation simulations. More broadly, this work showcases the potential of LLMs for complex planning in safety-critical domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages and appendices</p></details> |

However, the realism of a simulation depends extensively on the quality of input data. This paper presents an intersection traffic simulation tool that leverages real-world vehicle turning movement count (TMC) data from the City of Toronto to model traffic in an urban environment at an individual or multiple intersections using Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO). The simulation performed in this research focuses specifically on intersection-level traffic generation without creating full vehicle routes through the network. This also helps keep the network's complexity to a minimum. The simulated traffic is evaluated against actual data to show that the simulation closely reproduces real intersection flows. This validates that the real data can drive practical simulations, and these scenarios can replace synthetic or random generated data, which is prominently used in developing new traffic-related methodologies. This is the first tool to integrate TMC data from Toronto into SUMO via an easy-to-use Graphical User Interface. This work contributes to the research and traffic planning community on data-driven traffic simulation. It provides transportation engineers with a framework to evaluate intersection design and traffic signal optimization strategies using readily available aggregate traffic data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2025 21st DCOSS-IoT, Code is available at Github: https://github.com/ANTS-OntarioTechU/CrossFlow</p></details> |
| **[Beyond conventional vision: RGB-event fusion for robust object detection in dynamic traffic scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10704v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dynamic range limitation of conventional RGB cameras reduces global contrast and causes loss of high-frequency details such as textures and edges in complex traffic environments (e.g., nighttime driving, tunnels), hindering discriminative feature extraction and degrading frame-based object detection. To address this, we integrate a bio-inspired event camera with an RGB camera to provide high dynamic range information and propose a motion cue fusion network (MCFNet), which achieves optimal spatiotemporal alignment and adaptive cross-modal feature fusion under challenging lighting. Specifically, an event correction module (ECM) temporally aligns asynchronous event streams with image frames via optical-flow-based warping, jointly optimized with the detection network to learn task-aware event representations. The event dynamic upsampling module (EDUM) enhances spatial resolution of event frames to match image structures, ensuring precise spatiotemporal alignment. The cross-modal mamba fusion module (CMM) uses adaptive feature fusion with a novel interlaced scanning mechanism, effectively integrating complementary information for robust detection. Experiments conducted on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate that MCFNet significantly outperforms existing methods in various poor lighting and fast moving traffic scenarios. Notably, on the DSEC-Det dataset, MCFNet achieves a remarkable improvement, surpassing the best existing methods by 7.4% in mAP50 and 1.7% in mAP metrics, respectively.

| **[Gaze-Based Indicators of Driver Cognitive Distraction: Effects of Different Traffic Conditions and Adaptive Cruise Control Use](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10624v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this simulator study, we investigate how gaze parameters reflect driver cognitive distraction under varying traffic conditions and adaptive cruise control (ACC) use. Participants completed six driving scenarios that combined two levels of cognitive distraction (with/without mental calculations) and three levels of driving environment complexity. Throughout the experiment, participants were free to activate or deactivate an ACC. We analyzed two gaze-based indicators of driver cognitive distraction: the percent road center, and the gaze dispersions (horizontal and vertical). Our results show that vertical gaze dispersion increases with traffic complexity, while ACC use leads to gaze concentration toward the road center. Cognitive distraction reduces road center gaze and increases vertical dispersion. Complementary analyses revealed that these observations actually arise mainly between mental calculations, while periods of mental calculations are characterized by a temporary increase in gaze concentration.</p></details> |  |

Participants drove in six scenarios, combining two levels of cognitive distraction (presence/absence of a mental calculation task) and three levels of driving environment complexity (different traffic conditions). Throughout the experiment, they were free to activate or deactivate ACC (ACC use, two levels). We analyzed three EDA-based indicators of cognitive distraction: SCL (mean skin conductance level), SCR amplitude (mean amplitude of skin conductance responses), and SCR rate (rate of skin conductance responses). Results indicate that all three indicators were significantly influenced by cognitive distraction and ACC use, while environment complexity influenced SCL and SCR amplitude, but not SCR rate. These findings suggest that EDA-based indicators reflect variations in drivers' mental workload due not only to cognitive distraction, but also to driving environment and automation use.</p></details> |  |
| **[M3-Net: A Cost-Effective Graph-Free MLP-Based Model for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08543v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving accurate traffic prediction is a fundamental but crucial task in the development of current intelligent transportation systems.Most of the mainstream methods that have made breakthroughs in traffic prediction rely on spatio-temporal graph neural networks, spatio-temporal attention mechanisms, etc. The main challenges of the existing deep learning approaches are that they either depend on a complete traffic network structure or require intricate model designs to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. These limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction performance and lightweight deployment.</p></details> |  |

Perimeter control of a Protected Network (PN) has emerged as a potential solution to reducing gridlock in urban networks. This paper proposes a novel auction-based mechanism for green time allocation at signalized intersections, for effective perimeter control application. Utilising a Sealed Bid, Second Price auction framework, our approach combines real-time traffic monitoring with market-inspired mechanisms to regulate vehicle inflows into PN areas. Unlike existing methods that focus primarily on gated links, our system allocates budgets to individual traffic movements, providing greater flexibility in managing multi-directional flows. We evaluate the proposed mechanism using a test case intersection with a single controlled inflow, comparing it against a volume-based fixed-time approach. The results demonstrate that our auction-based method controls flows into the PN with improved accuracy, outperforming the volume-based approach in terms of inflow regulation, queue management and delays. The framework can be applied in real time to any generic intersection, offering a scalable solution for urban traffic management. This work bridges the gap between perimeter control and market-based intersection auctions, providing a pathway for further research on adaptive traffic management systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluation of Bio-Inspired Models under Different Learning Settings For Energy Efficiency in Network Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17565v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cellular traffic forecasting is a critical task that enables network operators to efficiently allocate resources and address anomalies in rapidly evolving environments. The exponential growth of data collected from base stations poses significant challenges to processing and analysis. While machine learning (ML) algorithms have emerged as powerful tools for handling these large datasets and providing accurate predictions, their environmental impact, particularly in terms of energy consumption, is often overlooked in favor of their predictive capabilities. This study investigates the potential of two bio-inspired models: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Reservoir Computing through Echo State Networks (ESNs) for cellular traffic forecasting. The evaluation focuses on both their predictive performance and energy efficiency. These models are implemented in both centralized and federated settings to analyze their effectiveness and energy consumption in decentralized systems. Additionally, we compare bio-inspired models with traditional architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), to provide a comprehensive evaluation. Using data collected from three diverse locations in Barcelona, Spain, we examine the trade-offs between predictive accuracy and energy demands across these approaches. The results indicate that bio-inspired models, such as SNNs and ESNs, can achieve significant energy savings while maintaining predictive accuracy comparable to traditional architectures. Furthermore, federated implementations were tested to evaluate their energy efficiency in decentralized settings compared to centralized systems, particularly in combination with bio-inspired models. These findings offer valuable insights into the potential of bio-inspired models for sustainable and privacy-preserving cellular traffic forecasting.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

This study addresses binary VPN detection, distinguishing VPN-encrypted from non-VPN traffic using wavelet transform-based features across multiple machine learning models. Unlike previous studies focused on application-level classification within encrypted traffic, we specifically evaluate the fundamental task of VPN identification regardless of application type. We analyze the impact of wavelet decomposition levels and dataset filtering on classification performance across significantly imbalanced data, where filtering reduces some traffic categories by up to 95%. Our results demonstrate that Random Forest (RF) achieves superior performance with an F1-score of 99%, maintaining robust accuracy even after significant dataset filtering. Neural Networks (NN) show comparable effectiveness with an F1-score of 98% when trained on wavelet level 12, while Support Vector Machines (SVM) exhibit notable sensitivity to dataset reduction, with F1-scores dropping from 90% to 85% after filtering. Comparing wavelet decomposition at levels 5 and 12, we observe improved classification performance at level 12, particularly for variable traffic types, though the marginal gains may not justify the additional computational overhead. These findings establish RF as the most reliable model for VPN traffic classification while highlighting key performance tradeoffs in feature extraction and preprocessing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at SoftCOM 2025</p></details> |

Focusing resources on the causes of congestion is a potentially efficient strategy for reducing slowdowns. We present NEXICA, an algorithm to discover which parts of the highway system tend to cause slowdowns on other parts of the highway. We use time series of road speeds as inputs to our causal discovery algorithm. Finding other algorithms inadequate, we develop a new approach that is novel in three ways. First, it concentrates on just the presence or absence of events in the time series, where an event indicates the temporal beginning of a traffic slowdown. Second, we develop a probabilistic model using maximum likelihood estimation to compute the probabilities of spontaneous and caused slowdowns between two locations on the highway. Third, we train a binary classifier to identify pairs of cause/effect locations trained on pairs of road locations where we are reasonably certain a priori of their causal connections, both positive and negative. We test our approach on six months of road speed data from 195 different highway speed sensors in the Los Angeles area, showing that our approach is superior to state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and computation speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of short paper in 32nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems (ACM SIGSPATIAL 2024)</p></details> |
| **[From Micro to Macro Flow Modeling: Characterizing Heterogeneity of Mixed-Autonomy Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09432v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most autonomous-vehicles (AVs) driving strategies are designed and analyzed at the vehicle level, yet their aggregate impact on macroscopic traffic flow is still not understood, particularly the flow heterogeneity that emerges when AVs interact with human-driven vehicles (HVs). Existing validation techniques for macroscopic flow models rely on high-resolution spatiotemporal data spanning entire road segments which are rarely available for mixed-autonomy traffic. AVs record detailed Lagrangian trajectories of the ego vehicle and surrounding traffic through onboard sensors. Leveraging these Lagrangian observations to validate mixed-autonomy flow models therefore remains an open research challenge. This paper closes the gap between microscopic Lagrangian data and macroscopic Euclidean traffic models by introducing a continuous traffic-heterogeneity attribute. We represent traffic flow with two coupled conservation laws with one for vehicle number and one for the traffic attribute. Reconstruction methods are designed to derive the traffic attribute from Lagrangian vehicle trajectories. When abundant trajectory data are available, we characterize traffic heterogeneity by extracting drivers' desired speed and local behavioral uncertainty from trajectories. In data-scarce mixed traffic, we design an end-to-end mapping that infers the traffic heterogeneity solely from trajectories in the current spatiotemporal region. Experiments across multiple traffic datasets show that the proposed model effectively captures traffic heterogeneity by clustering the fundamental diagram scatter into attribute-based groups. The calibration errors of traffic flow dynamics are also reduce by 20% relative to the Aw-Rascle-Zhang model benchmark. Detailed analyses further show that the model generalizes well, maintaining nearly the same accuracy when evaluated under a variety of previously unseen traffic conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Carbon Pricing in Traffic Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09280v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic is a significant source of global carbon emissions. In this paper, we study how carbon pricing can be used to guide traffic towards equilibria that respect given emission budgets. In particular, we consider a general multi-commodity flow model with flow-dependent externalities. These externalities may represent carbon emissions, entering a priced area, or the traversal of paths regulated by tradable credit schemes. We provide a complete characterization of all flows that can be attained as Wardrop equilibria when assigning a single price to each externality. More precisely, we show that every externality budget achievable by any feasible flow in the network can also be achieved as a Wardrop equilibrium by setting appropriate prices. For extremal and Pareto-minimal budgets, we show that there are prices such that all equilibria respect the budgets. Although the proofs of existence of these particular prices rely on fixed-point arguments and are non-constructive, we show that in the case where the equilibrium minimizes a convex potential, the prices can be obtained as Lagrange multipliers of a suitable convex program. In the case of a single externality, we prove that the total externality caused by the traffic flow is decreasing in the price. For increasing, continuous, and piecewise affine travel time functions with a single externality, we give an output-polynomial algorithm that computes all equilibria implementable by pricing the externality. Even though there are networks where the output size is exponential in the input size, we show that the minimal price obeying a given budget can be computed in polynomial time. This allows the efficient computation of the market price of tradable credit schemes. Overall, our results show that carbon pricing is a viable and (under mild assumptions) tractable approach to achieve all feasible emission goals in traffic networks.</p></details> | 29 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Generalising Traffic Forecasting to Regions without Traffic Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08947v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation systems. Accurate forecasting relies on continuous observations collected by traffic sensors. However, due to high deployment and maintenance costs, not all regions are equipped with such sensors. This paper aims to forecast for regions without traffic sensors, where the lack of historical traffic observations challenges the generalisability of existing models. We propose a model named GenCast, the core idea of which is to exploit external knowledge to compensate for the missing observations and to enhance generalisation. We integrate physics-informed neural networks into GenCast, enabling physical principles to regularise the learning process. We introduce an external signal learning module to explore correlations between traffic states and external signals such as weather conditions, further improving model generalisability. Additionally, we design a spatial grouping module to filter localised features that hinder model generalisability. Extensive experiments show that GenCast consistently reduces forecasting errors on multiple real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

The goal is to examine novel, under-researched features of commercially available ADAS technologies. The experimental campaign, conducted in the I-24 highway near Nashville, TN, US, collected data on the kinematics and safety margins of assisted lane changes in real-world conditions. The results show that the kinematics of assisted lane changes are consistent for each system, with four out of five vehicles using slower speeds and decelerations than human drivers. However, one system consistently performed more assertive lane changes, completing the maneuver in around 5 seconds. Regarding safety margins, only three vehicles are investigated. Those operated in the US are not restricted by relevant UN regulations, and their designs were found not to adhere to these regulatory requirements. A simulation method used to classify the challenge level for the vehicle receiving the lane change, showing that these systems can force trailing vehicles to decelerate to keep a safe gap. One assisted system was found to have performed a maneuver that posed a hard challenge level for the other vehicle, raising concerns about the safety of these systems in real-world operation. All three vehicles were found to carry out lane changes that induced decelerations to the vehicle in the target lane. Those decelerations could affect traffic flow, inducing traffic shockwaves.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 Figures |

The recent success of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs raises the question of how to deploy them efficiently, considering their underlying structure. During the inference in MoE LLMs, only a small part of the experts is selected to process a given token. Moreover, in practice, the experts' load is highly imbalanced. For efficient deployment, one has to distribute the model across a large number of servers using a model placement algorithm. Thus, to improve cluster utilization, the model placement algorithm has to take into account the network topology. This work focuses on the efficient topology-aware placement of the pre-trained MoE LLMs in the inference stage. We propose an integer linear program (ILP) that determines the optimal placement of experts, minimizing the expected number of transmissions. Due to the internal structure, this optimization problem can be solved with a standard ILP solver. We demonstrate that ILP-based placement strategy yields lower network traffic than competitors for small-scale (DeepSeekMoE~16B) and large-scale (DeepSeek-R1~671B) models.</p></details> |  |

| **[Combat Urban Congestion via Collaboration: Heterogeneous GNN-based MARL for Coordinated Platooning and Traffic Signal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10948v3)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the years, reinforcement learning has emerged as a popular approach to develop signal control and vehicle platooning strategies either independently or in a hierarchical way. However, jointly controlling both in real-time to alleviate traffic congestion presents new challenges, such as the inherent physical and behavioral heterogeneity between signal control and platooning, as well as coordination between them. This paper proposes an innovative solution to tackle these challenges based on heterogeneous graph multi-agent reinforcement learning and traffic theories. Our approach involves: 1) designing platoon and signal control as distinct reinforcement learning agents with their own set of observations, actions, and reward functions to optimize traffic flow; 2) designing coordination by incorporating graph neural networks within multi-agent reinforcement learning to facilitate seamless information exchange among agents on a regional scale; 3) applying alternating optimization for training, allowing agents to update their own policies and adapt to other agents' policies. We evaluate our approach through SUMO simulations, which show convergent results in terms of both travel time and fuel consumption, and superior performance compared to other adaptive signal control methods.</p></details> |  |

However, it encounters significant challenges including harsh communication environments, limited energy supply, and restricted signal transmission. This paper aims to provide efficient and reliable communication in underwater networks with limited energy and communication resources by optimizing the scheduling of communication links and adjusting transmission parameters (e.g., transmit power and transmission rate). The efficient and reliable communication multi-objective optimization problem (ERCMOP) is formulated as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP). A Traffic Load-Aware Resource Management (TARM) strategy based on deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is presented to address this problem. Specifically, a traffic load-aware mechanism that leverages the overhear information from neighboring nodes is designed to mitigate the disparity between partial observations and global states. Moreover, by incorporating a solution space optimization algorithm, the number of candidate solutions for the deep MARL-based decision-making model can be effectively reduced, thereby optimizing the computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the adaptability of TARM in various scenarios with different transmission demands and collision probabilities, while also validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in supporting efficient and reliable communication in underwater networks with limited resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</p></details> |

One crucial step is modeling the volume of traffic demand. But past demand modeling approaches have relied on unrealistic or suboptimal heuristics, and they have failed to adequately account for the effects of noisy and multimodal data on simulation outcomes. In this work, we integrate advances in AI to construct a three-step, end-to-end pipeline for systematically modeling traffic demand from detector data: computer vision for vehicle counting from noisy camera footage, combinatorial optimization for vehicle route generation from multimodal data, and large language models for iterative simulation refinement from natural language feedback. Using a road network from Strongsville, Ohio as a testbed, we show that our pipeline accurately captures the city's traffic patterns in a granular simulation. Beyond Strongsville, incorporating noise and multimodality makes our framework generalizable to municipalities with different levels of data and infrastructure availability.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages; 1 table; 6 figures; extended version of accepted version, published at the 2025 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC '25)</p></details> |
| **[A Physics-informed Deep Operator for Real-Time Freeway Traffic State Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08002v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic state estimation (TSE) falls methodologically into three categories: model-driven, data-driven, and model-data dual-driven. Model-driven TSE relies on macroscopic traffic flow models originated from hydrodynamics. Data-driven TSE leverages historical sensing data and employs statistical models or machine learning methods to infer traffic state. Model-data dual-driven traffic state estimation attempts to harness the strengths of both aspects to achieve more accurate TSE. From the perspective of mathematical operator theory, TSE can be viewed as a type of operator that maps available measurements of inerested traffic state into unmeasured traffic state variables in real time. For the first time this paper proposes to study real-time freeway TSE in the idea of physics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet), which is an operator-oriented architecture embedding traffic flow models based on deep neural networks. The paper has developed an extended architecture from the original PI-DeepONet. The extended architecture is featured with: (1) the acceptance of 2-D data input so as to support CNN-based computations; (2) the introduction of a nonlinear expansion layer, an attention mechanism, and a MIMO mechanism; (3) dedicated neural network design for adaptive identification of traffic flow model parameters. A traffic state estimator built on the basis of this extended PI-DeepONet architecture was evaluated with respect to a short freeway stretch of NGSIM and a large-scale urban expressway in China, along with other four baseline TSE methods. The evaluation results demonstrated that this novel TSE method outperformed the baseline methods with high-precision estimation results of flow and mean speed.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Noise-Aware Generative Microscopic Traffic Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07453v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately modeling individual vehicle behavior in microscopic traffic simulation remains a key challenge in intelligent transportation systems, as it requires vehicles to realistically generate and respond to complex traffic phenomena such as phantom traffic jams. While traditional human driver simulation models offer computational tractability, they do so by abstracting away the very complexity that defines human driving. On the other hand, recent advances in infrastructure-mounted camera-based roadway sensing have enabled the extraction of vehicle trajectory data, presenting an opportunity to shift toward generative, agent-based models. Yet, a major bottleneck remains: most existing datasets are either overly sanitized or lack standardization, failing to reflect the noisy, imperfect nature of real-world sensing. Unlike data from vehicle-mounted sensors-which can mitigate sensing artifacts like occlusion through overlapping fields of view and sensor fusion-infrastructure-based sensors surface a messier, more practical view of challenges that traffic engineers encounter. To this end, we present the I-24 MOTION Scenario Dataset (I24-MSD)-a standardized, curated dataset designed to preserve a realistic level of sensor imperfection, embracing these errors as part of the learning problem rather than an obstacle to overcome purely from preprocessing. Drawing from noise-aware learning strategies in computer vision, we further adapt existing generative models in the autonomous driving community for I24-MSD with noise-aware loss functions. Our results show that such models not only outperform traditional baselines in realism but also benefit from explicitly engaging with, rather than suppressing, data imperfection. We view I24-MSD as a stepping stone toward a new generation of microscopic traffic simulation that embraces the real-world challenges and is better aligned with practical needs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Traffic Oscillations in Mixed Traffic Flow with Scalable Deep Koopman Predictive Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00043v3)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mitigating traffic oscillations in mixed flows of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) is critical for enhancing traffic stability. A key challenge lies in modeling the nonlinear, heterogeneous behaviors of HDVs within computationally tractable predictive control frameworks. This study proposes an adaptive deep Koopman predictive control framework (AdapKoopPC) to address this issue. The framework features a novel deep Koopman network, AdapKoopnet, which represents complex HDV car-following dynamics as a linear system in a high-dimensional space by adaptively learning from naturalistic data. This learned linear representation is then embedded into a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme, enabling real-time, scalable, and optimal control of CAVs. We validate our framework using the HighD dataset and extensive numerical simulations. Results demonstrate that AdapKoopnet achieves superior trajectory prediction accuracy over baseline models. Furthermore, the complete AdapKoopPC controller significantly dampens traffic oscillations with lower computational cost, exhibiting strong performance even at low CAV penetration rates. The proposed framework offers a scalable and data-driven solution for enhancing stability in realistic mixed traffic environments. The code is made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Competition Helps: Achieving Optimal Traffic Flow with Multiple Autonomous Planners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07145v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inefficiency of selfish routing in congested networks is a classical problem in algorithmic game theory, often captured by the Price of Anarchy (i.e., the ratio between the social cost of decentralized decisions and that of a centrally optimized solution.) With the advent of autonomous vehicles, capable of receiving and executing centrally assigned routes, it is natural to ask whether their deployment can eliminate this inefficiency. At first glance, a central authority could simply compute an optimal traffic assignment and instruct each vehicle to follow its assigned path. However, this vision overlooks critical challenges: routes must be individually rational (no vehicle has an incentive to deviate), and in practice, multiple planning agents (e.g., different companies) may coexist and compete. Surprisingly, we show that such competition is not merely an obstacle but a necessary ingredient for achieving optimal outcomes. In this work, we design a routing mechanism that embraces competition and converges to an optimal assignment, starting from the classical Pigou network as a foundational case.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models are often task-oriented and are trained with tailored data, which limits their effectiveness in diverse mobile network tasks of Base Station (BS) deployment, resource allocation, energy optimization, etc. and hinders generalization across different urban environments. Foundation models have made remarkable strides across various domains of NLP and CV due to their multi-tasking adaption and zero/few-shot learning capabilities. In this paper, we propose an innovative Foundation model for Mo}bile traffic forecasting (FoMo), aiming to handle diverse forecasting tasks of short/long-term predictions and distribution generation across multiple cities to support network planning and optimization. FoMo combines diffusion models and transformers, where various spatio-temporal masks are proposed to enable FoMo to learn intrinsic features of different tasks, and a contrastive learning strategy is developed to capture the correlations between mobile traffic and urban contexts, thereby improving its transfer learning capability. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world datasets demonstrate that FoMo outperforms current models concerning diverse forecasting tasks and zero/few-shot learning, showcasing a strong universality.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, KDD 2025</p></details> |

While Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have shown benefits in modeling complex traffic dependencies, the existing GCN-based approaches cannot fully extract and fuse multi-granular spatiotemporal features across various spatial and temporal scales sufficiently in a complete manner, proven to yield less accurate results. Besides, as extracting multi-granular features across scales has been a promising strategy across domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, and time-series forecasting, pioneering studies have attempted to leverage a similar mechanism for spatiotemporal traffic data mining. However, additional feature extraction branches introduced in prior studies critically increased model complexity and extended inference time, making it challenging to provide fast forecasts. In this paper, we propose MultiGran-STGCNFog, an efficient fog distributed inference system with a novel traffic forecasting model that employs multi-granular spatiotemporal feature fusion on generated dynamic traffic graphs to fully capture interdependent traffic dynamics. The proposed scheduling algorithm GA-DPHDS, optimizing layer execution order and layer-device scheduling scheme simultaneously, contributes to considerable inference throughput improvement by coordinating heterogeneous fog devices in a pipelined manner. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over selected GCN baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 34th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Lightweight Auto-bidding based on Traffic Prediction in Live Advertising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06069v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Internet live streaming is widely used in online entertainment and e-commerce, where live advertising is an important marketing tool for anchors. An advertising campaign hopes to maximize the effect (such as conversions) under constraints (such as budget and cost-per-click). The mainstream control of campaigns is auto-bidding, where the performance depends on the decision of the bidding algorithm in each request. The most widely used auto-bidding algorithms include Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control, linear programming (LP), reinforcement learning (RL), etc. Existing methods either do not consider the entire time traffic, or have too high computational complexity. In this paper, the live advertising has high requirements for real-time bidding (second-level control) and faces the difficulty of unknown future traffic. Therefore, we propose a lightweight bidding algorithm Binary Constrained Bidding (BiCB), which neatly combines the optimal bidding formula given by mathematical analysis and the statistical method of future traffic estimation, and obtains good approximation to the optimal result through a low complexity solution. In addition, we complement the form of upper and lower bound constraints for traditional auto-bidding modeling and give theoretical analysis of BiCB. Sufficient offline and online experiments prove BiCB's good performance and low engineering cost.</p></details> |  |

Deep learning has advanced video-based traffic monitoring through video question answering (VideoQA) models, enabling structured insight extraction from traffic videos. However, existing VideoQA models struggle with the complexity of real-world traffic scenes, where multiple concurrent events unfold across spatiotemporal dimensions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \textbf{InterAct VideoQA}, a curated dataset designed to benchmark and enhance VideoQA models for traffic monitoring tasks. The InterAct VideoQA dataset comprises 8 hours of real-world traffic footage collected from diverse intersections, segmented into 10-second video clips, with over 25,000 question-answer (QA) pairs covering spatiotemporal dynamics, vehicle interactions, incident detection, and other critical traffic attributes. State-of-the-art VideoQA models are evaluated on InterAct VideoQA, exposing challenges in reasoning over fine-grained spatiotemporal dependencies within complex traffic scenarios. Additionally, fine-tuning these models on InterAct VideoQA yields notable performance improvements, demonstrating the necessity of domain-specific datasets for VideoQA. InterAct VideoQA is publicly available as a benchmark dataset to facilitate future research in real-world deployable VideoQA models for intelligent transportation systems.

| **[Spatio-Temporal Partial Sensing Forecast for Long-term Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02689v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting uses recent measurements by sensors installed at chosen locations to forecast the future road traffic. Existing work either assumes all locations are equipped with sensors or focuses on short-term forecast. This paper studies partial sensing forecast of long-term traffic, assuming sensors are available only at some locations. The problem is challenging due to the unknown data distribution at unsensed locations, the intricate spatio-temporal correlation in long-term forecasting, as well as noise to traffic patterns. We propose a Spatio-temporal Long-term Partial sensing Forecast model (SLPF) for traffic prediction, with several novel contributions, including a rank-based embedding technique to reduce the impact of noise in data, a spatial transfer matrix to overcome the spatial distribution shift from sensed locations to unsensed locations, and a multi-step training process that utilizes all available data to successively refine the model parameters for better accuracy. Extensive experiments on several real-world traffic datasets demonstrate its superior performance.

However, accurate forecasting is difficult due to intricate spatial and temporal patterns that exist due to the mobility of users. Existing AI-based traffic forecasting models often trade-off accuracy and computational efficiency. We present Hierarchical SpatioTemporal Mamba (HiSTM), which combines a dual spatial encoder with a Mamba-based temporal module and attention mechanism. HiSTM employs selective state space methods to capture spatial and temporal patterns in network traffic. In our evaluation, we use a real-world dataset to compare HiSTM against several baselines, showing a 29.4% MAE improvement over the STN baseline while using 94% fewer parameters. We show that the HiSTM generalizes well across different datasets and improves in accuracy over longer time-horizons.</p></details> |  |
| **[Channel-Independent Federated Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04517v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, traffic prediction has achieved remarkable success and has become an integral component of intelligent transportation systems. However, traffic data is typically distributed among multiple data owners, and privacy constraints prevent the direct utilization of these isolated datasets for traffic prediction. Most existing federated traffic prediction methods focus on designing communication mechanisms that allow models to leverage information from other clients in order to improve prediction accuracy. Unfortunately, such approaches often incur substantial communication overhead, and the resulting transmission delays significantly slow down the training process. As the volume of traffic data continues to grow, this issue becomes increasingly critical, making the resource consumption of current methods unsustainable. To address this challenge, we propose a novel variable relationship modeling paradigm for federated traffic prediction, termed the Channel-Independent Paradigm(CIP). Unlike traditional approaches, CIP eliminates the need for inter-client communication by enabling each node to perform efficient and accurate predictions using only local information. Based on the CIP, we further develop Fed-CI, an efficient federated learning framework, allowing each client to process its own data independently while effectively mitigating the information loss caused by the lack of direct data sharing among clients. Fed-CI significantly reduces communication overhead, accelerates the training process, and achieves state-of-the-art performance while complying with privacy regulations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that Fed-CI consistently outperforms existing methods across all datasets and federated settings. It achieves improvements of 8%, 14%, and 16% in RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, respectively, while also substantially reducing communication costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reconstructing Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Traffic Flow Modeling: a Multi-Gradient Descent and Pareto Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13241v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is crucial in modern traffic flow modeling because it combines the benefits of both physics-based and data-driven approaches. In conventional PIML, physical information is typically incorporated by constructing a hybrid loss function that combines data-driven loss and physics loss through linear scalarization. The goal is to find a trade-off between these two objectives to improve the accuracy of model predictions. However, from a mathematical perspective, linear scalarization is limited to identifying only the convex region of the Pareto front, as it treats data-driven and physics losses as separate objectives. Given that most PIML loss functions are non-convex, linear scalarization restricts the achievable trade-off solutions. Moreover, tuning the weighting coefficients for the two loss components can be both time-consuming and computationally challenging. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a paradigm shift in PIML by reformulating the training process as a multi-objective optimization problem, treating data-driven loss and physics loss independently. We apply several multi-gradient descent algorithms (MGDAs), including traditional multi-gradient descent (TMGD) and dual cone gradient descent (DCGD), to explore the Pareto front in this multi-objective setting. These methods are evaluated on both macroscopic and microscopic traffic flow models. In the macroscopic case, MGDAs achieved comparable performance to traditional linear scalarization methods. Notably, in the microscopic case, MGDAs significantly outperformed their scalarization-based counterparts, demonstrating the advantages of a multi-objective optimization approach in complex PIML scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Given the prohibitive computational cost of learning individual policies for each intersection, some researchers explore learning a universal policy to control each intersection in a decentralized manner, where the key challenge is to construct a universal representation method for heterogeneous intersections. However, existing methods are limited to universally representing information of heterogeneous ego intersections, neglecting the essential representation of influence from their heterogeneous neighbors. Universally incorporating neighborhood information is nontrivial due to the intrinsic complexity of traffic flow interactions, as well as the challenge of modeling collective influences from neighbor intersections. To address these challenges, we propose CityLight, which learns a universal policy based on representations obtained with two major modules: a Neighbor Influence Encoder to explicitly model neighbor's influence with specified traffic flow relation and connectivity to the ego intersection; a Neighbor Influence Aggregator to attentively aggregate the influence of neighbors based on their mutual competitive relations. Extensive experiments on five city-scale datasets, ranging from 97 to 13,952 intersections, confirm the efficacy of CityLight, with an average throughput improvement of 11.68% and a lift of 22.59% for generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |

We propose InfGen, a unified next-token prediction model that performs interleaved closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation. InfGen automatically switches between closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation mode. It enables stable long-term rollout simulation.

While most existing attacks exploit ML techniques for discovering such traffic patterns, they underperform on wireless traffic, especially Wi-Fi, due to its heavy noise and packet losses of wireless sniffing. In addition, these approaches commonly target at distinguishing chunked IoT event traffic samples, and they failed at effectively tracking multiple events simultaneously. In this work, we propose WiFinger, a fine-grained multi-IoT event fingerprinting approach against noisy traffic. WiFinger turns the traffic pattern classification task into a subsequence matching problem and introduces novel techniques to account for the high time complexity while maintaining high accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on Wi-Fi traffic, achieving an average recall of 85% (vs. 0.49% and 0.46%) for various IoT events while maintaining almost zero false positives for most of them.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIDAR: Mimicking LiDAR Detection for Traffic Applications with a Lightweight Plug-and-Play Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02858v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As autonomous driving (AD) technology advances, increasing research has focused on leveraging cooperative perception (CP) data collected from multiple AVs to enhance traffic applications. Due to the impracticality of large-scale real-world AV deployments, simulation has become the primary approach in most studies. While game-engine-based simulators like CARLA generate high-fidelity raw sensor data (e.g., LiDAR point clouds) which can be used to produce realistic detection outputs, they face scalability challenges in multi-AV scenarios. In contrast, microscopic traffic simulators such as SUMO scale efficiently but lack perception modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we propose MIDAR, a LiDAR detection mimicking model that approximates realistic LiDAR detections using vehicle-level features readily available from microscopic traffic simulators. Specifically, MIDAR predicts true positives (TPs) and false negatives (FNs) from ideal LiDAR detection results based on the spatial layouts and dimensions of surrounding vehicles. A Refined Multi-hop Line-of-Sight (RM-LoS) graph is constructed to encode the occlusion relationships among vehicles, upon which MIDAR employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP architecture to propagate features from the ego AV and occluding vehicles to the prediction target. MIDAR achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating the detection results generated by CenterPoint, a mainstream 3D LiDAR detection model, on the nuScenes AD dataset. Two CP-based traffic applications further validate the necessity of such realistic detection modeling, particularly for tasks requiring accurate individual vehicle observations (e.g., position, speed, lane index). As demonstrated in the applications, MIDAR can be seamlessly integrated into traffic simulators and trajectory datasets and will be open-sourced upon publication.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |

In this paper, we introduce Traffic-R1, a foundation model with human-like reasoning for TSC systems. Our model is developed through self-exploration and iteration of reinforced large language models (LLMs) with expert guidance in a simulated traffic environment. Compared to traditional reinforcement learning (RL) and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers three significant advantages. First, Traffic-R1 delivers zero-shot generalisation, transferring unchanged to new road networks and out-of-distribution incidents by utilizing its internal traffic control policies and human-like reasoning. Second, its 3B-parameter architecture is lightweight enough for real-time inference on mobile-class chips, enabling large-scale edge deployment. Third, Traffic-R1 provides an explainable TSC process and facilitates multi-intersection communication through its self-iteration and a new synchronous communication network. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that Traffic-R1 sets a new state of the art, outperforming strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In practice, the model now manages signals for more than 55,000 drivers daily, shortening average queues by over 5% and halving operator workload.

The advancement of deep learning has established pretrained models as a robust approach for this task. However, contemporary encrypted traffic classification systems face dual limitations. Firstly, pretrained models typically exhibit large-scale architectures, where their extensive parameterization results in slow inference speeds and high computational latency. Secondly, reliance on labeled data for fine-tuning restricts these models to predefined supervised classes, creating a bottleneck when novel traffic types emerge in the evolving Internet landscape. To address these challenges, we propose NetClus, a novel framework integrating pretrained models with distillation-enhanced clustering acceleration. During fine-tuning, NetClus first introduces a cluster-friendly loss to jointly reshape the latent space for both classification and clustering. With the fine-tuned model, it distills the model into a lightweight Feed-Forward Neural Network model to retain semantics. During inference, NetClus performs heuristic merge with near-linear runtime, and valid the cluster purity with newly proposed metrics ASI to identify emergent traffic types while expediting classification. Benchmarked against existing pretrained methods, NetClus achieves up to 6.2x acceleration while maintaining classification degradation below 1%.</p></details> | Under review |

When approaching a work zone, large trucks often need to merge into an adjacent lane because of lane closures caused by construction activities. This study aims to enhance the safety of large truck merging maneuvers in work zones by evaluating the risk associated with merging conflicts and establishing a decision-making strategy for merging based on this risk assessment. To predict the risk of large trucks merging into a mixed traffic stream within a work zone, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is employed. For a large truck intending to merge, it is critical that the immediate downstream vehicle in the target lane maintains a minimum safe gap to facilitate a safe merging process. Once a conflict-free merging opportunity is predicted, large trucks are instructed to merge in response to the lane closure. Our LSTM-based conflict prediction method is compared against baseline approaches, which include probabilistic risk-based merging, 50th percentile gap-based merging, and 85th percentile gap-based merging strategies. The results demonstrate that our method yields a lower conflict risk, as indicated by reduced Time Exposed Time-to-Collision (TET) and Time Integrated Time-to-Collision (TIT) values relative to the baseline models. Furthermore, the findings indicate that large trucks that use our method can perform early merging while still in motion, as opposed to coming to a complete stop at the end of the current lane prior to closure, which is commonly observed with the baseline approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Traffic Scene Generation from Natural Language Description for Autonomous Vehicles with Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09575v3)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating realistic and controllable traffic scenes from natural language can greatly enhance the development and evaluation of autonomous driving systems. However, this task poses unique challenges: (1) grounding free-form text into spatially valid and semantically coherent layouts, (2) composing scenarios without predefined locations, and (3) planning multi-agent behaviors and selecting roads that respect agents' configurations. To address these, we propose a modular framework, TTSG, comprising prompt analysis, road retrieval, agent planning, and a novel plan-aware road ranking algorithm to solve these challenges. While large language models (LLMs) are used as general planners, our design integrates them into a tightly controlled pipeline that enforces structure, feasibility, and scene diversity. Notably, our ranking strategy ensures consistency between agent actions and road geometry, enabling scene generation without predefined routes or spawn points. The framework supports both routine and safety-critical scenarios, as well as multi-stage event composition. Experiments on SafeBench demonstrate that our method achieves the lowest average collision rate (3.5\%) across three critical scenarios. Moreover, driving captioning models trained on our generated scenes improve action reasoning by over 30 CIDEr points. These results underscore our proposed framework for flexible, interpretable, and safety-oriented simulation.</p></details> |  |

Widely used datasets, such as Mapillary, often provide only coarse-grained labels - without distinguishing semantically important types such as stop signs or speed limit signs. To this end, we present a new validation set for traffic signs derived from the Mapillary dataset called Mapillary Vistas Validation for Traffic Signs (MVV), where we decompose composite traffic signs into granular, semantically meaningful categories. The dataset includes pixel-level instance masks and has been manually annotated by expert annotators to ensure label fidelity. Further, we benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs against the self-supervised DINOv2 model on this dataset and show that DINOv2 consistently outperforms all VLM baselines-not only on traffic sign recognition, but also on heavily represented categories like vehicles and humans. Our analysis reveals significant limitations in current vision-language models for fine-grained visual understanding and establishes DINOv2 as a strong baseline for dense semantic matching in autonomous driving scenarios.

| **[PRIME: Plasticity-Robust Incremental Model for Encrypted Traffic Classification in Dynamic Network Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02031v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the continuous development of network environments and technologies, ensuring cyber security and governance is increasingly challenging. Network traffic classification(ETC) can analyzes attributes such as application categories and malicious intent, supporting network management services like QoS optimization, intrusion detection, and targeted billing. As the prevalence of traffic encryption increases, deep learning models are relied upon for content-agnostic analysis of packet sequences. However, the emergence of new services and attack variants often leads to incremental tasks for ETC models. To ensure model effectiveness, incremental learning techniques are essential; however, recent studies indicate that neural networks experience declining plasticity as tasks increase. We identified plasticity issues in existing incremental learning methods across diverse traffic samples and proposed the PRIME framework. By observing the effective rank of model parameters and the proportion of inactive neurons, the PRIME architecture can appropriately increase the parameter scale when the model's plasticity deteriorates. Experiments show that in multiple encrypted traffic datasets and different category increment scenarios, the PRIME architecture performs significantly better than other incremental learning algorithms with minimal increase in parameter scale.</p></details> |  |

To reduce reliance on handcrafted features and labeled data, recent methods focus on learning generic representations through pre-training on large-scale unlabeled data. However, current pre-trained models face two limitations originating from the adopted Transformer architecture: (1) Limited model efficiency due to the self-attention mechanism with quadratic complexity; (2) Unstable traffic scalability to longer byte sequences, as the explicit positional encodings fail to generalize to input lengths not seen during pre-training. In this paper, we investigate whether convolutions, with linear complexity and implicit positional encoding, are competitive with Transformers in encrypted traffic classification with pre-training. We first conduct a systematic comparison, and observe that convolutions achieve higher efficiency and scalability, with lower classification performance. To address this trade-off, we propose NetConv, a novel pre-trained convolution model for encrypted traffic classification. NetConv employs stacked traffic convolution layers, which enhance the ability to capture localized byte-sequence patterns through window-wise byte scoring and sequence-wise byte gating. We design a continuous byte masking pre-training task to help NetConv learn protocol-specific patterns. Experimental results on four tasks demonstrate that NetConv improves average classification performance by 6.88% and model throughput by 7.41X over existing pre-trained models.</p></details> | Under review |

Many existing approaches adopt an SQL-based paradigm for querying such large-scale video databases; however, this constrains queries to rigid patterns with predefined semantic categories, significantly limiting analytical flexibility. In this work, we explore a language-driven video analytics paradigm aimed at enabling flexible and efficient querying of high-volume video data driven by natural language. Particularly, we build \textsc{Lava}, a system that accepts natural language queries and retrieves traffic targets across multiple levels of granularity and arbitrary categories. \textsc{Lava} comprises three main components: 1) a multi-armed bandit-based efficient sampling method for video segment-level localization; 2) a video-specific open-world detection module for object-level retrieval; and 3) a long-term object trajectory extraction scheme for temporal object association, yielding complete trajectories for object-of-interests. To support comprehensive evaluation, we further develop a novel benchmark by providing diverse, semantically rich natural language predicates and fine-grained annotations for multiple videos. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that \textsc{Lava} improves $F_1$-scores for selection queries by $\mathbf{14\%}$, reduces MPAE for aggregation queries by $\mathbf{0.39}$, and achieves top-$k$ precision of $\mathbf{86\%}$, while processing videos $ \mathbf{9.6\times} $ faster than the most accurate baseline.

| **[Embracing Large Language Models in Traffic Flow Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12201v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic flow forecasting aims to predict future traffic flows based on the historical traffic conditions and the road network. It is an important problem in intelligent transportation systems, with a plethora of methods been proposed. Existing efforts mainly focus on capturing and utilizing spatio-temporal dependencies to predict future traffic flows. Though promising, they fall short in adapting to test-time environmental changes of traffic conditions. To tackle this challenge, we propose to introduce large language models (LLMs) to help traffic flow forecasting and design a novel method named Large Language Model Enhanced Traffic Flow Predictor (LEAF). LEAF adopts two branches, capturing different spatio-temporal relations using graph and hypergraph structures respectively. The two branches are first pre-trained individually, and during test-time, they yield different predictions. Based on these predictions, a large language model is used to select the most likely result. Then, a ranking loss is applied as the learning objective to enhance the prediction ability of the two branches. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LEAF.</p></details> | Accepted by ACL 2025 |

Nevertheless, the telecom industry still heavily relies on manual expert intervention. Existing studies have been focused on exhaustively explore the spatial-temporal correlations. However, they often overlook the underlying characteristics of cellular traffic, which are shaped by the sporadic and bursty nature of telecom services. Additionally, concept drift creates substantial obstacles to maintaining satisfactory accuracy in continuous cellular forecasting tasks. To resolve these problems, we put forward an online cellular traffic prediction method grounded in Multi-Grained Spatial-Temporal feature Complementarity (MGSTC). The proposed method is devised to achieve high-precision predictions in practical continuous forecasting scenarios. Concretely, MGSTC segments historical data into chunks and employs the coarse-grained temporal attention to offer a trend reference for the prediction horizon. Subsequently, fine-grained spatial attention is utilized to capture detailed correlations among network elements, which enables localized refinement of the established trend. The complementarity of these multi-grained spatial-temporal features facilitates the efficient transmission of valuable information. To accommodate continuous forecasting needs, we implement an online learning strategy that can detect concept drift in real-time and promptly switch to the appropriate parameter update stage. Experiments carried out on four real-world datasets demonstrate that MGSTC outperforms eleven state-of-the-art baselines consistently.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ACM TKDD. 26 pages, 12 figures,</p></details> |

In reality, internet traffic is non-Markovian, and past states do influence routing performance. Moreover, common deep RL approaches use function approximators, such as neural networks, that do not model the spatial structure in network topologies. To address these shortcomings, we design a network environment with non-Markovian traffic and introduce a spatial-temporal RL (STRL) framework for packet routing. Our approach outperforms traditional baselines by more than 19% during training and 7% for inference despite a change in network topology.</p></details> |  |
| **[EP-Diffuser: An Efficient Diffusion Model for Traffic Scene Generation and Prediction via Polynomial Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05422v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the prediction horizon increases, predicting the future evolution of traffic scenes becomes increasingly difficult due to the multi-modal nature of agent motion. Most state-of-the-art (SotA) prediction models primarily focus on forecasting the most likely future. However, for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles, it is equally important to cover the distribution for plausible motion alternatives. To address this, we introduce EP-Diffuser, a novel parameter-efficient diffusion-based generative model designed to capture the distribution of possible traffic scene evolutions. Conditioned on road layout and agent history, our model acts as a predictor and generates diverse, plausible scene continuations. We benchmark EP-Diffuser against two SotA models in terms of accuracy and plausibility of predictions on the Argoverse 2 dataset. Despite its significantly smaller model size, our approach achieves both highly accurate and plausible traffic scene predictions. We further evaluate model generalization ability in an out-of-distribution (OoD) test setting using Waymo Open dataset and show superior robustness of our approach. The code and model checkpoints are available at: https://github.com/continental/EP-Diffuser.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Learning-Driven Traffic Sign Perception: Multi-Modal Fusion of Text and Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23331v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic sign recognition, as a core component of autonomous driving perception systems, directly influences vehicle environmental awareness and driving safety. Current technologies face two significant challenges: first, the traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution, resulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional convolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution classes; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small targets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract multi-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage framework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. For traffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable vision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to specifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For traffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal Contrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a Vision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL learns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating class confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method achieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for all-class recognition. The model also obtains 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall, significantly outperforming mainstream algorithms and demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization in complex, open-world scenarios.</p></details> | 11pages, 5 figures |

However, existing traffic simulation methods face challenges in their controllability. To address this, we propose a novel diffusion-based and LLM-enhanced traffic simulation framework. Our approach incorporates a high-level understanding module and a low-level refinement module, which systematically examines the hierarchical structure of traffic elements, guides LLMs to thoroughly analyze traffic scenario descriptions step by step, and refines the generation by self-reflection, enhancing their understanding of complex situations. Furthermore, we propose a Frenet-frame-based cost function framework that provides LLMs with geometrically meaningful quantities, improving their grasp of spatial relationships in a scenario and enabling more accurate cost function generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) demonstrate that our method can handle more intricate descriptions and generate a broader range of scenarios in a controllable manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |

Nevertheless, the complete potential of Green Wave systems has yet to be explored. Utilizing emerging technologies and advanced algorithms, such as AI or V2X, would aid in achieving more robust traffic management strategies, especially when integrated with Green Wave. This work comprehensively surveys existing traffic control strategies that enable Green Waves and analyzes their impact on future traffic management systems and urban infrastructure. Understanding previous research on traffic management and its effect on traffic efficiency and safety helps explore the integration of Green Wave solutions with smart city initiatives for effective traffic signal coordination. This paper also discusses the advantages of using Green Wave strategies for emission reduction and considers road safety issues for vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians and cyclists. Finally, the existing challenges and research gaps in building robust and successful Green Wave systems are discussed to articulate explicitly the future requirement of sustainable urban transport.</p></details> |  |

Autonomous driving technologies have emerged as a potential solution. Among traffic control methods, reinforcement learning has shown superior performance over traffic signals in various scenarios. However, prior research has largely focused on small-scale networks or isolated intersections, leaving large-scale mixed traffic control largely unexplored. This study presents the first attempt to use decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning for large-scale mixed traffic control in which some intersections are managed by traffic signals and others by robot vehicles. Evaluating a real-world network in Colorado Springs, CO, USA with 14 intersections, we measure traffic efficiency via average waiting time of vehicles at intersections and the number of vehicles reaching their destinations within a time window (i.e., throughput). At 80% RV penetration rate, our method reduces waiting time from 6.17s to 5.09s and increases throughput from 454 vehicles per 500 seconds to 493 vehicles per 500 seconds, outperforming the baseline of fully signalized intersections. These findings suggest that integrating reinforcement learning-based control large-scale traffic can improve overall efficiency and may inform future urban planning strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2025</p></details> |

However, as System Optimum makes some drivers better off than others, voluntary acceptance seems dubious. To overcome this issue, we propose a new concept of Wardropian cycles, which, in contrast to previous utopian visions, makes the assignment fair on top of being optimal, which amounts to satisfaction of both Wardrop's principles. Such cycles, represented as sequences of permutations to the daily assignment matrices, always exist and equalise, after a limited number of days, average travel times among travellers (like in User Equilibrium) while preserving everyday optimality of path flows (like in System Optimum). We propose exact methods to compute such cycles and reduce their length and within-cycle inconvenience to the users. As identification of optimal cycles turns out to be NP-hard in many aspects, we introduce a greedy heuristic efficiently approximating the optimal solution. Finally, we introduce and discuss a new paradigm of Cyclical User Equilibrium, which ensures stability of optimal Wardropian Cycles under unilateral deviations. We complement our theoretical study with large-scale simulations. In Barcelona, 670 vehicle-hours of Price-of-Anarchy are eliminated using cycles with a median length of 11 days-though 5% of cycles exceed 90 days. However, in Berlin, just five days of applying the greedy assignment rule significantly reduces initial inequity. In Barcelona, Anaheim, and Sioux Falls, less than 7% of the initial inequity remains after 10 days, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach in improving traffic performance with more ubiquitous social acceptability.</p></details> |  |

Recent LiDAR scene flow models utilize the rigid-motion assumption at the instance level, assuming objects are rigid bodies. However, these instance-level methods are not suitable for sparse radar point clouds. In this work, we present a novel Traffic-Aware Radar Scene-Flow (TARS) estimation method, which utilizes motion rigidity at the traffic level. To address the challenges in radar scene flow, we perform object detection and scene flow jointly and boost the latter. We incorporate the feature map from the object detector, trained with detection losses, to make radar scene flow aware of the environment and road users. From this, we construct a Traffic Vector Field (TVF) in the feature space to achieve holistic traffic-level scene understanding in our scene flow branch. When estimating the scene flow, we consider both point-level motion cues from point neighbors and traffic-level consistency of rigid motion within the space. TARS outperforms the state of the art on a proprietary dataset and the View-of-Delft dataset, improving the benchmarks by 23% and 15%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task, which aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using limited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task. This framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the Lane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies and distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained lane traffic states. Based on existing research, we designed several baseline models with the potential to solve the FRTI task and conducted extensive experiments on six datasets representing different road conditions to validate the effectiveness of the RoadDiff model in addressing the FRTI task. The relevant datasets and code are available at https://github.com/ShuhaoLii/RoadDiff.</p></details> |  |

However, the dynamic traffic flow forecasting is a highly nonlinear problem with complex temporal-spatial dependencies. Although the existing methods has provided great contributions to mine the temporal-spatial patterns in the complex traffic networks, they fail to encode the globally temporal-spatial patterns and are prone to overfit on the pre-defined geographical correlations, and thus hinder the model's robustness on the complex traffic environment. To tackle this issue, in this work, we proposed a multi-grained temporal-spatial graph learning framework to adaptively augment the globally temporal-spatial patterns obtained from a crafted graph transformer encoder with the local patterns from the graph convolution by a crafted gated fusion unit with residual connection techniques. Under these circumstances, our proposed model can mine the hidden global temporal-spatial relations between each monitor stations and balance the relative importance of local and global temporal-spatial patterns. Experiment results demonstrate the strong representation capability of our proposed method and our model consistently outperforms other strong baselines on various real-world traffic networks.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches often hinge on predefined driver models, objective optimization, or reliance on pre-recorded driving datasets, imposing limitations on their scalability, versatility, and adaptability. In this paper, we introduce TrafficMCTS, an innovative framework that harnesses the synergy of group-based Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and Social Value Orientation (SVO) to engender a multifaceted traffic flow with varying driving styles and cooperative tendencies. Anchored by a closed-loop architecture, our framework enables vehicles to dynamically adapt to their environment in real time, and ensure feasible collision-free trajectories. Through comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, we illuminate the advantages of our approach in terms of computational efficiency, planning success rate, intention completion time, and diversity metrics. Besides, we simulate multiple scenarios to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and highlight its ability to induce diverse social behaviors within the traffic flow. Finally, we validate the scalability of TrafficMCTS by demonstrating its capability to efficiently simulate diverse traffic scenarios involving numerous interacting vehicles within a complex road network, capturing the intricate dynamics of human-like driving behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> |

While the abundance of data has fueled significant breakthroughs, particularly in machine learning-based methods, it also raises concerns regarding privacy, cybersecurity, and data freshness. These issues can erode public trust in intelligent transportation systems. Recently, regulations have introduced the "right to be forgotten", allowing users to request the removal of their private data from models. As machine learning models can remember old data, simply removing it from back-end databases is insufficient in such systems. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel learning paradigm for TSEP-Machine Unlearning TSEP-which enables a trained TSEP model to selectively forget privacy-sensitive, poisoned, or outdated data. By empowering models to "unlearn," we aim to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of data-driven traffic TSEP.</p></details> |  |
| **[LSDM: LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model for Service-Level Mobile Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17795v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Service-level mobile traffic prediction for individual users is essential for network efficiency and quality of service enhancement. However, current prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model (LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions, showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in terms of the coefficient of determination. Compared to models of a similar type, such as CSDI, the root mean squared error can be reduced by at least 8.29%.

| **[Cross-domain Multi-step Thinking: Zero-shot Fine-grained Traffic Sign Recognition in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01534v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we propose Cross-domain Multi-step Thinking (CdMT) to improve zero-shot fine-grained traffic sign recognition (TSR) performance in the wild. Zero-shot fine-grained TSR in the wild is challenging due to the cross-domain problem between clean template traffic signs and real-world counterparts, and existing approaches particularly struggle with cross-country TSR scenarios, where traffic signs typically differ between countries. The proposed CdMT framework tackles these challenges by leveraging the multi-step reasoning capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs). We introduce context, characteristic, and differential descriptions to design multiple thinking processes for LMMs. Context descriptions, which are enhanced by center coordinate prompt optimization, enable the precise localization of target traffic signs in complex road images and filter irrelevant responses via novel prior traffic sign hypotheses. Characteristic descriptions, which are derived from in-context learning with template traffic signs, bridge cross-domain gaps and enhance fine-grained TSR. Differential descriptions refine the multimodal reasoning ability of LMMs by distinguishing subtle differences among similar signs. CdMT is independent of training data and requires only simple and uniform instructions, enabling it to achieve cross-country TSR. We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and two real-world datasets from different countries. The proposed CdMT framework achieved superior performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods on all five datasets, with recognition accuracies of 0.93, 0.89, 0.97, 0.89, and 0.85 on the GTSRB, BTSD, TT-100K, Sapporo, and Yokohama datasets, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published by Knowledge-Based Systems</p></details> |

All of them promise astonishing performance in encrypted traffic classification (up to 98% accuracy). In this paper, with a networking expert mindset, we critically reassess their performance. Through extensive analysis, we demonstrate that the reported successes are heavily influenced by data preparation problems, which allow these models to find easy shortcuts - spurious correlation between features and labels - during fine-tuning that unrealistically boost their performance. When such shortcuts are not present - as in real scenarios - these models perform poorly. We also introduce Pcap-Encoder, an LM-based representation learning model that we specifically design to extract features from protocol headers. Pcap-Encoder appears to be the only model that provides an instrumental representation for traffic classification. Yet, its complexity questions its applicability in practical settings. Our findings reveal flaws in dataset preparation and model training, calling for a better and more conscious test design.

To address this growing concern, we introduce Beacon, a naturalistic driving dataset capturing traffic dynamics during blackouts at two major intersections in Memphis, TN, USA. The dataset provides detailed traffic movements, including timesteps, origin, and destination lanes for each vehicle over four hours of peak periods. We analyze traffic demand, vehicle trajectories, and density across different scenarios, demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction under unsignalized, signalized, and mixed traffic conditions. We find that integrating robot vehicles (RVs) into traffic flow can substantially reduce intersection delays, with wait time improvements of up to 82.6%. However, this enhanced traffic efficiency comes with varying environmental impacts, as decreased vehicle idling may lead to higher overall CO2 emissions. To the best of our knowledge, Beacon is the first publicly available traffic dataset for naturalistic driving behaviors during blackouts at intersections.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Heterogeneous Mixed Traffic Control and Coordination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12330v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban intersections with diverse vehicle types, from small cars to large semi-trailers, pose significant challenges for traffic control. This study explores how robot vehicles (RVs) can enhance heterogeneous traffic flow, particularly at unsignalized intersections where traditional methods fail during power outages. Using reinforcement learning (RL) and real-world data, we simulate mixed traffic at complex intersections with RV penetration rates ranging from 10% to 90%. Results show that average waiting times drop by up to 86% and 91% compared to signalized and unsignalized intersections, respectively. We observe a "rarity advantage," where less frequent vehicles benefit the most (up to 87%). Although CO2 emissions and fuel consumption increase with RV penetration, they remain well below those of traditional signalized traffic. Decreased space headways also indicate more efficient road usage. These findings highlight RVs' potential to improve traffic efficiency and reduce environmental impact in complex, heterogeneous settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Variational Mode-Driven Graph Convolutional Network for Spatiotemporal Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16191v3)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on spatiotemporal (ST) traffic prediction using graph neural networks (GNNs). Given that ST data comprises non-stationary and complex temporal patterns, interpreting and predicting such trends is inherently challenging. Representing ST data in decomposed modes helps infer underlying behavior and assess the impact of noise on predictive performance. We propose a framework that decomposes ST data into interpretable modes using variational mode decomposition (VMD) and processes them through a neural network for future state forecasting. Unlike existing graph-based traffic forecasters that operate directly on raw or aggregated time series, the proposed hybrid approach, termed the Variational Mode Graph Convolutional Network (VMGCN), first decomposes non-stationary signals into interpretable variational modes by determining the optimal mode count via reconstruction-loss minimization and then learns both intramode and cross-mode spatiotemporal dependencies through a novel attention-augmented GCN. Additionally, we analyze the significance of each mode and the effect of bandwidth constraints on multi-horizon traffic flow predictions. The proposed two-stage design yields significant accuracy gains while providing frequency-level interpretability with demonstrated superior performance on the LargeST dataset for both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks. The implementation is publicly available on https://github.com/OsamaAhmad369/VMGCN.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM T...</summary><p>ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST) Submission, 2025</p></details> |

Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers an adaptive method for TSC by responding to dynamic traffic patterns, with multi-agent RL (MARL) gaining traction as intersections naturally function as coordinated agents. However, due to shifts in environmental dynamics, implementing MARL-based TSC policies in the real world often leads to a significant performance drop, known as the sim-to-real gap. Grounded Action Transformation (GAT) has successfully mitigated this gap in single-agent RL for TSC, but real-world traffic networks, which involve numerous interacting intersections, are better suited to a MARL framework. In this work, we introduce JL-GAT, an application of GAT to MARL-based TSC that balances scalability with enhanced grounding capability by incorporating information from neighboring agents. JL-GAT adopts a decentralized approach to GAT, allowing for the scalability often required in real-world traffic networks while still capturing key interactions between agents. Comprehensive experiments on various road networks under simulated adverse weather conditions, along with ablation studies, demonstrate the effectiveness of JL-GAT. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/DaRL-LibSignal/JL-GAT/.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted to RLC/RLJ 2025</p></details> |

With the cellular traffic demand increasing so dramatically, it is now necessary to accurately predict the user traffic in cellular networks, so as to improve the performance in terms of resource allocation and utilisation. Since traffic learning and prediction is a classical and appealing field, which still yields many meaningful results, there has been an increasing interest in leveraging Machine Learning tools to analyse the total traffic served in a given region, to optimise the operation of the network. With the help of this project, we seek to exploit the traffic history by using it to predict the nature and occurrence of future traffic. Furthermore, we classify the traffic into particular application types, to increase our understanding of the nature of the traffic. By leveraging the power of machine learning and identifying its usefulness in the field of cellular networks we try to achieve three main objectives - classification of the application generating the traffic, prediction of packet arrival intensity and burst occurrence. The design of the prediction and classification system is done using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model. The LSTM predictor developed in this experiment would return the number of uplink packets and also estimate the probability of burst occurrence in the specified future time interval. For the purpose of classification, the regression layer in our LSTM prediction model is replaced by a softmax classifier which is used to classify the application generating the cellular traffic into one of the four applications including surfing, video calling, voice calling, and video streaming.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |

Recent empirical approaches for analyzing traffic patterns have gained traction due to their applicability to city-scale policy development. However, conventional methodologies often rely on fragmented grid-based techniques, which may overlook critical interdependencies among spatial elements and temporal continuity. These limitations can compromise analytical effectiveness in complex urban environments. To address these challenges, we propose PriorMotion, a data integration framework designed to systematically uncover movement patterns through driving dynamics analysis. Our approach combines multi-scale empirical observations with customized analytical tools to capture evolving spatial-temporal trends in urban traffic. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PriorMotion significantly enhances analytical outcomes, including increased accuracy in traffic pattern analysis, improved adaptability to heterogeneous data environments, and reduced long-term projection errors. Validation confirms its effectiveness for urban infrastructure management applications requiring precise characterization of complex spatial-temporal interactions.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

This paper proposes Fourier Domain Adaptation (FDA), which requires only training data modifications without architectural changes, enabling effective adaptation to rainy and foggy conditions. FDA minimizes the domain gap between source and target domains, creating a dataset for reliable performance under adverse weather. The source domain merged LISA and S2TLD datasets, processed to address class imbalance. Established methods simulated rainy and foggy scenarios to form the target domain. Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) techniques were explored to leverage data more effectively, addressing the shortage of comprehensive datasets and poor performance of state-of-the-art models under hostile weather. Experimental results show FDA-augmented models outperform baseline models across mAP50, mAP50-95, Precision, and Recall metrics. YOLOv8 achieved a 12.25% average increase across all metrics. Average improvements of 7.69% in Precision, 19.91% in Recall, 15.85% in mAP50, and 23.81% in mAP50-95 were observed across all models, demonstrating FDA's effectiveness in mitigating adverse weather impact. These improvements enable real-world applications requiring reliable performance in challenging environmental conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2COOOL Workshop, ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, the traditional methods rely on standard graph structures often fail to capture the intricate higher-order spatio-temporal correlations inherent in real-world traffic dynamics. Standard graphs cannot fully represent the spatial relationships within road networks, which limits the effectiveness of graph-based approaches. In contrast, directed hypergraphs provide more accurate representation of spatial information to model complex directed relationships among multiple nodes. In this paper, we propose DHLight, a novel multi-agent policy-based framework that synergistically integrates directed hypergraph learning module. This framework introduces a novel dynamic directed hypergraph construction mechanism, which captures complex and evolving spatio-temporal relationships among intersections in road networks. By leveraging the directed hypergraph relational structure, DHLight empowers agents to achieve adaptive decision-making in traffic signal control. The effectiveness of DHLight is validated against state-of-the-art baselines through extensive experiments in various network datasets.

Relying solely on real-world driving scenes requires collecting massive datasets to capture these scenarios. While automatic generation of traffic scenarios appears promising, data-driven models require extensive training data and often lack fine-grained control over the output. Moreover, generating novel scenarios from scratch can introduce a distributional shift from the original training scenes which undermines the validity of evaluations especially for learning-based planners. To sidestep this, recent work proposes to generate challenging scenarios by augmenting original scenarios from the test set. However, this involves the manual augmentation of scenarios by domain experts. An approach that is unable to meet the demands for scale in the evaluation of self-driving systems. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel LLM-agent based framework for augmenting real-world traffic scenarios using natural language descriptions, addressing the limitations of existing methods. A key innovation is the use of an agentic design, enabling fine-grained control over the output and maintaining high performance even with smaller, cost-effective LLMs. Extensive human expert evaluation demonstrates our framework's ability to accurately adhere to user intent, generating high quality augmented scenarios comparable to those created manually.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional AI approaches often fail to capture the intricate spatial and temporal patterns that exist, due to e.g., the mobility of users. We introduce a lightweight, dual-path Spatiotemporal Network that leverages a Scalar LSTM (sLSTM) for efficient temporal modeling and a three-layer Conv3D module for spatial feature extraction. A fusion layer integrates both streams into a cohesive representation, enabling robust forecasting. Our design improves gradient stability and convergence speed while reducing prediction error. Evaluations on real-world datasets show superior forecast performance over ConvLSTM baselines and strong generalization to unseen regions, making it well-suited for large-scale, next-generation network deployments. Experimental evaluation shows a 23% MAE reduction over ConvLSTM, with a 30% improvement in model generalization.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we propose GraphTrafficGPT, a novel graph-based architecture, which fundamentally redesigns the task coordination process for LLM-driven traffic applications. GraphTrafficGPT represents tasks and their dependencies as nodes and edges in a directed graph, enabling efficient parallel execution and dynamic resource allocation. The main idea behind the proposed model is a Brain Agent that decomposes user queries, constructs optimized dependency graphs, and coordinates a network of specialized agents for data retrieval, analysis, visualization, and simulation. By introducing advanced context-aware token management and supporting concurrent multi-query processing, the proposed architecture handles interdependent tasks typical of modern urban mobility environments. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphTrafficGPT reduces token consumption by 50.2% and average response latency by 19.0% compared to TrafficGPT, while supporting simultaneous multi-query execution with up to 23.0% improvement in efficiency.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces an interpretable Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework to address this gap. Our attention-based model predicts the number of upcoming clearances, the instructions issued to aircraft by ATCOs, from interactions within static traffic scenarios. Crucially, we derive an interpretable, per-aircraft task demand score by systematically ablating aircraft and measuring the impact on the model's predictions. Our framework significantly outperforms an ATCO-inspired heuristic and is a more reliable estimator of scenario complexity than established baselines. The resulting tool can attribute task demand to specific aircraft, offering a new way to analyse and understand the drivers of complexity for applications in controller training and airspace redesign.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Author Accepted Manuscript version of paper at the AIAA AVIATION Forum 2025</p></details> |

This paper proposes the Tree-like Pairwise Interaction Network (PIN), a novel neural network architecture that explicitly captures pairwise feature interactions through a shared feed-forward neural network architecture that mimics the structure of decision trees. PIN enables intrinsic interpretability by design, allowing for direct inspection of interaction effects. Moreover, it allows for efficient SHapley's Additive exPlanation (SHAP) computations because it only involves pairwise interactions. We highlight connections between PIN and established models such as GA2Ms, gradient boosting machines, and graph neural networks. Empirical results on the popular French motor insurance dataset show that PIN outperforms both traditional and modern neural networks benchmarks in predictive accuracy, while also providing insight into how features interact with each another and how they contribute to the predictions.</p></details> |  |

With the growing adoption of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), CFG-based representations have proven highly effective for malware detection. This study proposes a novel framework that dynamically constructs CFGs and embeds node features using a hybrid approach combining rule-based encoding and autoencoder-based embedding. A GNN-based classifier is then constructed to detect malicious behavior from the resulting graph representations. To improve model interpretability, we apply state-of-the-art explainability techniques, including GNNExplainer, PGExplainer, and CaptumExplainer, the latter is utilized three attribution methods: Integrated Gradients, Guided Backpropagation, and Saliency. In addition, we introduce a novel aggregation method, called RankFusion, that integrates the outputs of the top-performing explainers to enhance the explanation quality. We also evaluate explanations using two subgraph extraction strategies, including the proposed Greedy Edge-wise Composition (GEC) method for improved structural coherence. A comprehensive evaluation using accuracy, fidelity, and consistency metrics demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of accurate identification of malware samples and generating reliable and interpretable explanations.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, their computational complexity and irregular memory access patterns pose significant challenges for deployment on FPGAs in hardware trigger systems, where strict latency and resource constraints apply. In this work, we propose JEDI-linear, a novel GNN architecture with linear computational complexity that eliminates explicit pairwise interactions by leveraging shared transformations and global aggregation. To further enhance hardware efficiency, we introduce fine-grained quantization-aware training with per-parameter bitwidth optimization and employ multiplier-free multiply-accumulate operations via distributed arithmetic. Evaluation results show that our FPGA-based JEDI-linear achieves 3.7 to 11.5 times lower latency, up to 150 times lower initiation interval, and up to 6.2 times lower LUT usage compared to state-of-the-art designs while also delivering higher model accuracy and eliminating the need for DSP blocks entirely. In contrast, state-of-the-art solutions consume over 8,700 DSPs. This is the first interaction-based GNN to achieve less than 60~ns latency and currently meets the requirements for use in the HL-LHC CMS Level-1 trigger system. This work advances the next-generation trigger systems by enabling accurate, scalable, and resource-efficient GNN inference in real-time environments. Our open-sourced templates will further support reproducibility and broader adoption across scientific applications.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |

Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and tested on different datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, their black-box nature reduces interpretability, which limits trust in their predictions for important applications such as drug discovery and materials design. Furthermore, existing explanation techniques often fail to reliably quantify the contribution of individual atoms or substructures due to the entangled message-passing dynamics. We introduce SEAL (Substructure Explanation via Attribution Learning), a new interpretable graph neural network that attributes model predictions to meaningful molecular subgraphs. SEAL decomposes input graphs into chemically relevant fragments and estimates their causal influence on the output. The strong alignment between fragment contributions and model predictions is achieved by explicitly reducing inter-fragment message passing in our proposed model architecture. Extensive evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world molecular datasets demonstrate that SEAL outperforms other explainability methods in both quantitative attribution metrics and human-aligned interpretability. A user study further confirms that SEAL provides more intuitive and trustworthy explanations to domain experts. By bridging the gap between predictive performance and interpretability, SEAL offers a promising direction for more transparent and actionable molecular modeling.</p></details> |  |

The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification.

However, similar to other machine learning models, GNNs can exhibit bias in predictions based on attributes like race and gender. Moreover, bias in GNNs can be exacerbated by the graph structure and message-passing mechanisms. Recent cutting-edge methods propose mitigating bias by filtering out sensitive information from input or representations, like edge dropping or feature masking. Yet, we argue that such strategies may unintentionally eliminate non-sensitive features, leading to a compromised balance between predictive accuracy and fairness. To tackle this challenge, we present a novel approach utilizing counterfactual data augmentation for bias mitigation. This method involves creating diverse neighborhoods using counterfactuals before message passing, facilitating unbiased node representations learning from the augmented graph. Subsequently, an adversarial discriminator is employed to diminish bias in predictions by conventional GNN classifiers. Our proposed technique, Fair-ICD, ensures the fairness of GNNs under moderate conditions. Experiments on standard datasets using three GNN backbones demonstrate that Fair-ICD notably enhances fairness metrics while preserving high predictive performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 2024 KDD Workshop</p></details> |

The key challenge in graph density estimation lies in effectively capturing both structural patterns and semantic variations while maintaining theoretical guarantees. Combining graph kernels and kernel density estimation (KDE) is a standard approach to graph density estimation, but has unsatisfactory performance due to the handcrafted and fixed features of kernels. Our method LGKDE leverages graph neural networks to represent each graph as a discrete distribution and utilizes maximum mean discrepancy to learn the graph metric for multi-scale KDE, where all parameters are learned by maximizing the density of graphs relative to the density of their well-designed perturbed counterparts. The perturbations are conducted on both node features and graph spectra, which helps better characterize the boundary of normal density regions. Theoretically, we establish consistency and convergence guarantees for LGKDE, including bounds on the mean integrated squared error, robustness, and complexity. We validate LGKDE by demonstrating its effectiveness in recovering the underlying density of synthetic graph distributions and applying it to graph anomaly detection across diverse benchmark datasets. Extensive empirical evaluation shows that LGKDE demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines on most benchmark datasets.</p></details> | Under Review |

These models feature uniqueness in efficient computation as well as rich expressiveness, which stems from advanced management and profound understanding of graph data. However, few systematic studies have been conducted to assess spectral GNNs, particularly in benchmarking their efficiency, memory consumption, and effectiveness in a unified and fair manner. There is also a pressing need to select spectral models suitable for learning specific graph data and deploying them to massive web-scale graphs, which is currently constrained by the varied model designs and training settings. In this work, we extensively benchmark spectral GNNs with a focus on the spectral perspective, demystifying them as spectral graph filters. We analyze and categorize 35 GNNs with 27 corresponding filters, spanning diverse formulations and utilizations of the graph data. Then, we implement the filters within a unified spectral-oriented framework with dedicated graph computations and efficient training schemes. In particular, our implementation enables the deployment of spectral GNNs over million-scale graphs and various tasks with comparable performance and less overhead. Thorough experiments are conducted on the graph filters with comprehensive metrics on effectiveness and efficiency, offering novel observations and practical guidelines that are only available from our evaluations across graph scales. Different from the prevailing belief, our benchmark reveals an intricate landscape regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of spectral graph filters, demonstrating the potential to achieve desirable performance through tailored spectral manipulation of graph data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report with Appendix.

It also incorporates a Transformer architecture to model dynamic temporal features during disease progression. To fuse structural and temporal information, a structure-aware gating mechanism is designed to dynamically adjust the fusion weights between structural encodings and temporal features, enhancing the model's ability to identify key progression stages. To improve classification accuracy and stability, the framework includes a multi-component modeling pipeline, consisting of a graph construction module, a temporal encoding module, and a prediction output layer. The model is evaluated on real-world longitudinal Parkinson's disease data. The experiments involve comparisons with mainstream models, sensitivity analysis of hyperparameters, and graph connection density control. Results show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in AUC, RMSE, and IPW-F1 metrics. It effectively distinguishes progression stages and improves the model's ability to capture personalized symptom trajectories. The overall framework demonstrates strong generalization and structural scalability, providing reliable support for intelligent modeling of chronic progressive diseases such as Parkinson's disease.</p></details> |  |

It proposes a fine-tuning algorithm framework based on knowledge graph injection. The method builds on pretrained language models and introduces structured graph information for auxiliary learning. A graph neural network is used to encode entities and their relations, constructing a graph-based semantic representation. A fusion mechanism is then designed to jointly model the knowledge graph embeddings with the contextual representations from the language model. To enhance the robustness of knowledge integration, a gating mechanism is introduced to dynamically balance the contributions of linguistic semantics and structural knowledge. This effectively mitigates conflicts between different representational spaces. During training, a joint loss function is constructed to account for both task performance and structural alignment objectives. This helps improve the accuracy of entity prediction and semantic reasoning. The study also includes a series of systematic sensitivity experiments. It evaluates the effects of learning rate, graph coverage, and structural perturbations on model performance. The results further validate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed method across tasks such as entity recognition, question answering, and language generation. Experimental findings show that the proposed structure-aware fine-tuning framework significantly enhances the model's ability to represent complex semantic units. It demonstrates better semantic consistency and contextual logic modeling in scenarios involving structural reasoning and entity extraction.</p></details> |  |

Existing theoretical studies on the learning dynamics of GNNs primarily focus on the convergence rates of learning algorithms under the interpolation regime (noise-free) and offer only a crude connection between these dynamics and the actual graph structure (e.g., maximum degree). This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the excessive risk (generalization performance) of learning algorithms in GNNs within the generalization regime (with noise). Specifically, we extend the conventional settings from the learning theory literature to the context of GNNs and examine how graph structure influences the performance of learning algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Ridge regression. Our study makes several key contributions toward understanding the interplay between graph structure and learning in GNNs. First, we derive the excess risk profiles of SGD and Ridge regression in GNNs and connect these profiles to the graph structure through spectral graph theory. With this established framework, we further explore how different graph structures (regular vs. power-law) impact the performance of these algorithms through comparative analysis. Additionally, we extend our analysis to multi-layer linear GNNs, revealing an increasing non-isotropic effect on the excess risk profile, thereby offering new insights into the over-smoothing issue in GNNs from the perspective of learning algorithms. Our empirical results align with our theoretical predictions, \emph{collectively showcasing a coupling relation among graph structure, GNNs and learning algorithms, and providing insights on GNN algorithm design and selection in practice.}</p></details> |  |

In contrast to their vast potential, training them on large-scale graphs presents significant computational challenges due to the resources required for their storage and processing. Graph Condensation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce these demands by learning a synthetic compact graph that preserves the essential information of the original one while maintaining the GNN's predictive performance. Despite their efficacy, current graph condensation approaches frequently rely on a computationally intensive bi-level optimization. Moreover, they fail to maintain a mapping between synthetic and original nodes, limiting the interpretability of the model's decisions. In this sense, a wide range of decomposition techniques have been applied to learn linear or multi-linear functions from graph data, offering a more transparent and less resource-intensive alternative. However, their applicability to graph condensation remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap and proposes a novel method called Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition (GCTD) to investigate to what extent such techniques can synthesize an informative smaller graph and achieve comparable downstream task performance. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GCTD effectively reduces graph size while preserving GNN performance, achieving up to a 4.0\ improvement in accuracy on three out of six datasets and competitive performance on large graphs compared to existing approaches.

This work proposes ReviewGraph for Review Rating Prediction (RRP), a novel framework that transforms textual customer reviews into knowledge graphs by extracting (subject, predicate, object) triples and associating sentiment scores. Using graph embeddings (Node2Vec) and sentiment features, the framework predicts review rating scores through machine learning classifiers. We compare ReviewGraph performance with traditional NLP baselines (such as Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec) and large language models (LLMs), evaluating them in the HotelRec dataset. In comparison to the state of the art literature, our proposed model performs similar to their best performing model but with lower computational cost (without ensemble). While ReviewGraph achieves comparable predictive performance to LLMs and outperforms baselines on agreement-based metrics such as Cohen's Kappa, it offers additional advantages in interpretability, visual exploration, and potential integration into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This work highlights the potential of graph-based representations for enhancing review analytics and lays the groundwork for future research integrating advanced graph neural networks and fine-tuned LLM-based extraction methods. We will share ReviewGraph output and platform open-sourced on our GitHub page https://github.com/aaronlifenghan/ReviewGraph</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Up without Fading Out: Goal-Aware Sparse GNN for RL-based Generalized Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10747v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalized planning using deep reinforcement learning (RL) combined with graph neural networks (GNNs) has shown promising results in various symbolic planning domains described by PDDL. However, existing approaches typically represent planning states as fully connected graphs, leading to a combinatorial explosion in edge information and substantial sparsity as problem scales grow, especially evident in large grid-based environments. This dense representation results in diluted node-level information, exponentially increases memory requirements, and ultimately makes learning infeasible for larger-scale problems. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse, goal-aware GNN representation that selectively encodes relevant local relationships and explicitly integrates spatial features related to the goal. We validate our approach by designing novel drone mission scenarios based on PDDL within a grid world, effectively simulating realistic mission execution environments. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method scales effectively to larger grid sizes previously infeasible with dense graph representations and substantially improves policy generalization and success rates. Our findings provide a practical foundation for addressing realistic, large-scale generalized planning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Refining Contrastive Learning and Homography Relations for Multi-Modal Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13745v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal recommender system focuses on utilizing rich modal information ( i.e., images and textual descriptions) of items to improve recommendation performance. The current methods have achieved remarkable success with the powerful structure modeling capability of graph neural networks. However, these methods are often hindered by sparse data in real-world scenarios. Although contrastive learning and homography ( i.e., homogeneous graphs) are employed to address the data sparsity challenge, existing methods still suffer two main limitations: 1) Simple multi-modal feature contrasts fail to produce effective representations, causing noisy modal-shared features and loss of valuable information in modal-unique features; 2) The lack of exploration of the homograph relations between user interests and item co-occurrence results in incomplete mining of user-item interplay. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for \textbf{R}\textbf{E}fining multi-mod\textbf{A}l cont\textbf{R}astive learning and ho\textbf{M}ography relations (\textbf{REARM}). Specifically, we complement multi-modal contrastive learning by employing meta-network and orthogonal constraint strategies, which filter out noise in modal-shared features and retain recommendation-relevant information in modal-unique features. To mine homogeneous relationships effectively, we integrate a newly constructed user interest graph and an item co-occurrence graph with the existing user co-occurrence and item semantic graphs for graph learning. The extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of REARM to various state-of-the-art baselines. Our visualization further shows an improvement made by REARM in distinguishing between modal-shared and modal-unique features.

However, the scalability of full-batch GNN training becomes severely limited by high communication overhead and load imbalance in distributed environments. In this paper, we present CaPGNN, a novel framework for efficient parallel full-batch GNN training on single-server with multi-GPU, designed specifically to reduce redundant inter-GPU communication and balance computational workloads. We propose a joint adaptive caching algorithm that leverages both CPU and GPU memory to significantly reduce the repetitive transmission of vertex features across partitions. Additionally, we introduce a resource-aware graph partitioning algorithm that adjusts subgraph sizes dynamically according to the heterogeneous computational and communication capacities of GPUs. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate that CaPGNN effectively reduces communication costs by up to 96% and accelerates GNN training by up to 12.7 times compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Our results highlight the potential of adaptive caching and resource-aware partitioning to facilitate scalable, efficient, and practical deployment of full-batch GNN training in distributed computing environments.</p></details> |  |

However, existing directed graph neural networks often struggle to jointly capture directional semantics and global structural patterns due to their isotropic aggregation mechanisms and localized filtering mechanisms. To address this limitation, this paper proposes SVDformer, a novel framework that synergizes SVD and Transformer architecture for direction-aware graph representation learning. SVDformer first refines singular value embeddings through multi-head self-attention, adaptively enhancing critical spectral components while suppressing high-frequency noise. This enables learnable low-pass/high-pass graph filtering without requiring spectral kernels. Furthermore, by treating singular vectors as directional projection bases and singular values as scaling factors, SVDformer uses the Transformer to model multi-scale interactions between incoming/outgoing edge patterns through attention weights, thereby explicitly preserving edge directionality during feature propagation. Extensive experiments on six directed graph benchmarks demonstrate that SVDformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and direction-aware baselines on node classification tasks, establishing a new paradigm for learning representations on directed graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[LOOP: A Plug-and-Play Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Enhancing Planning in Autonomous Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13371v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning is one of the most critical tasks in autonomous systems, where even a small error can lead to major failures or million-dollar losses. Current state-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains, producing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and hallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack the flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for modern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot translation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for neural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To address this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework that treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic components rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated neural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships, multi-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical decomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from both successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL specifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds a causal knowledge base from execution traces. LOOP was evaluated on six standard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared to LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%). This work shows that the key to reliable planning is not in choosing between neural networks or symbolic reasoners but it lies in making them actually ``talk'' to each other during the entire process. LOOP provides a thorough blueprint for building autonomous systems that can finally be trusted with critical real-world applications.</p></details> | Submitted to IAAI-26 |

Given a hierarchical representation of the environment, the objective is to navigate from a start position to a goal, while satisfying task-specific safety constraints and minimizing computational cost. We introduce Hierarchical Class-ordered A* (HCOA*), an algorithm that leverages the environment's hierarchy for efficient and safe path-planning in mixed geometric/semantic graphs. We use a total order over the semantic classes and prove theoretical performance guarantees for the algorithm. We propose three approaches for higher-layer node classification based on the semantics of the lowest layer: a Graph Neural Network method, a k-Nearest Neighbors method, and a Majority-Class method. We evaluate HCOA* in simulations on two 3D Scene Graphs, comparing it to the state-of-the-art and assessing the performance of each classification approach. Results show that HCOA* reduces the computational time of navigation by up to 50%, while maintaining near-optimal performance across a wide range of scenarios.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[GraphLand: Evaluating Graph Machine Learning Models on Diverse Industrial Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14500v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although data that can be naturally represented as graphs is widespread in real-world applications across diverse industries, popular graph ML benchmarks for node property prediction only cover a surprisingly narrow set of data domains, and graph neural networks (GNNs) are often evaluated on just a few academic citation networks. This issue is particularly pressing in light of the recent growing interest in designing graph foundation models. These models are supposed to be able to transfer to diverse graph datasets from different domains, and yet the proposed graph foundation models are often evaluated on a very limited set of datasets from narrow applications. To alleviate this issue, we introduce GraphLand: a benchmark of 14 diverse graph datasets for node property prediction from a range of different industrial applications. GraphLand allows evaluating graph ML models on a wide range of graphs with diverse sizes, structural characteristics, and feature sets, all in a unified setting. Further, GraphLand allows investigating such previously underexplored research questions as how realistic temporal distributional shifts under transductive and inductive settings influence graph ML model performance. To mimic realistic industrial settings, we use GraphLand to compare GNNs with gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT) models that are popular in industrial applications and show that GBDTs provided with additional graph-based input features can sometimes be very strong baselines. Further, we evaluate currently available general-purpose graph foundation models and find that they fail to produce competitive results on our proposed datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoTO: Robust Topology Obfuscation Against Tomography Inference Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12852v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tomography inference attacks aim to reconstruct network topology by analyzing end-to-end probe delays. Existing defenses mitigate these attacks by manipulating probe delays to mislead inference, but rely on two strong assumptions: (i) probe packets can be perfectly detected and altered, and (ii) attackers use known, fixed inference algorithms. These assumptions often break in practice, leading to degraded defense performance under detection errors or adaptive adversaries. We present RoTO, a robust topology obfuscation scheme that eliminates both assumptions by modeling uncertainty in attacker-observed delays through a distributional formulation. RoTO casts the defense objective as a min-max optimization problem that maximizes expected topological distortion across this uncertainty set, without relying on perfect probe control or specific attacker models. To approximate attacker behavior, RoTO leverages graph neural networks for inference simulation and adversarial training. We also derive an upper bound on attacker success probability, and demonstrate that our approach enhances topology obfuscation performance through the optimization of this upper bound. Experimental results show that RoTO outperforms existing defense methods, achieving average improvements of 34% in structural similarity and 42.6% in link distance while maintaining strong robustness and concealment capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Multi-Agent Epistemic Planning through GNN-Derived Heuristics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12840v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent Epistemic Planning (MEP) is an autonomous planning framework for reasoning about both the physical world and the beliefs of agents, with applications in domains where information flow and awareness among agents are critical. The richness of MEP requires states to be represented as Kripke structures, i.e., directed labeled graphs. This representation limits the applicability of existing heuristics, hindering the scalability of epistemic solvers, which must explore an exponential search space without guidance, resulting often in intractability. To address this, we exploit Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn patterns and relational structures within epistemic states, to guide the planning process. GNNs, which naturally capture the graph-like nature of Kripke models, allow us to derive meaningful estimates of state quality -- e.g., the distance from the nearest goal -- by generalizing knowledge obtained from previously solved planning instances. We integrate these predictive heuristics into an epistemic planning pipeline and evaluate them against standard baselines, showing significant improvements in the scalability of multi-agent epistemic planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Modeling of Full-Atom Protein Conformations using Latent Diffusion on Graph Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17064v4)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating diverse, all-atom conformational ensembles of dynamic proteins such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is critical for understanding their function, yet most generative models simplify atomic detail or ignore conformational diversity altogether. We present latent diffusion for full protein generation (LD-FPG), a framework that constructs complete all-atom protein structures, including every side-chain heavy atom, directly from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph neural network (ChebNet) to obtain low-dimensional latent embeddings of protein conformations, which are processed using three pooling strategies: blind, sequential and residue-based. A diffusion model trained on these latent representations generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized by dihedral-angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates. Using D2R-MD, a 2-microsecond MD trajectory (12 000 frames) of the human dopamine D2 receptor in a membrane environment, the sequential and residue-based pooling strategy reproduces the reference ensemble with high structural fidelity (all-atom lDDT of approximately 0.7; C-alpha-lDDT of approximately 0.8) and recovers backbone and side-chain dihedral-angle distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence of less than 0.03 compared to the MD data. LD-FPG thereby offers a practical route to system-specific, all-atom ensemble generation for large proteins, providing a promising tool for structure-based therapeutic design on complex, dynamic targets. The D2R-MD dataset and our implementation are freely available to facilitate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (main text), 4 figures, 2 tables.

| **[S2FGL: Spatial Spectral Federated Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02409v4)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Graph Learning (FGL) combines the privacy-preserving capabilities of federated learning (FL) with the strong graph modeling capability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Current research addresses subgraph-FL from the structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label signals and a degradation in the semantic knowledge of the global GNN. From a spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drift occurs, undermining global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global knowledge repository to mitigate the challenge of poor semantic knowledge caused by label signal disruption. Furthermore, we design a frequency alignment to address spectral client drift. The combination of Spatial and Spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL. The code is available at https://github.com/Wonder7racer/S2FGL.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[MPOCryptoML: Multi-Pattern based Off-Chain Crypto Money Laundering Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12641v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in money laundering detection have demonstrated the potential of using graph neural networks to capture laundering patterns accurately. However, existing models are not explicitly designed to detect the diverse patterns of off-chain cryptocurrency money laundering. Neglecting any laundering pattern introduces critical detection gaps, as each pattern reflects unique transactional structures that facilitate the obfuscation of illicit fund origins and movements. Failure to account for these patterns may result in under-detection or omission of specific laundering activities, diminishing model accuracy and allowing schemes to bypass detection. To address this gap, we propose the MPOCryptoML model to effectively detect multiple laundering patterns in cryptocurrency transactions. MPOCryptoML includes the development of a multi-source Personalized PageRank algorithm to identify random laundering patterns. Additionally, we introduce two novel algorithms by analyzing the timestamp and weight of transactions in high-volume financial networks to detect various money laundering structures, including fan-in, fan-out, bipartite, gather-scatter, and stack patterns. We further examine correlations between these patterns using a logistic regression model. An anomaly score function integrates results from each module to rank accounts by anomaly score, systematically identifying high-risk accounts. Extensive experiments on public datasets including Elliptic++, Ethereum fraud detection, and Wormhole transaction datasets validate the efficacy and efficiency of MPOCryptoML. Results show consistent performance gains, with improvements up to 9.13% in precision, up to 10.16% in recall, up to 7.63% in F1-score, and up to 10.19% in accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Toward this goal, significant effort has focused on developing models that jointly sample molecular topology and 3D structure. We present FlowMol3, an open-source, multi-modal flow matching model that advances the state of the art for all-atom, small-molecule generation. Its substantial performance gains over previous FlowMol versions are achieved without changes to the graph neural network architecture or the underlying flow matching formulation. Instead, FlowMol3's improvements arise from three architecture-agnostic techniques that incur negligible computational cost: self-conditioning, fake atoms, and train-time geometry distortion. FlowMol3 achieves nearly 100% molecular validity for drug-like molecules with explicit hydrogens, more accurately reproduces the functional group composition and geometry of its training data, and does so with an order of magnitude fewer learnable parameters than comparable methods. We hypothesize that these techniques mitigate a general pathology affecting transport-based generative models, enabling detection and correction of distribution drift during inference. Our results highlight simple, transferable strategies for improving the stability and quality of diffusion- and flow-based molecular generative models.</p></details> |  |

Central to this effort is the development of invariant and equivariant operations. This works presents a systematic method for constructing valid invariant and equivariant operations. It can handle inputs and outputs in the form of Cartesian tensors with different rank, as well as spherical tensors with different types. In addition, our method features a graphical representation utilizing the symmetric tensor network, which simplifies both the proofs and constructions related to invariant and equivariant functions. We also apply this approach to design the equivariant interaction message for the geometry graph neural network, and equivariant machine learning model to learn the constitutive law of materials.</p></details> |  |

While prior methods rely on invasive signals such as electroencephalography (EEG) for high predictive accuracy, these approaches require specialized hardware and are impractical for real-world applications. In this work, we propose a scalable, deployable framework for personalized cybersickness prediction leveraging only non-invasive signals readily available from commercial VR headsets, including head motion, eye tracking, and physiological responses. Our model employs a modality-specific graph neural network enhanced with a Difference Attention Module to extract temporal-spatial embeddings capturing dynamic changes across modalities. A cross-modal alignment module jointly trains the video encoder to learn personalized traits by aligning video features with sensor-derived representations. Consequently, the model accurately predicts individual cybersickness using only video input during inference. Experimental results show our model achieves 88.4\% accuracy, closely matching EEG-based approaches (89.16\%), while reducing deployment complexity. With an average inference latency of 90ms, our framework supports real-time applications, ideal for integration into consumer-grade VR platforms without compromising personalization or performance.

In contrast, unsigned graph structures are abundant and can be readily leveraged to pre-train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offering a promising solution to reduce supervision requirements in downstream signed graph tasks. However, transferring knowledge from unsigned to signed graphs is non-trivial due to the fundamental discrepancies in graph types and task objectives between pre-training and downstream phases. To address this challenge, we propose Signed Graph Prompt Tuning (SGPT), a novel graph prompting framework that adapts pre-trained unsigned GNNs to few-shot signed graph tasks. We first design a graph template based on balance theory to disentangle mixed node relationships introduced by negative links, mitigating the structural mismatches between unsigned and signed graphs. We further introduce a task template that reformulates downstream signed tasks into a unified link prediction objective, aligning their optimization goals with the pre-training task. Furthermore, we develop feature prompts that align downstream semantic spaces with the feature spaces learned during pre-training, and semantic prompts to integrate link sign semantics in a task-aware manner. We conduct extensive experiments on seven benchmark signed graph datasets, demonstrating that SGPT significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, establishing a powerful and generalizable solution for few-shot signed graph learning.</p></details> | CIKM'25 |
| **[CRoC: Context Refactoring Contrast for Graph Anomaly Detection with Limited Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12278v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used as the engine for various graph-related tasks, with their effectiveness in analyzing graph-structured data. However, training robust GNNs often demands abundant labeled data, which is a critical bottleneck in real-world applications. This limitation severely impedes progress in Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD), where anomalies are inherently rare, costly to label, and may actively camouflage their patterns to evade detection. To address these problems, we propose Context Refactoring Contrast (CRoC), a simple yet effective framework that trains GNNs for GAD by jointly leveraging limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. Different from previous works, CRoC exploits the class imbalance inherent in GAD to refactor the context of each node, which builds augmented graphs by recomposing the attributes of nodes while preserving their interaction patterns. Furthermore, CRoC encodes heterogeneous relations separately and integrates them into the message-passing process, enhancing the model's capacity to capture complex interaction semantics. These operations preserve node semantics while encouraging robustness to adversarial camouflage, enabling GNNs to uncover intricate anomalous cases. In the training stage, CRoC is further integrated with the contrastive learning paradigm. This allows GNNs to effectively harness unlabeled data during joint training, producing richer, more discriminative node embeddings. CRoC is evaluated on seven real-world GAD datasets with varying scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CRoC achieves up to 14% AUC improvement over baseline GNNs and outperforms state-of-the-art GAD methods under limited-label settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECAI 2025</p></details> |

While adhering to an assigned travel budget the algorithm seeks to maximize collected reward while incurring stochastic travel costs. In this context, the acceptable probability of exceeding the assigned budget is expressed as a chance constraint. Our MCTS solution is an online and anytime algorithm alternating planning and execution that determines the next vertex to visit by continuously monitoring the remaining travel budget. The novelty of our work is that the rollout phase in the MCTS framework is implemented using a message passing GNN, predicting both the utility and failure probability of each available action. This allows to enormously expedite the search process. Our experimental evaluation shows that with the proposed method and architecture we manage to efficiently solve complex problem instances while incurring in moderate losses in terms of collected reward. Moreover, we demonstrate how the approach is capable of generalizing beyond the characteristics of the training dataset.

Hypergraph neural networks, which rely on message-passing between nodes over hyperedges to learn latent representations, have emerged as the method of choice for predictive tasks in many of these domains. These approaches typically perform only a small number of message-passing rounds to learn the representations, which they then utilize for predictions. The small number of message-passing rounds comes at a cost, as the representations only capture local information and forego long-range high-order dependencies. However, as we demonstrate, blindly increasing the message-passing rounds to capture long-range dependency also degrades the performance of hyper-graph neural networks. Recent works have demonstrated that implicit graph neural networks capture long-range dependencies in standard graphs while maintaining performance. Despite their popularity, prior work has not studied long-range dependency issues on hypergraph neural networks. Here, we first demonstrate that existing hypergraph neural networks lose predictive power when aggregating more information to capture long-range dependency. We then propose Implicit Hypergraph Neural Network (IHNN), a novel framework that jointly learns fixed-point representations for both nodes and hyperedges in an end-to-end manner to alleviate this issue. Leveraging implicit differentiation, we introduce a tractable projected gradient descent approach to train the model efficiently. Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs for node classification demonstrate that IHNN outperforms the closest prior works in most settings, establishing a new state-of-the-art in hypergraph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICDM 2025</p></details> |

However, current reasoning models often lack explicit semantic hierarchies, user-domain knowledge alignment, and principled mechanisms to prune reasoning threads for effectiveness. These limitations result in lengthy generic output that does not guide users through goal-oriented reasoning steps. To address this, we propose a prototype-inspired, two-phases Reasoning-Threads-Evaluation (ReT-Eval) framework, drawing inspiration from human-like reasoning strategies that emphasize structured knowledge reuse. In the first phase, semantically relevant knowledge structures are extracted from a sparse domain knowledge graph using a graph neural network and enriched with intrinsic large language model knowledge to resolve knowledge discrepancies.

| **[Graph Neural Poisson Models for Supply Chain Relationship Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12044v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In supply chain networks, firms dynamically form or dissolve partnerships to adapt to market fluctuations, posing a challenge for predicting future supply relationships. We model the occurrence of supply edges (firm i to firm j) as a non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP), using historical event counts to estimate the Poisson intensity function up to time t. However, forecasting future intensities is hindered by the limitations of historical data alone. To overcome this, we propose a novel Graph Double Exponential Smoothing (GDES) model, which integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with a nonparametric double exponential smoothing approach to predict the probability of future supply edge formations.Recognizing the interdependent economic dynamics between upstream and downstream firms, we assume that the Poisson intensity functions of supply edges are correlated, aligning with the non-homogeneous nature of the process.Our model is interpretable, decomposing intensity increments into contributions from the current edge's historical data and influences from neighboring edges in the supply chain network. Evaluated on a large-scale supply chain dataset with 87,969 firms, our approach achieves an AUC of 93.84 % in dynamic link prediction, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing complex supply chain interactions for accurate forecasting.</p></details> | 17 pages, 2 figures |
| **[OneForecast: A Universal Framework for Global and Regional Weather Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00338v3)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate weather forecasts are important for disaster prevention, agricultural planning, etc. Traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods offer physically interpretable high-accuracy predictions but are computationally expensive and fail to fully leverage rapidly growing historical data. In recent years, deep learning models have made significant progress in weather forecasting, but challenges remain, such as balancing global and regional high-resolution forecasts, excessive smoothing in extreme event predictions, and insufficient dynamic system modeling. To address these issues, this paper proposes a global-regional nested weather forecasting framework (OneForecast) based on graph neural networks. By combining a dynamic system perspective with multi-grid theory, we construct a multi-scale graph structure and densify the target region to capture local high-frequency features. We introduce an adaptive messaging mechanism, using dynamic gating units to deeply integrate node and edge features for more accurate extreme event forecasting. For high-resolution regional forecasts, we propose a neural nested grid method to mitigate boundary information loss. Experimental results show that OneForecast performs excellently across global to regional scales and short-term to long-term forecasts, especially in extreme event predictions.

Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds promise for developing objective, scalable, and timely diagnostic tools. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art AI methods for depression detection and diagnosis, based on a systematic review of 55 key studies. We introduce a novel hierarchical taxonomy that structures the field by primary clinical task (diagnosis vs. prediction), data modality (text, speech, neuroimaging, multimodal), and computational model class (e.g., graph neural networks, large language models, hybrid approaches). Our in-depth analysis reveals three major trends: the predominance of graph neural networks for modeling brain connectivity, the rise of large language models for linguistic and conversational data, and an emerging focus on multimodal fusion, explainability, and algorithmic fairness. Alongside methodological insights, we provide an overview of prominent public datasets and standard evaluation metrics as a practical guide for researchers. By synthesizing current advances and highlighting open challenges, this survey offers a comprehensive roadmap for future innovation in computational psychiatry.</p></details> |  |
| **[STRIDE: Structure and Embedding Distillation with Attention for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15938v2)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have led to increased model sizes to enhance their capacity and accuracy. Such large models incur high memory usage, latency, and computational costs, thereby restricting their inference deployment. GNN compression techniques compress large GNNs into smaller ones with negligible accuracy loss. One of the most promising compression techniques is knowledge distillation (KD). However, most KD approaches for GNNs only consider the outputs of the last layers and do not consider the outputs of the intermediate layers of the GNNs. The intermediate layers may contain important inductive biases indicated by the graph structure and embeddings. Ignoring these layers may lead to a high accuracy drop, especially when the compression ratio is high. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel KD approach for GNN compression that we call Structure and Embedding Distillation with Attention (STRIDE). STRIDE utilizes attention to identify important intermediate teacher-student layer pairs and focuses on using those pairs to align graph structure and node embeddings. We evaluate STRIDE on several datasets, such as OGBN-Mag and OGBN-Arxiv, using different model architectures, including GCNIIs, RGCNs, and GraphSAGE. On average, STRIDE achieves a 2.13% increase in accuracy with a 32.3X compression ratio on OGBN-Mag, a large graph dataset, compared to state-of-the-art approaches. On smaller datasets (e.g., Pubmed), STRIDE achieves up to a 141X compression ratio with the same accuracy as state-of-the-art approaches. These results highlight the effectiveness of focusing on intermediate-layer knowledge to obtain compact, accurate, and practical GNN models.</p></details> |  |

Previous work applied GNNs to image-derived graph representations for various downstream tasks such as classification or anomaly detection. These transformations include segmenting images, extracting features from segments, mapping them to nodes, and connecting them. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has rigorously compared the effectiveness of the numerous potential image-to-graph transformation approaches for GNN-based graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD). In this study, we systematically evaluate the efficacy of multiple segmentation schemes, edge construction strategies, and node feature sets based on color, texture, and shape descriptors to produce suitable image-derived graph representations to perform graph-level anomaly detection. We conduct extensive experiments on dermoscopic images using state-of-the-art GLAD models, examining performance and efficiency in purely unsupervised, weakly supervised, and fully supervised regimes. Our findings reveal, for example, that color descriptors contribute the best standalone performance, while incorporating shape and texture features consistently enhances detection efficacy. In particular, our best unsupervised configuration using OCGTL achieves a competitive AUC-ROC score of up to 0.805 without relying on pretrained backbones like comparable image-based approaches. With the inclusion of sparse labels, the performance increases substantially to 0.872 and with full supervision to 0.914 AUC-ROC.</p></details> |  |

With upgrades scheduled for the detectors of colliding-beam experiments around the world, and specifically at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, more collisions and more complex interactions are expected. This directly implies an increase in data produced and consequently in the computational resources needed to process them. At CERN, the amount of data produced is gargantuan. This is why the data have to be heavily filtered and selected in real time before being permanently stored. This data can then be used to perform physics analyses, in order to expand our current understanding of the universe and improve the Standard Model of physics. This real-time filtering, known as triggering, involves complex processing happening often at frequencies as high as 40 MHz. This thesis contributes to understanding how machine learning models can be efficiently deployed in such environments, in order to maximize throughput and minimize energy consumption. Inevitably, modern hardware designed for such tasks and contemporary algorithms are needed in order to meet the challenges posed by the stringent, high-frequency data rates. In this work, I present our graph neural network-based pipeline, developed for charged particle track reconstruction at the LHCb experiment at CERN. The pipeline was implemented end-to-end inside LHCb's first-level trigger, entirely on GPUs. Its performance was compared against the classical tracking algorithms currently in production at LHCb. The pipeline was also accelerated on the FPGA architecture, and its performance in terms of power consumption and processing speed was compared against the GPU implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD t...</summary><p>PhD thesis, Chapters 8 and 9 include results from work performed in collaboration with Anthony Correia</p></details> |
| **[Towards Faithful Class-level Self-explainability in Graph Neural Networks by Subgraph Dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11513v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the interpretability of graph neural networks (GNNs) is crucial to ensure their safe and fair deployment. Recent work has introduced self-explainable GNNs that generate explanations as part of training, improving both faithfulness and efficiency. Some of these models, such as ProtGNN and PGIB, learn class-specific prototypes, offering a potential pathway toward class-level explanations. However, their evaluations focus solely on instance-level explanations, leaving open the question of whether these prototypes meaningfully generalize across instances of the same class. In this paper, we introduce GraphOracle, a novel self-explainable GNN framework designed to generate and evaluate class-level explanations for GNNs. Our model jointly learns a GNN classifier and a set of structured, sparse subgraphs that are discriminative for each class. We propose a novel integrated training that captures graph$\unicode{x2013}$subgraph$\unicode{x2013}$prediction dependencies efficiently and faithfully, validated through a masking-based evaluation strategy. This strategy enables us to retroactively assess whether prior methods like ProtGNN and PGIB deliver effective class-level explanations. Our results show that they do not. In contrast, GraphOracle achieves superior fidelity, explainability, and scalability across a range of graph classification tasks. We further demonstrate that GraphOracle avoids the computational bottlenecks of previous methods$\unicode{x2014}$like Monte Carlo Tree Search$\unicode{x2014}$by using entropy-regularized subgraph selection and lightweight random walk extraction, enabling faster and more scalable training. These findings position GraphOracle as a practical and principled solution for faithful class-level self-explainability in GNNs.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Discovering Invariant Neighborhood Patterns for Heterophilic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10572v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the problem of distribution shifts on non-homophilous graphs Mosting existing graph neural network methods rely on the homophilous assumption that nodes from the same class are more likely to be linked. However, such assumptions of homophily do not always hold in real-world graphs, which leads to more complex distribution shifts unaccounted for in previous methods. The distribution shifts of neighborhood patterns are much more diverse on non-homophilous graphs. We propose a novel Invariant Neighborhood Pattern Learning (INPL) to alleviate the distribution shifts problem on non-homophilous graphs. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive Neighborhood Propagation (ANP) module to capture the adaptive neighborhood information, which could alleviate the neighborhood pattern distribution shifts problem on non-homophilous graphs. We propose Invariant Non-Homophilous Graph Learning (INHGL) module to constrain the ANP and learn invariant graph representation on non-homophilous graphs. Extensive experimental results on real-world non-homophilous graphs show that INPL could achieve state-of-the-art performance for learning on large non-homophilous graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Sensory Cognitive Computing for Learning Population-level Brain Connectivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11436v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generation of connectional brain templates (CBTs) has recently garnered significant attention for its potential to identify unique connectivity patterns shared across individuals. However, existing methods for CBT learning such as conventional machine learning and graph neural networks (GNNs) are hindered by several limitations. These include: (i) poor interpretability due to their black-box nature, (ii) high computational cost, and (iii) an exclusive focus on structure and topology, overlooking the cognitive capacity of the generated CBT. To address these challenges, we introduce mCOCO (multi-sensory COgnitive COmputing), a novel framework that leverages Reservoir Computing (RC) to learn population-level functional CBT from BOLD (Blood-Oxygen-level-Dependent) signals. RC's dynamic system properties allow for tracking state changes over time, enhancing interpretability and enabling the modeling of brain-like dynamics, as demonstrated in prior literature. By integrating multi-sensory inputs (e.g., text, audio, and visual data), mCOCO captures not only structure and topology but also how brain regions process information and adapt to cognitive tasks such as sensory processing, all in a computationally efficient manner. Our mCOCO framework consists of two phases: (1) mapping BOLD signals into the reservoir to derive individual functional connectomes, which are then aggregated into a group-level CBT - an approach, to the best of our knowledge, not previously explored in functional connectivity studies - and (2) incorporating multi-sensory inputs through a cognitive reservoir, endowing the CBT with cognitive traits. Extensive evaluations show that our mCOCO-based template significantly outperforms GNN-based CBT in terms of centeredness, discriminativeness, topological soundness, and multi-sensory memory retention.

| **[Non-Dissipative Graph Propagation for Non-Local Community Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14097v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Community detection in graphs aims to cluster nodes into meaningful groups, a task particularly challenging in heterophilic graphs, where nodes sharing similarities and membership to the same community are typically distantly connected. This is particularly evident when this task is tackled by graph neural networks, since they rely on an inherently local message passing scheme to learn the node representations that serve to cluster nodes into communities. In this work, we argue that the ability to propagate long-range information during message passing is key to effectively perform community detection in heterophilic graphs. To this end, we introduce the Unsupervised Antisymmetric Graph Neural Network (uAGNN), a novel unsupervised community detection approach leveraging non-dissipative dynamical systems to ensure stability and to propagate long-range information effectively. By employing antisymmetric weight matrices, uAGNN captures both local and global graph structures, overcoming the limitations posed by heterophilic scenarios. Extensive experiments across ten datasets demonstrate uAGNN's superior performance in high and medium heterophilic settings, where traditional methods fail to exploit long-range dependencies. These results highlight uAGNN's potential as a powerful tool for unsupervised community detection in diverse graph environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

However, many real-world systems, such as social or biological networks, exhibit complex interactions that are more naturally represented by higher-order topological domains. The emerging field of Geometric and Topological Deep Learning addresses this challenge by introducing methods that utilize and benefit from higher-order structures. Central to TDL is the concept of lifting, which transforms data representations from basic graph forms to more expressive topologies before the application of GNN models for learning. In this work, we propose a structural lifting strategy using Forman-Ricci curvature, which defines an edge-based network characteristic based on Riemannian geometry. Curvature reveals local and global properties of a graph, such as a network's backbones, i.e. coarse, structure-preserving graph geometries that form connections between major communities - most suitably represented as hyperedges to model information flows between clusters across large distances in the network. To this end, our approach provides a remedy to the problem of information distortion in message passing across long distances and graph bottlenecks - a phenomenon known in graph learning as over-squashing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Diffusion via Generalized Opinion Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11249v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a growing interest in developing diffusion-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), building on the connections between message passing mechanisms in GNNs and physical diffusion processes. However, existing methods suffer from three critical limitations: (1) they rely on homogeneous diffusion with static dynamics, limiting adaptability to diverse graph structures; (2) their depth is constrained by computational overhead and diminishing interpretability; and (3) theoretical understanding of their convergence behavior remains limited. To address these challenges, we propose GODNF, a Generalized Opinion Dynamics Neural Framework, which unifies multiple opinion dynamics models into a principled, trainable diffusion mechanism. Our framework captures heterogeneous diffusion patterns and temporal dynamics via node-specific behavior modeling and dynamic neighborhood influence, while ensuring efficient and interpretable message propagation even at deep layers. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating GODNF's ability to model diverse convergence configurations. Extensive empirical evaluations of node classification and influence estimation tasks confirm GODNF's superiority over state-of-the-art GNNs.</p></details> |  |

Traditional site planning often relies on experiential judgment and single-source data, limiting systematic quantification of multifunctional layouts. We propose a Site Planning Layout Indicator (SPLI) system, a data-driven framework integrating empirical knowledge with heterogeneous multi-source data to produce structured urban spatial information. The SPLI supports multimodal spatial data systems for analytics, inference, and retrieval by combining OpenStreetMap (OSM), Points of Interest (POI), building morphology, land use, and satellite imagery. It extends conventional metrics through five dimensions: (1) Hierarchical Building Function Classification, refining empirical systems into clear hierarchies; (2) Spatial Organization, quantifying seven layout patterns (e.g., symmetrical, concentric, axial-oriented); (3) Functional Diversity, transforming qualitative assessments into measurable indicators using Functional Ratio (FR) and Simpson Index (SI); (4) Accessibility to Essential Services, integrating facility distribution and transport networks for comprehensive accessibility metrics; and (5) Land Use Intensity, using Floor Area Ratio (FAR) and Building Coverage Ratio (BCR) to assess utilization efficiency. Data gaps are addressed through deep learning, including Relational Graph Neural Networks (RGNN) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Experiments show the SPLI improves functional classification accuracy and provides a standardized basis for automated, data-driven urban spatial analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 32 figures, submitted to Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science</p></details> |

In order to obtain an accurate, robust yet lightweight human pose estimator, one feasible way is to transfer pose knowledge from a powerful teacher model to a less-parameterized student model by knowledge distillation. However, the traditional knowledge distillation framework does not fully explore the contextual information among human joints. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine two-stage knowledge distillation framework for human pose estimation. In the first-stage distillation, we introduce the human joints structure loss to mine the structural information among human joints so as to transfer high-level semantic knowledge from the teacher model to the student model. In the second-stage distillation, we utilize an Image-Guided Progressive Graph Convolutional Network (IGP-GCN) to refine the initial human pose obtained from the first-stage distillation and supervise the training of the IGP-GCN in the progressive way by the final output pose of teacher model. The extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset: COCO keypoint and CrowdPose datasets, show that our proposed method performs favorably against lots of the existing state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods, especially for the more complex CrowdPose dataset, the performance improvement of our model is more significant.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable Attention-Guided Stacked Graph Neural Networks for Malware Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09801v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Malware detection in modern computing environments demands models that are not only accurate but also interpretable and robust to evasive techniques. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in this domain by modeling rich structural dependencies in graph-based program representations such as control flow graphs (CFGs). However, single-model approaches may suffer from limited generalization and lack interpretability, especially in high-stakes security applications. In this paper, we propose a novel stacking ensemble framework for graph-based malware detection and explanation. Our method dynamically extracts CFGs from portable executable (PE) files and encodes their basic blocks through a two-step embedding strategy. A set of diverse GNN base learners, each with a distinct message-passing mechanism, is used to capture complementary behavioral features. Their prediction outputs are aggregated by a meta-learner implemented as an attention-based multilayer perceptron, which both classifies malware instances and quantifies the contribution of each base model. To enhance explainability, we introduce an ensemble-aware post-hoc explanation technique that leverages edge-level importance scores generated by a GNN explainer and fuses them using the learned attention weights. This produces interpretable, model-agnostic explanations aligned with the final ensemble decision. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework improves classification performance while providing insightful interpretations of malware behavior.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid development of graph neural networks (GNNs), GAD methods have achieved significant performance improvements. However, fairness considerations in GAD remain largely underexplored. Indeed, GNN-based GAD models can inherit and amplify biases present in training data, potentially leading to unfair outcomes. While existing efforts have focused on developing fair GNNs, most approaches target node classification tasks, where models often rely on simple layer architectures rather than autoencoder-based structures, which are the most widely used architecturs for anomaly detection. To address fairness in autoencoder-based GAD models, we propose \textbf{D}is\textbf{E}ntangled \textbf{C}ounterfactual \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{F}air (DECAF)-GAD, a framework that alleviates bias while preserving GAD performance. Specifically, we introduce a structural causal model (SCM) to disentangle sensitive attributes from learned representations. Based on this causal framework, we formulate a specialized autoencoder architecture along with a fairness-guided loss function. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that DECAF-GAD not only achieves competitive anomaly detection performance but also significantly enhances fairness metrics compared to baseline GAD methods.

To address the lack of explainability of GNNs on KGs, recent works extract Datalog rules from GNNs with provable correspondence guarantees. The extracted rules can be used to explain the GNN's predictions; furthermore, they can help characterise the expressive power of various GNN models. However, these works address only a form of link prediction based on a restricted, low-expressivity graph encoding/decoding method. In this paper, we consider a more general and popular approach for link prediction where a scoring function is used to decode the GNN output into fact predictions. We show how GNNs and scoring functions can be adapted to be monotonic, use the monotonicity to extract sound rules for explaining predictions, and leverage existing results about the kind of rules that scoring functions can capture. We also define procedures for obtaining equivalent Datalog programs for certain classes of monotonic GNNs with scoring functions. Our experiments show that, on link prediction benchmarks, monotonic GNNs and scoring functions perform well in practice and yield many sound rules.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version (with appendices) of paper accepted to KR 2025 (22nd International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning)</p></details> |

We then test two selected variants on twelve benchmark datasets that span a range of different domains.

Within this context, we introduce CL's effective model capacity (CLEMC) that characterizes the dynamic behavior of the stability-plasticity balance point. We develop a difference equation to model the evolution of the interplay between the NN, task data, and optimization procedure. We then leverage CLEMC to demonstrate that the effective capacity-and, by extension, the stability-plasticity balance point is inherently non-stationary. We show that regardless of the NN architecture or optimization method, a NN's ability to represent new tasks diminishes when incoming task distributions differ from previous ones. We conduct extensive experiments to support our theoretical findings, spanning a range of architectures-from small feedforward network and convolutional networks to medium-sized graph neural networks and transformer-based large language models with millions of parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[GNN-based Unified Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10583v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models often struggle to maintain generalizability in medical imaging, particularly under domain-fracture scenarios where distribution shifts arise from varying imaging techniques, acquisition protocols, patient populations, demographics, and equipment. In practice, each hospital may need to train distinct models - differing in learning task, width, and depth - to match local data. For example, one hospital may use Euclidean architectures such as MLPs and CNNs for tabular or grid-like image data, while another may require non-Euclidean architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for irregular data like brain connectomes. How to train such heterogeneous models coherently across datasets, while enhancing each model's generalizability, remains an open problem. We propose unified learning, a new paradigm that encodes each model into a graph representation, enabling unification in a shared graph learning space. A GNN then guides optimization of these unified models. By decoupling parameters of individual models and controlling them through a unified GNN (uGNN), our method supports parameter sharing and knowledge transfer across varying architectures (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) and distributions, improving generalizability. Evaluations on MorphoMNIST and two MedMNIST benchmarks - PneumoniaMNIST and BreastMNIST - show that unified learning boosts performance when models are trained on unique distributions and tested on mixed ones, demonstrating strong robustness to unseen data with large distribution shifts.

| **[DiRW: Path-Aware Digraph Learning for Heterophily](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10320v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, graph neural network (GNN) has emerged as a powerful representation learning tool for graph-structured data. However, most approaches are tailored for undirected graphs, neglecting the abundant information in the edges of directed graphs (digraphs). In fact, digraphs are widely applied in the real world and confirmed to address heterophily challenges. Despite recent advancements, existing spatial- and spectral-based DiGNNs have limitations due to their complex learning mechanisms and reliance on high-quality topology, resulting in low efficiency and unstable performance. To address these issues, we propose Directed Random Walk (DiRW), a plug-and-play strategy for most spatial-based DiGNNs and also an innovative model which offers a new digraph learning paradigm. Specifically, it utilizes a direction-aware path sampler optimized from the perspectives of walk probability, length, and number in a weight-free manner by considering node profiles and topologies. Building upon this, DiRW incorporates a node-wise learnable path aggregator for generalized node representations. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets demonstrate that DiRW: (1) enhances most spatial-based methods as a plug-and-play strategy; (2) achieves SOTA performance as a new digraph learning paradigm.

| **[GraphFedMIG: Tackling Class Imbalance in Federated Graph Learning via Mutual Information-Guided Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10471v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train powerful graph neural networks without sharing their private, decentralized graph data. Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is critically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data distributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A particularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the global model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying rare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a minority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information, hindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this challenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the problem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a hierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local generator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide tailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a dedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual information-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators. By calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism corrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of mutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value, minority-class features. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed GraphFedMIG compared with other baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, their decision-making remains largely opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes clinical applications where interpretability is essential. Existing explainability techniques for GNNs are typically post-hoc and global, offering limited insight into individual node decisions or local reasoning. We introduce X-Node, a self-explaining GNN framework in which each node generates its own explanation as part of the prediction process. For every node, we construct a structured context vector encoding interpretable cues such as degree, centrality, clustering, feature saliency, and label agreement within its local topology. A lightweight Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation vector, which serves three purposes: (1) reconstructing the node's latent embedding via a decoder to enforce faithfulness, (2) generating a natural language explanation using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Grok or Gemini), and (3) guiding the GNN itself via a "text-injection" mechanism that feeds explanations back into the message-passing pipeline. We evaluate X-Node on two graph datasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrating it with GCN, GAT, and GIN backbones. Our results show that X-Node maintains competitive classification accuracy while producing faithful, per-node explanations. Repository: https://github.com/basiralab/X-Node.</p></details> |  |
| **[Influence Maximization in Multi-layer Social Networks Based on Differentiated Graph Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10289v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying influential nodes is crucial in social network analysis. Existing methods often neglect local opinion leader tendencies, resulting in overlapping influence ranges for seed nodes. Furthermore, approaches based on vanilla graph neural networks (GNNs) struggle to effectively aggregate influence characteristics during message passing, particularly with varying influence intensities. Current techniques also fail to adequately address the multi-layer nature of social networks and node heterogeneity. To address these issues, this paper proposes Inf-MDE, a novel multi-layer influence maximization method leveraging differentiated graph embedding. Inf-MDE models social relationships using a multi-layer network structure. The model extracts a self-influence propagation subgraph to eliminate the representation bias between node embeddings and propagation dynamics. Additionally, Inf-MDE incorporates an adaptive local influence aggregation mechanism within its GNN design. This mechanism dynamically adjusts influence feature aggregation during message passing based on local context and influence intensity, enabling it to effectively capture both inter-layer propagation heterogeneity and intra-layer diffusion dynamics. Extensive experiments across four distinct multi-layer social network datasets demonstrate that Inf-MDE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

These limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction performance and lightweight deployment.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a graph neural network-based OIQA framework that explicitly models structural relationships between viewports to enhance perception of spatial distortion non-uniformity. Our approach employs Fibonacci sphere sampling to generate viewports with well-structured topology, representing each as a graph node. Multi-stage feature extraction networks then derive high-dimensional node representation. To holistically capture spatial dependencies, we integrate a Graph Attention Network (GAT) modeling fine-grained local distortion variations among adjacent viewports, and a graph transformer capturing long-range quality interactions across distant regions. Extensive experiments on two large-scale OIQA databases with complex spatial distortions demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, confirming its effectiveness and strong generalization capability.</p></details> |  |

Many existing solutions rely on computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

Their expressive power is intimately related to logics that are invariant under graded bisimilarity. Current proposals for recurrent GNNs either assume that the graph size is given to the model, or suffer from a lack of termination guarantees. In this paper, we propose a halting mechanism for recurrent GNNs. We prove that our halting model can express all node classifiers definable in graded modal mu-calculus, even for the standard GNN variant that is oblivious to the graph size. To prove our main result, we develop a new approximate semantics for graded mu-calculus, which we believe to be of independent interest. We leverage this new semantics into a new model-checking algorithm, called the counting algorithm, which is oblivious to the graph size. In a final step we show that the counting algorithm can be implemented on a halting recurrent GNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended technical report of paper accepted for publication at KR 2025</p></details> |

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are well suited to capture structural dependencies in process data, existing GNN-based PBPM models remain underdeveloped. Most rely either on short prefix subgraphs or global architectures that overlook temporal relevance and transition semantics. We propose a unified, interpretable GNN framework that advances the state of the art along three key axes. First, we compare prefix-based Graph Convolutional Networks(GCNs) and full trace Graph Attention Networks(GATs) to quantify the performance gap between localized and global modeling. Second, we introduce a novel time decay attention mechanism that constructs dynamic, prediction-centered windows, emphasizing temporally relevant history and suppressing noise. Third, we embed transition type semantics into edge features to enable fine grained reasoning over structurally ambiguous traces. Our architecture includes multilevel interpretability modules, offering diverse visualizations of attention behavior. Evaluated on five benchmarks, the proposed models achieve competitive Top-k accuracy and DL scores without per-dataset tuning. By addressing architectural, temporal, and semantic gaps, this work presents a robust, generalizable, and explainable solution for next event prediction in PBPM.</p></details> | 32 pages |
| **[Graph Neural Network and Transformer Integration for Unsupervised System Anomaly Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09401v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study proposes an unsupervised anomaly detection method for distributed backend service systems, addressing practical challenges such as complex structural dependencies, diverse behavioral evolution, and the absence of labeled data. The method constructs a dynamic graph based on service invocation relationships and applies graph convolution to extract high-order structural representations from multi-hop topologies. A Transformer is used to model the temporal behavior of each node, capturing long-term dependencies and local fluctuations. During the feature fusion stage, a learnable joint embedding mechanism integrates structural and behavioral representations into a unified anomaly vector. A nonlinear mapping is then applied to compute anomaly scores, enabling an end-to-end detection process without supervision. Experiments on real-world cloud monitoring data include sensitivity analyses across different graph depths, sequence lengths, and data perturbations. Results show that the proposed method outperforms existing models on several key metrics, demonstrating stronger expressiveness and stability in capturing anomaly propagation paths and modeling dynamic behavior sequences, with high potential for practical deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exact Verification of Graph Neural Networks with Incremental Constraint Solving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09320v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes applications, such as fraud detection or healthcare, but are susceptible to adversarial attacks. A number of techniques have been proposed to provide adversarial robustness guarantees, but support for commonly used aggregation functions in message-passing GNNs is still lacking. In this paper, we develop an exact (sound and complete) verification method for GNNs to compute guarantees against attribute and structural perturbations that involve edge addition or deletion, subject to budget constraints. Focusing on node classification tasks, our method employs constraint solving with bound tightening, and iteratively solves a sequence of relaxed constraint satisfaction problems while relying on incremental solving capabilities of solvers to improve efficiency. We implement GNNev, a versatile solver for message-passing neural networks, which supports three aggregation functions, sum, max and mean, with the latter two considered here for the first time. Extensive experimental evaluation of GNNev on two standard benchmarks (Cora and CiteSeer) and two real-world fraud datasets (Amazon and Yelp) demonstrates its usability and effectiveness, as well as superior performance compared to existing {exact verification} tools on sum-aggregated node classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Over-Squashing in GNNs and Causal Inference of Rewiring Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09265v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance across wide-range of domains such as recommender systems, material design, and drug repurposing. Yet message-passing GNNs suffer from over-squashing -- exponential compression of long-range information from distant nodes -- which limits expressivity. Rewiring techniques can ease this bottleneck; but their practical impacts are unclear due to the lack of a direct empirical over-squashing metric. We propose a rigorous, topology-focused method for assessing over-squashing between node pairs using the decay rate of their mutual sensitivity. We then extend these pairwise assessments to four graph-level statistics (prevalence, intensity, variability, extremity). Coupling these metrics with a within-graph causal design, we quantify how rewiring strategies affect over-squashing on diverse graph- and node-classification benchmarks. Our extensive empirical analyses show that most graph classification datasets suffer from over-squashing (but to various extents), and rewiring effectively mitigates it -- though the degree of mitigation, and its translation into performance gains, varies by dataset and method. We also found that over-squashing is less notable in node classification datasets, where rewiring often increases over-squashing, and performance variations are uncorrelated with over-squashing changes. These findings suggest that rewiring is most beneficial when over-squashing is both substantial and corrected with restraint -- while overly aggressive rewiring, or rewiring applied to minimally over-squashed graphs, is unlikely to help and may even harm performance. Our plug-and-play diagnostic tool lets practitioners decide -- before any training -- whether rewiring is likely to pay off.</p></details> | 14 pages, 2 figures |

The state-of-the-art for predicting missing links in the hard case of a network without node attributes uses model stacking or neural network techniques. It remains unknown which approach is best, and whether or how the best choice of algorithm depends on the input network's characteristics. We answer these questions systematically using a large, structurally diverse benchmark of 550 real-world networks under two standard accuracy measures (AUC and Top-k), comparing four stacking algorithms with 42 topological link predictors, two of which we introduce here, and two graph neural network algorithms. We show that no algorithm is best across all input networks, all algorithms perform well on most social networks, and few perform well on economic and biological networks. Overall, model stacking with a random forest is both highly scalable and surpasses on AUC or is competitive with graph neural networks on Top-k accuracy. But, algorithm performance depends strongly on network characteristics like the degree distribution, triangle density, and degree assortativity. We introduce a meta-learning algorithm that exploits this variability to optimize link predictions for individual networks by selecting the best algorithm to apply, which we show outperforms all state-of-the-art algorithms and scales to large networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables, 7 appendices</p></details> |

This work proposes a novel approach by combining Quantum Inspired Graph Neural Networks (QI-GNN) with flexibility of choice of an Ensemble Model using QBoost or a classic model such as Random Forrest Classifier. This system is tailored specifically for blockchain network analysis in anti-money laundering (AML) efforts. Our methodology to design this system incorporates a novel component, a Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition layer within the graph neural network framework, enhancing its capability to process and analyze complex data structures efficiently. Our technical approach has undergone rigorous evaluation against classical machine learning implementations, achieving an F2 score of 74.8% in detecting fraudulent transactions. These results highlight the potential of quantum-inspired techniques, supplemented by the structural advancements of the CP layer, to not only match but potentially exceed traditional methods in complex network analysis for financial security. The findings advocate for a broader adoption and further exploration of quantum-inspired algorithms within the financial sector to effectively combat fraud.</p></details> |  |

However, their widespread adoption and growing financial significance have attracted persistent and sophisticated threats, such as phishing campaigns and contract-level exploits. Traditional transaction-based threat detection methods often expose sensitive user data and interactions, raising privacy and security concerns. In response, static bytecode analysis has emerged as a proactive mitigation strategy, identifying malicious contracts before they execute harmful actions. Building on this approach, we introduced PhishingHook, the first machine-learning-based framework for detecting phishing activities in smart contracts via static bytecode and opcode analysis, achieving approximately 90% detection accuracy. Nevertheless, two pressing challenges remain: (1) the increasing use of sophisticated bytecode obfuscation techniques designed to evade static analysis, and (2) the heterogeneity of blockchain environments requiring platform-agnostic solutions. This paper presents a vision for ScamDetect (Smart Contract Agnostic Malware Detector), a robust, modular, and platform-agnostic framework for smart contract malware detection. Over the next 2.5 years, ScamDetect will evolve in two stages: first, by tackling obfuscated Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode through graph neural network (GNN) analysis of control flow graphs (CFGs), leveraging GNNs' ability to capture complex structural patterns beyond opcode sequences; and second, by generalizing detection capabilities to emerging runtimes such as WASM. ScamDetect aims to enable proactive, scalable security for the future of decentralized ecosystems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiated Information Mining: A Semi-supervised Learning Framework for GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08769v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In semi-supervised learning (SSL) for enhancing the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) with unlabeled data, introducing mutually independent decision factors for cross-validation is regarded as an effective strategy to alleviate pseudo-label confirmation bias and training collapse. However, obtaining such factors is challenging in practice: additional and valid information sources are inherently scarce, and even when such sources are available, their independence from the original source cannot be guaranteed. To address this challenge, In this paper we propose a Differentiated Factor Consistency Semi-supervised Framework (DiFac), which derives differentiated factors from a single information source and enforces their consistency. During pre-training, the model learns to extract these factors; in training, it iteratively removes samples with conflicting factors and ranks pseudo-labels based on the shortest stave principle, selecting the top candidate samples to reduce overconfidence commonly observed in confidence-based or ensemble-based methods. Our framework can also incorporate additional information sources. In this work, we leverage the large multimodal language model to introduce latent textual knowledge as auxiliary decision factors, and we design a accountability scoring mechanism to mitigate additional erroneous judgments introduced by these auxiliary factors. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that DiFac consistently improves robustness and generalization in low-label regimes, outperforming other baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

The iterative hybrid mechanism integrates the proposed Node-Destroyer Model, a machine learning hybrid model that utilized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) such identifies and selects customer nodes to guide the Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) operator within the metaheuristic optimization frameworks. This model leverages the structural properties of the problem and solution that can be represented as a graph, to guide strategic selections concerning node removal. The proposed approach reduces operational complexity and scales down the search space involved in the optimization process. The hybrid approach is applied specifically to the CVRP and does not require retraining across problem instances of different sizes. The proposed hybrid mechanism is able to improve the performance of baseline metaheuristic algorithms. Our approach not only enhances the solution quality for standard CVRP benchmarks but also proves scalability on very large-scale instances with up to 30,000 customer nodes. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets show that the proposed hybrid mechanism is capable of improving different baseline algorithms, achieving better quality of solutions under similar settings.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |

Molecular representation methods, including fingerprints and graph neural networks (GNNs), achieve state-of-the-art results by effectively deriving features from molecular structures. However, these methods often overlook decades of accumulated semantic and contextual knowledge. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning abilities and prior knowledge across scientific domains, leading us to hypothesize that LLMs can generate rich molecular representations when guided to reason in multiple perspectives. To address these gaps, we propose $\text{M}^{2}$LLM, a multi-view framework that integrates three perspectives: the molecular structure view, the molecular task view, and the molecular rules view. These views are fused dynamically to adapt to task requirements, and experiments demonstrate that $\text{M}^{2}$LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks across classification and regression tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that representation derived from LLM achieves exceptional performance by leveraging two core functionalities: the generation of molecular embeddings through their encoding capabilities and the curation of molecular features through advanced reasoning processes.</p></details> | IJCAI 2025 |

The main of our method is an edge solution selector model, which classifies solution edges to identify prohibited moves during the local search, hence guiding the search process within metaheuristic baselines. Two learning-based mechanisms are used to develop the edge selector: a simple tabular binary classifier and a Graph Neural Network (GNN). The tabular classifier employs Gradient Boosting Trees and Feedforward Neural Network as the baseline algorithms. Adjustments to the decision threshold are also applied to handle the class imbalance in the problem instance. An alternative mechanism employs the GNN to utilize graph structure for direct solution edge prediction, with the objective of guiding local search by predicting prohibited moves. These hybrid mechanisms are then applied in state-fo-the-art metaheuristic baselines. Our method demonstrates both scalability and generalizability, achieving performance improvements across different baseline metaheuristics, various problem sizes and variants, including the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and CVRP with Time Windows (CVRPTW). Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets up to 30,000 customer nodes, supported by pair-wise statistical analysis, verify the observed improvements.</p></details> | 29 pages, 12 figures |

However, jointly controlling both in real-time to alleviate traffic congestion presents new challenges, such as the inherent physical and behavioral heterogeneity between signal control and platooning, as well as coordination between them. This paper proposes an innovative solution to tackle these challenges based on heterogeneous graph multi-agent reinforcement learning and traffic theories. Our approach involves: 1) designing platoon and signal control as distinct reinforcement learning agents with their own set of observations, actions, and reward functions to optimize traffic flow; 2) designing coordination by incorporating graph neural networks within multi-agent reinforcement learning to facilitate seamless information exchange among agents on a regional scale; 3) applying alternating optimization for training, allowing agents to update their own policies and adapt to other agents' policies. We evaluate our approach through SUMO simulations, which show convergent results in terms of both travel time and fuel consumption, and superior performance compared to other adaptive signal control methods.</p></details> |  |

These models are trained on fleet movement data, including robot positions, goals, and interactions, from hundreds of thousands of robots in Amazon warehouses worldwide. DeepFleet consists of four architectures that each embody a distinct inductive bias and collectively explore key points in the design space for multi-agent foundation models: the robot-centric (RC) model is an autoregressive decision transformer operating on neighborhoods of individual robots; the robot-floor (RF) model uses a transformer with cross-attention between robots and the warehouse floor; the image-floor (IF) model applies convolutional encoding to a multi-channel image representation of the full fleet; and the graph-floor (GF) model combines temporal attention with graph neural networks for spatial relationships. In this paper, we describe these models and present our evaluation of the impact of these design choices on prediction task performance. We find that the robot-centric and graph-floor models, which both use asynchronous robot state updates and incorporate the localized structure of robot interactions, show the most promise. We also present experiments that show that these two models can make effective use of larger warehouses operation datasets as the models are scaled up.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

In recent years, researchers have made significant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for spatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic, i.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty, leading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies have introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically focus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes), thereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban phenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network with Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal prediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware Spatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph convolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network to effectively capture complex spatial and temporal interaction patterns, and (ii) a multivariate probabilistic prediction module designed to estimate both expected mean values and associated uncertainties. Extensive experiments on four real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets from Shenzhen, New York City, and Chicago demonstrate that UQGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification. For example, on the Shenzhen dataset, UQGNN achieves a 5% improvement in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, SIGSPATIAL 2025</p></details> |

We introduce the Intersecting Block Graph (IBG), a low-rank factorization of large directed graphs based on combinations of intersecting bipartite components, each consisting of a pair of communities, for source and target nodes. By giving less weight to non-edges, we show how to efficiently approximate any graph, sparse or dense, by a dense IBG. Specifically, we prove a constructive version of the weak regularity lemma, showing that for any chosen accuracy, every graph, regardless of its size or sparsity, can be approximated by a dense IBG whose rank depends only on the accuracy. This dependence of the rank solely on the accuracy, and not on the sparsity level, is in contrast to previous forms of the weak regularity lemma. We present a graph neural network architecture operating on the IBG representation of the graph and demonstrating competitive performance on node classification, spatio-temporal graph analysis, and knowledge graph completion, while having memory and computational complexity linear in the number of nodes rather than edges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Diffusion-Based Model-Level Explanation of Heterogeneous GNNs with Node Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08458v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world datasets, such as citation networks, social networks, and molecular structures, are naturally represented as heterogeneous graphs, where nodes belong to different types and have additional features. For example, in a citation network, nodes representing "Paper" or "Author" may include attributes like keywords or affiliations. A critical machine learning task on these graphs is node classification, which is useful for applications such as fake news detection, corporate risk assessment, and molecular property prediction. Although Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) perform well in these contexts, their predictions remain opaque. Existing post-hoc explanation methods lack support for actual node features beyond one-hot encoding of node type and often fail to generate realistic, faithful explanations. To address these gaps, we propose DiGNNExplainer, a model-level explanation approach that synthesizes heterogeneous graphs with realistic node features via discrete denoising diffusion. In particular, we generate realistic discrete features (e.g., bag-of-words features) using diffusion models within a discrete space, whereas previous approaches are limited to continuous spaces. We evaluate our approach on multiple datasets and show that DiGNNExplainer produces explanations that are realistic and faithful to the model's decision-making, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Through an extensive analysis of relevant studies, it is found that there is a lack of research work concerning algorithm selection oriented toward the Maximum Clique Problem (MCP). In this work, we propose a learning-based framework that integrates both traditional machine learning and graph neural networks to address this gap. We construct a labeled dataset by running four exact MCP algorithms on a diverse collection of graph instances, accompanied by structural and global statistical features extracted from each graph. We first evaluate four conventional classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), across multiple dataset variants. Experimental results show that RF consistently shows strong performance across metrics and dataset variants, making it a reliable baseline. In addition, feature importance analysis indicates that connectivity and topological structure are strong predictors of algorithm performance. Building on these findings, we develop a dual-channel model named GAT-MLP, which combines a Graph Attention Network (GAT) for local structural encoding with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for global feature modeling. The GAT-MLP model shows strong and consistent performance across all metrics. Our results highlight the effectiveness of dual-channel architectures and the promise of graph neural networks in combinatorial algorithm selection.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

| **[TLV-HGNN: Thinking Like a Vertex for Memory-efficient HGNN Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07796v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) excel at processing heterogeneous graph data and are widely applied in critical domains. In HGNN inference, the neighbor aggregation stage is the primary performance determinant, yet it suffers from two major sources of memory inefficiency. First, the commonly adopted per-semantic execution paradigm stores intermediate aggregation results for each semantic prior to semantic fusion, causing substantial memory expansion. Second, the aggregation process incurs extensive redundant memory accesses, including repeated loading of target vertex features across semantics and repeated accesses to shared neighbors due to cross-semantic neighborhood overlap. These inefficiencies severely limit scalability and reduce HGNN inference performance. In this work, we first propose a semantics-complete execution paradigm from a vertex perspective that eliminates per-semantic intermediate storage and redundant target vertex accesses. Building on this paradigm, we design TVL-HGNN, a reconfigurable hardware accelerator optimized for efficient aggregation. In addition, we introduce a vertex grouping technique based on cross-semantic neighborhood overlap, with hardware implementation, to reduce redundant accesses to shared neighbors. Experimental results demonstrate that TVL-HGNN achieves average speedups of 7.85x and 1.41x over the NVIDIA A100 GPU and the state-of-the-art HGNN accelerator HiHGNN, respectively, while reducing energy consumption by 98.79% and 32.61%.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, accepted by ICCD 2025</p></details> |
| **[ReaGAN: Node-as-Agent-Reasoning Graph Agentic Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00429v3)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in graph-based learning by propagating information among neighbor nodes via predefined aggregation mechanisms. However, such fixed schemes often suffer from two key limitations. First, they cannot handle the imbalance in node informativeness -- some nodes are rich in information, while others remain sparse. Second, predefined message passing primarily leverages local structural similarity while ignoring global semantic relationships across the graph, limiting the model's ability to capture distant but relevant information. We propose Retrieval-augmented Graph Agentic Network (ReaGAN), an agent-based framework that empowers each node with autonomous, node-level decision-making. Each node acts as an agent that independently plans its next action based on its internal memory, enabling node-level planning and adaptive message propagation. Additionally, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows nodes to access semantically relevant content and build global relationships in the graph. ReaGAN achieves competitive performance under few-shot in-context settings using a frozen LLM backbone without fine-tuning, showcasing the potential of agentic planning and local-global retrieval in graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, work in progress</p></details> |
| **[Discovering Spatial Correlations between Earth Observations in Global Atmospheric State Estimation by using Adaptive Graph Structure Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07659v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study aims to discover spatial correlations between Earth observations and atmospheric states to improve the forecasting accuracy of global atmospheric state estimation, which are usually conducted using conventional numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems and is the beginning of weather forecasting. NWP systems predict future atmospheric states at fixed locations, which are called NWP grid points, by analyzing previous atmospheric states and newly acquired Earth observations without fixed locations. Thus, surrounding meteorological context and the changing locations of the observations make spatial correlations between atmospheric states and observations over time. To handle complicated spatial correlations, which change dynamically, we employ spatiotemporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) with structure learning. However, structure learning has an inherent limitation that this can cause structural information loss and over-smoothing problem by generating excessive edges. To solve this problem, we regulate edge sampling by adaptively determining node degrees and considering the spatial distances between NWP grid points and observations. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method by using real-world atmospheric state and observation data from East Asia. Even in areas with high atmospheric variability, the proposed method outperformed existing STGNN models with and without structure learning.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Enhancing Egocentric Object Detection in Static Environments using Graph-based Spatial Anomaly Detection and Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07624v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many real-world applications involving static environments, the spatial layout of objects remains consistent across instances. However, state-of-the-art object detection models often fail to leverage this spatial prior, resulting in inconsistent predictions, missed detections, or misclassifications, particularly in cluttered or occluded scenes. In this work, we propose a graph-based post-processing pipeline that explicitly models the spatial relationships between objects to correct detection anomalies in egocentric frames. Using a graph neural network (GNN) trained on manually annotated data, our model identifies invalid object class labels and predicts corrected class labels based on their neighbourhood context. We evaluate our approach both as a standalone anomaly detection and correction framework and as a post-processing module for standard object detectors such as YOLOv7 and RT-DETR. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating this spatial reasoning significantly improves detection performance, with mAP@50 gains of up to 4%. This method highlights the potential of leveraging the environment's spatial structure to improve reliability in object detection systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic Acceleration of MILP Motion Planning with Temporal Logic and Chance Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07515v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous systems must solve motion planning problems subject to increasingly complex, time-sensitive, and uncertain missions. These problems often involve high-level task specifications, such as temporal logic or chance constraints, which require solving large-scale Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs). However, existing MILP-based planning methods suffer from high computational cost and limited scalability, hindering their real-time applicability. We propose to use a neuro-symbolic approach to accelerate MILP-based motion planning by leveraging machine learning techniques to guide the solver's symbolic search. Focusing on two representative classes of planning problems, namely, those with Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications and those with chance constraints formulated via Conformal Predictive Programming (CPP). We demonstrate how graph neural network-based learning methods can guide traditional symbolic MILP solvers in solving challenging planning problems, including branching variable selection and solver parameter configuration. Through extensive experiments, we show that neuro-symbolic search techniques yield scalability gains. Our approach yields substantial improvements, achieving an average performance gain of about 20% over state-of-the-art solver across key metrics, including runtime and solution quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extracting Overlapping Microservices from Monolithic Code via Deep Semantic Embeddings and Graph Neural Network-Based Soft Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07486v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software systems are increasingly shifting from monolithic architectures to microservices to enhance scalability, maintainability, and deployment flexibility. Existing microservice extraction methods typically rely on hard clustering, assigning each software component to a single microservice. This approach often increases inter-service coupling and reduces intra-service cohesion. We propose Mo2oM (Monolithic to Overlapping Microservices), a framework that formulates microservice extraction as a soft clustering problem, allowing components to belong probabilistically to multiple microservices. This approach is inspired by expert-driven decompositions, where practitioners intentionally replicate certain software components across services to reduce communication overhead. Mo2oM combines deep semantic embeddings with structural dependencies extracted from methodcall graphs to capture both functional and architectural relationships. A graph neural network-based soft clustering algorithm then generates the final set of microservices. We evaluate Mo2oM on four open-source monolithic benchmarks and compare it against eight state-of-the-art baselines. Our results demonstrate that Mo2oM achieves improvements of up to 40.97% in structural modularity (balancing cohesion and coupling), 58% in inter-service call percentage (communication overhead), 26.16% in interface number (modularity and decoupling), and 38.96% in non-extreme distribution (service size balance) across all benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[MOTGNN: Interpretable Graph Neural Networks for Multi-Omics Disease Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07465v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating multi-omics data, such as DNA methylation, mRNA expression, and microRNA (miRNA) expression, offers a comprehensive view of the biological mechanisms underlying disease. However, the high dimensionality and complex interactions among omics layers present major challenges for predictive modeling. We propose Multi-Omics integration with Tree-generated Graph Neural Network (MOTGNN), a novel and interpretable framework for binary disease classification. MOTGNN employs eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to perform omics-specific supervised graph construction, followed by modality-specific Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for hierarchical representation learning, and a deep feedforward network for cross-omics integration. On three real-world disease datasets, MOTGNN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 5-10% in accuracy, ROC-AUC, and F1-score, and remains robust to severe class imbalance (e.g., 87.2% vs. 33.4% F1 on imbalanced data). The model maintains computational efficiency through sparse graphs (2.1-2.8 edges per node) and provides built-in interpretability, revealing both top-ranked biomarkers and the relative contributions of each omics modality. These results highlight MOTGNN's potential to improve both predictive accuracy and interpretability in multi-omics disease modeling.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[HSA-Net: Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Framework for Efficient and Scalable Molecular Language Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08334v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular representation learning, a cornerstone for downstream tasks like molecular captioning and molecular property prediction, heavily relies on Graph Neural Networks (GNN). However, GNN suffers from the over-smoothing problem, where node-level features collapse in deep GNN layers. While existing feature projection methods with cross-attention have been introduced to mitigate this issue, they still perform poorly in deep features. This motivated our exploration of using Mamba as an alternative projector for its ability to handle complex sequences. However, we observe that while Mamba excels at preserving global topological information from deep layers, it neglects fine-grained details in shallow layers. The capabilities of Mamba and cross-attention exhibit a global-local trade-off. To resolve this critical global-local trade-off, we propose Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Network (HSA-Net), a novel framework with two modules that enables a hierarchical feature projection and fusion. Firstly, a Hierarchical Adaptive Projector (HAP) module is introduced to process features from different graph layers. It learns to dynamically switch between a cross-attention projector for shallow layers and a structure-aware Graph-Mamba projector for deep layers, producing high-quality, multi-level features. Secondly, to adaptively merge these multi-level features, we design a Source-Aware Fusion (SAF) module, which flexibly selects fusion experts based on the characteristics of the aggregation features, ensuring a precise and effective final representation fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HSA-Net framework quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bidirectional Hierarchical Protein Multi-Modal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04770v2)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Protein representation learning is critical for numerous biological tasks. Recently, large transformer-based protein language models (pLMs) pretrained on large scale protein sequences have demonstrated significant success in sequence-based tasks. However, pLMs lack structural context. Conversely, graph neural networks (GNNs) designed to leverage 3D structural information have shown promising generalization in protein-related prediction tasks, but their effectiveness is often constrained by the scarcity of labeled structural data. Recognizing that sequence and structural representations are complementary perspectives of the same protein entity, we propose a multimodal bidirectional hierarchical fusion framework to effectively merge these modalities. Our framework employs attention and gating mechanisms to enable effective interaction between pLMs-generated sequential representations and GNN-extracted structural features, improving information exchange and enhancement across layers of the neural network. This bidirectional and hierarchical (Bi-Hierarchical) fusion approach leverages the strengths of both modalities to capture richer and more comprehensive protein representations. Based on the framework, we further introduce local Bi-Hierarchical Fusion with gating and global Bi-Hierarchical Fusion with multihead self-attention approaches. Our method demonstrates consistent improvements over strong baselines and existing fusion techniques in a variety of protein representation learning benchmarks, including enzyme EC classification, model quality assessment, protein-ligand binding affinity prediction, protein-protein binding site prediction, and B cell epitopes prediction. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art for multimodal protein representation learning, emphasizing the efficacy of Bi-Hierarchical Fusion in bridging sequence and structural modalities.</p></details> |  |

A theory-driven GNN with seven functional nodes was built. Performance was evaluated via intra-subject (80/20 split) and leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSOCV). GNNExplainer was used for interpretability.Results: The model achieved high intra-subject accuracy (>85%) and significantly above-chance cross-subject performance (approximately73.7%). Explainability analysis revealed a key finding: during NSSI states, a critical feedback loop regulating somatic sensation exhibits dysfunction and directional reversal. Specifically, the brain loses its ability to self-correct via negative bodily feedback, and the regulatory mechanism enters an "ineffective idling" state.Conclusion: This work demonstrates the feasibility of applying theory-guided GNNs to sparse, single-channel EEG for decoding complex mental states. The identified "feedback loop reversal" offers a novel, dynamic, and computable model of NSSI mechanisms, paving the way for objective biomarkers and next-generation Digital Therapeutics (DTx).</p></details> |  |
