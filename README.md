| **[Pre-trained Forecasting Models: Strong Zero-Shot Feature Extractors for Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26777v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research on time series foundation models has primarily focused on forecasting, leaving it unclear how generalizable their learned representations are. In this study, we examine whether frozen pre-trained forecasting models can provide effective representations for classification. To this end, we compare different representation extraction strategies and introduce two model-agnostic embedding augmentations. Our experiments show that the best forecasting models achieve classification accuracy that matches or even surpasses that of state-of-the-art models pre-trained specifically for classification. Moreover, we observe a positive correlation between forecasting and classification performance. These findings challenge the assumption that task-specific pre-training is necessary, and suggest that learning to forecast may provide a powerful route toward constructing general-purpose time series foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Recent Advances in Time Series Foundation Models (BERT2S)</p></details> |
| **[MSAD: A Deep Dive into Model Selection for Time series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26643v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is a fundamental task for time series analytics with important implications for the downstream performance of many applications. Despite increasing academic interest and the large number of methods proposed in the literature, recent benchmarks and evaluation studies demonstrated that no overall best anomaly detection methods exist when applied to very heterogeneous time series datasets. Therefore, the only scalable and viable solution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected from diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select, based on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to run. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to time series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based approaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper studies the performance of time series classification methods used as model selection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations derived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we propose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series classification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results demonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly detection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution time. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and represents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection step in general AutoML pipelines.

| **[Quantum Gated Recurrent GAN with Gaussian Uncertainty for Network Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26487v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in time-series data is a critical challenge with significant implications for network security. Recent quantum machine learning approaches, such as quantum kernel methods and variational quantum circuits, have shown promise in capturing complex data distributions for anomaly detection but remain constrained by limited qubit counts. We introduce in this work a novel Quantum Gated Recurrent Unit (QGRU)-based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) employing Successive Data Injection (SuDaI) and a multi-metric gating strategy for robust network anomaly detection. Our model uniquely utilizes a quantum-enhanced generator that outputs parameters (mean and log-variance) of a Gaussian distribution via reparameterization, combined with a Wasserstein critic to stabilize adversarial training. Anomalies are identified through a novel gating mechanism that initially flags potential anomalies based on Gaussian uncertainty estimates and subsequently verifies them using a composite of critic scores and reconstruction errors. Evaluated on benchmark datasets, our method achieves a high time-series aware F1 score (TaF1) of 89.43% demonstrating superior capability in detecting anomalies accurately and promptly as compared to existing classical and quantum models. Furthermore, the trained QGRU-WGAN was deployed on real IBM Quantum hardware, where it retained high anomaly detection performance, confirming its robustness and practical feasibility on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering Causal Relationships Between Time Series With Spatial Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26485v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery is the subfield of causal inference concerned with estimating the structure of cause-and-effect relationships in a system of interrelated variables, as opposed to quantifying the strength of causal effects. As interest in causal discovery builds in fields such as ecology, public health, and environmental sciences where data is regularly collected with spatial and temporal structures, approaches must evolve to manage autocorrelation and complex confounding. As it stands, the few proposed causal discovery algorithms for spatiotemporal data require summarizing across locations, ignore spatial autocorrelation, and/or scale poorly to high dimensions. Here, we introduce our developing framework that extends time-series causal discovery to systems with spatial structure, building upon work on causal discovery across contexts and methods for handling spatial confounding in causal effect estimation. We close by outlining remaining gaps in the literature and directions for future research.</p></details> | 14 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Extreme Value Analysis based on Blockwise Top-Two Order Statistics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15036v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extreme value analysis for time series is often based on the block maxima method, in particular for environmental applications. In the classical univariate case, the latter is based on fitting an extreme-value distribution to the sample of (annual) block maxima. Mathematically, the target parameters of the extreme-value distribution also show up in limit results for other high order statistics, which suggests estimation based on blockwise large order statistics. It is shown that a naive approach based on maximizing an independence log-likelihood yields an estimator that is inconsistent in general. A consistent, bias-corrected estimator is proposed, and is analyzed theoretically and in finite-sample simulation studies. The new estimator is shown to be more efficient than traditional counterparts, for instance for estimating large return levels or return periods.</p></details> | 92 pages |
| **[Towards Explainable and Reliable AI in Finance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26353v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial forecasting increasingly uses large neural network models, but their opacity raises challenges for trust and regulatory compliance. We present several approaches to explainable and reliable AI in finance. \emph{First}, we describe how Time-LLM, a time series foundation model, uses a prompt to avoid a wrong directional forecast. \emph{Second}, we show that combining foundation models for time series forecasting with a reliability estimator can filter our unreliable predictions. \emph{Third}, we argue for symbolic reasoning encoding domain rules for transparent justification. These approaches shift emphasize executing only forecasts that are both reliable and explainable. Experiments on equity and cryptocurrency data show that the architecture reduces false positives and supports selective execution. By integrating predictive performance with reliability estimation and rule-based reasoning, our framework advances transparent and auditable financial AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[AIMeter: Measuring, Analyzing, and Visualizing Energy and Carbon Footprint of AI Workloads](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20535v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), has raised significant concerns about the energy use and carbon emissions associated with model training and inference. However, existing tools for measuring and reporting such impacts are often fragmented, lacking systematic metric integration and offering limited support for correlation analysis among them. This paper presents AIMeter, a comprehensive software toolkit for the measurement, analysis, and visualization of energy use, power draw, hardware performance, and carbon emissions across AI workloads. By seamlessly integrating with existing AI frameworks, AIMeter offers standardized reports and exports fine-grained time-series data to support benchmarking and reproducibility in a lightweight manner. It further enables in-depth correlation analysis between hardware metrics and model performance and thus facilitates bottleneck identification and performance enhancement. By addressing critical limitations in existing tools, AIMeter encourages the research community to weigh environmental impact alongside raw performance of AI workloads and advances the shift toward more sustainable "Green AI" practices.

| **[Segmentation over Complexity: Evaluating Ensemble and Hybrid Approaches for Anomaly Detection in Industrial Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26159v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of advanced feature engineering and hybrid model architectures for anomaly detection in a multivariate industrial time series, focusing on a steam turbine system. We evaluate the impact of change point-derived statistical features, clustering-based substructure representations, and hybrid learning strategies on detection performance. Despite their theoretical appeal, these complex approaches consistently underperformed compared to a simple Random Forest + XGBoost ensemble trained on segmented data. The ensemble achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.976, F1-score of 0.41, and 100% early detection within the defined time window. Our findings highlight that, in scenarios with highly imbalanced and temporally uncertain data, model simplicity combined with optimized segmentation can outperform more sophisticated architectures, offering greater robustness, interpretability, and operational utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review for presentation at the IEEE SAMI 2026 Conference</p></details> |
| **[New Money: A Systematic Review of Synthetic Data Generation for Finance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26076v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising approach to address the challenges of using sensitive financial data in machine learning applications. By leveraging generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), it is possible to create artificial datasets that preserve the statistical properties of real financial records while mitigating privacy risks and regulatory constraints. Despite the rapid growth of this field, a comprehensive synthesis of the current research landscape has been lacking. This systematic review consolidates and analyses 72 studies published since 2018 that focus on synthetic financial data generation. We categorise the types of financial information synthesised, the generative methods employed, and the evaluation strategies used to assess data utility and privacy. The findings indicate that GAN-based approaches dominate the literature, particularly for generating time-series market data and tabular credit data. While several innovative techniques demonstrate potential for improved realism and privacy preservation, there remains a notable lack of rigorous evaluation of privacy safeguards across studies. By providing an integrated overview of generative techniques, applications, and evaluation methods, this review highlights critical research gaps and offers guidance for future work aimed at developing robust, privacy-preserving synthetic data solutions for the financial domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 5 figures, 21 tables</p></details> |
| **[Time Weaver: A Conditional Time Series Generation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02682v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imagine generating a city's electricity demand pattern based on weather, the presence of an electric vehicle, and location, which could be used for capacity planning during a winter freeze. Such real-world time series are often enriched with paired heterogeneous contextual metadata (e.g., weather and location). Current approaches to time series generation often ignore this paired metadata. Additionally, the heterogeneity in metadata poses several practical challenges in adapting existing conditional generation approaches from the image, audio, and video domains to the time series domain. To address this gap, we introduce TIME WEAVER, a novel diffusion-based model that leverages the heterogeneous metadata in the form of categorical, continuous, and even time-variant variables to significantly improve time series generation. Additionally, we show that naive extensions of standard evaluation metrics from the image to the time series domain are insufficient. These metrics do not penalize conditional generation approaches for their poor specificity in reproducing the metadata-specific features in the generated time series. Thus, we innovate a novel evaluation metric that accurately captures the specificity of conditional generation and the realism of the generated time series. We show that TIME WEAVER outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by up to 30% in downstream classification tasks on real-world energy, medical, air quality, and traffic datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Posterior Sampling: Time Series Generation with Hard Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12652v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating realistic time series samples is crucial for stress-testing models and protecting user privacy by using synthetic data. In engineering and safety-critical applications, these samples must meet certain hard constraints that are domain-specific or naturally imposed by physics or nature. Consider, for example, generating electricity demand patterns with constraints on peak demand times. This can be used to stress-test the functioning of power grids during adverse weather conditions. Existing approaches for generating constrained time series are either not scalable or degrade sample quality. To address these challenges, we introduce Constrained Posterior Sampling (CPS), a diffusion-based sampling algorithm that aims to project the posterior mean estimate into the constraint set after each denoising update. Notably, CPS scales to a large number of constraints ($\sim100$) without requiring additional training. We provide theoretical justifications highlighting the impact of our projection step on sampling. Empirically, CPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in sample quality and similarity to real time series by around 70\% and 22\%, respectively, on real-world stocks, traffic, and air quality datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Infinite-dimensional Mahalanobis Distance with Applications to Kernelized Novelty Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11873v3)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Mahalanobis distance is a classical tool used to measure the covariance-adjusted distance between points in $\bbR^d$. In this work, we extend the concept of Mahalanobis distance to separable Banach spaces by reinterpreting it as a Cameron-Martin norm associated with a probability measure. This approach leads to a basis-free, data-driven notion of anomaly distance through the so-called variance norm, which can naturally be estimated using empirical measures of a sample. Our framework generalizes the classical $\bbR^d$, functional $(L^2[0,1])^d$, and kernelized settings; importantly, it incorporates non-injective covariance operators. We prove that the variance norm is invariant under invertible bounded linear transformations of the data, extending previous results which are limited to unitary operators. In the Hilbert space setting, we connect the variance norm to the RKHS of the covariance operator, and establish consistency and convergence results for estimation using empirical measures with Tikhonov regularization. Using the variance norm, we introduce the notion of a kernelized nearest-neighbour Mahalanobis distance, and study some of its finite-sample concentration properties. In an empirical study on 12 real-world data sets, we demonstrate that the kernelized nearest-neighbour Mahalanobis distance outperforms the traditional kernelized Mahalanobis distance for multivariate time series novelty detection, using state-of-the-art time series kernels such as the signature, global alignment, and Volterra reservoir kernels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Stochastic Flows: Solver-Free Modelling and Inference for SDE Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25769v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are well suited to modelling noisy and irregularly sampled time series found in finance, physics, and machine learning. Traditional approaches require costly numerical solvers to sample between arbitrary time points. We introduce Neural Stochastic Flows (NSFs) and their latent variants, which directly learn (latent) SDE transition laws using conditional normalising flows with architectural constraints that preserve properties inherited from stochastic flows. This enables one-shot sampling between arbitrary states and yields up to two orders of magnitude speed-ups at large time gaps. Experiments on synthetic SDE simulations and on real-world tracking and video data show that NSFs maintain distributional accuracy comparable to numerical approaches while dramatically reducing computation for arbitrary time-point sampling.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (poster).

| **[Detecting sub-populations in online health communities: A mixed-methods exploration of breastfeeding messages in BabyCenter Birth Clubs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23692v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parental stress is a nationwide health crisis according to the U.S. Surgeon General's 2024 advisory. To allay stress, expecting parents seek advice and share experiences in a variety of venues, from in-person birth education classes and parenting groups to virtual communities, for example, BabyCenter, a moderated online forum community with over 4 million members in the United States alone. In this study, we aim to understand how parents talk about pregnancy, birth, and parenting by analyzing 5.43M posts and comments from the April 2017--January 2024 cohort of 331,843 BabyCenter "birth club" users (that is, users who participate in due date forums or "birth clubs" based on their babies' due dates). Using BERTopic to locate breastfeeding threads and LDA to summarize themes, we compare documents in breastfeeding threads to all other birth-club content. Analyzing time series of word rank, we find that posts and comments containing anxiety-related terms increased steadily from April 2017 to January 2024. We used an ensemble of topic models to identify dominant breastfeeding topics within birth clubs, and then explored trends among all user content versus those who posted in threads related to breastfeeding topics. We conducted Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling to identify the most common topics in the full population, as well as within the subset breastfeeding population. We find that the topic of sleep dominates in content generated by the breastfeeding population, as well anxiety-related and work/daycare topics that are not predominant in the full BabyCenter birth club dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Convolutional Spiking-based GRU Cell for Spatio-temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25696v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spike-based temporal messaging enables SNNs to efficiently process both purely temporal and spatio-temporal time-series or event-driven data. Combining SNNs with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), a variant of recurrent neural networks, gives rise to a robust framework for sequential data processing; however, traditional RNNs often lose local details when handling long sequences. Previous approaches, such as SpikGRU, fail to capture fine-grained local dependencies in event-based spatio-temporal data. In this paper, we introduce the Convolutional Spiking GRU (CS-GRU) cell, which leverages convolutional operations to preserve local structure and dependencies while integrating the temporal precision of spiking neurons with the efficient gating mechanisms of GRUs. This versatile architecture excels on both temporal datasets (NTIDIGITS, SHD) and spatio-temporal benchmarks (MNIST, DVSGesture, CIFAR10DVS). Our experiments show that CS-GRU outperforms state-of-the-art GRU variants by an average of 4.35%, achieving over 90% accuracy on sequential tasks and up to 99.31% on MNIST. It is worth noting that our solution achieves 69% higher efficiency compared to SpikGRU.

| **[PyDPF: A Python Package for Differentiable Particle Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25693v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-space models (SSMs) are a widely used tool in time series analysis. In the complex systems that arise from real-world data, it is common to employ particle filtering (PF), an efficient Monte Carlo method for estimating the hidden state corresponding to a sequence of observations. Applying particle filtering requires specifying both the parametric form and the parameters of the system, which are often unknown and must be estimated. Gradient-based optimisation techniques cannot be applied directly to standard particle filters, as the filters themselves are not differentiable. However, several recently proposed methods modify the resampling step to make particle filtering differentiable. In this paper, we present an implementation of several such differentiable particle filters (DPFs) with a unified API built on the popular PyTorch framework. Our implementation makes these algorithms easily accessible to a broader research community and facilitates straightforward comparison between them. We validate our framework by reproducing experiments from several existing studies and demonstrate how DPFs can be applied to address several common challenges with state space modelling.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 0 figures, under review at the Journal of Statistical Software, the python package can be found at https://pypi.org/project/pydpf/ , the full documentation at https://python-dpf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#documentation-index , and the source code including experiments and replication material at https://github.com/John-JoB/pydpf</p></details> |
| **[Quantizing Space and Time: Fusing Time Series and Images for Earth Observation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23118v3)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a task-agnostic framework for multimodal fusion of time series and single timestamp images, enabling cross-modal generation and robust downstream performance. Our approach explores deterministic and learned strategies for time series quantization and then leverages a masked correlation learning objective, aligning discrete image and time series tokens in a unified representation space. Instantiated in the Earth observation domain, the pretrained model generates consistent global temperature profiles from satellite imagery and is validated through counterfactual experiments. Across downstream tasks, our task-agnostic pretraining outperforms task-specific fusion by 6% in R^2 and 2% in RMSE on average, and exceeds baseline methods by 50% in R^2 and 12% in RMSE. Finally, we analyze gradient sensitivity across modalities, providing insights into model robustness. Code, data, and weights will be released under a permissive license.</p></details> |  |
| **[Group Interventions on Deep Networks for Causal Discovery in Subsystems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23906v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery uncovers complex relationships between variables, enhancing predictions, decision-making, and insights into real-world systems, especially in nonlinear multivariate time series. However, most existing methods primarily focus on pairwise cause-effect relationships, overlooking interactions among groups of variables, i.e., subsystems and their collective causal influence. In this study, we introduce gCDMI, a novel multi-group causal discovery method that leverages group-level interventions on trained deep neural networks and employs model invariance testing to infer causal relationships. Our approach involves three key steps. First, we use deep learning to jointly model the structural relationships among groups of all time series. Second, we apply group-wise interventions to the trained model. Finally, we conduct model invariance testing to determine the presence of causal links among variable groups. We evaluate our method on simulated datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in identifying group-level causal relationships compared to existing methods. Additionally, we validate our approach on real-world datasets, including brain networks and climate ecosystems. Our results highlight that applying group-level interventions to deep learning models, combined with invariance testing, can effectively reveal complex causal structures, offering valuable insights for domains such as neuroscience and climate science.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Access.

This paper presents TempoPFN, a univariate time series foundation model based on linear Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data. The model uses a GatedDeltaProduct architecture with state-weaving for fully parallelizable training across sequence lengths, eliminating the need for windowing or summarization techniques while maintaining robust temporal state-tracking. Our comprehensive synthetic data pipeline unifies diverse generators, including stochastic differential equations, Gaussian processes, and audio synthesis, with novel augmentations. In zero-shot evaluations on the Gift-Eval benchmark, TempoPFN achieves top-tier competitive performance, outperforming all existing synthetic-only approaches and surpassing the vast majority of models trained on real-world data, while being more efficient than existing baselines by leveraging fully parallelizable training and inference. We open-source our complete data generation pipeline and training code, providing a reproducible foundation for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 18 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

We present a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series recorded while four subjects watched almost 80 hours of movies provided by the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Modality-specific bidirectional RNNs encode temporal dynamics; their hidden states are fused and passed to a second recurrent layer, and lightweight subject-specific heads output responses for 1000 cortical parcels. Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions. Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r = 0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject (Subject 5). The approach establishes a simple, extensible baseline for future multimodal brain-encoding benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, 1 table.

| **[Asymmetric Huber Periodogram](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25316v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel spectral M-estimator, called the asymmetric Huber periodogram (AHP), for periodicity detection in time series. The AHP is constructed from trigonometric asymmetric Huber regression, where a specially designed check function is used to substitute the squared L2 norm that defines the ordinary periodogram (PG). The AHP is statistically more efficient than the quantile periodogram (QP), while offering a more comprehensive picture than the Huber periodogram (HP) by examining the data across the entire range of the asymmetric parameter. We prove the theoretical properties of the AHP and investigate the relationship between the AHP and the so-called asymmetric Huber spectrum (AHS). Finally, simulations and three real-world data examples demonstrate that the AHP's capability in detecting periodicity and its robustness against outliers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving time series estimation and prediction via transfer learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25236v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are many time series in the literature with high dimension yet limited sample sizes, such as macroeconomic variables, and it is almost impossible to obtain efficient estimation and accurate prediction by using the corresponding datasets themselves. This paper fills the gap by introducing a novel representation-based transfer learning framework for vector autoregressive models, and information from related source datasets with rich observations can be leveraged to enhance estimation efficiency through representation learning. A two-stage regularized estimation procedure is proposed with well established non-asymptotic properties, and algorithms with alternating updates are suggested to search for the estimates. Our transfer learning framework can handle time series with varying sample sizes and asynchronous starting and/or ending time points, thereby offering remarkable flexibility in integrating information from diverse datasets. Simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the finite-sample performance of the proposed methodology, and its usefulness is demonstrated by an empirical analysis on 20 macroeconomic variables from Japan and another nine countries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enlightenment Period Improving DNN Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01737v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The start of deep neural network training is characterized by a brief yet critical phase that lasts from the beginning of the training until the accuracy reaches approximately 50\%. During this phase, disordered representations rapidly transition toward ordered structure, and we term this phase the Enlightenment Period. Through theoretical modeling based on phase transition theory and experimental validation, we reveal that applying Mixup data augmentation during this phase has a dual effect: it introduces a Gradient Interference Effect that hinders performance, while also providing a beneficial Activation Revival Effect to restore gradient updates for saturated neurons. We further demonstrate that this negative interference diminishes as the sample set size or the model parameter size increases, thereby shifting the balance between these two effects. Based on these findings, we propose three strategies that improve performance by solely adjusting the training data distribution within this brief period: the Mixup Pause Strategy for small-scale scenarios, the Alpha Boost Strategy for large-scale scenarios with underfitting, and the High-Loss Removal Strategy for tasks where Mixup is inapplicable (e.g., time series and large language models). Extensive experiments show that these strategies achieve superior performance across diverse architectures such as ViT and ResNet on datasets including CIFAR and ImageNet-1K. Ultimately, this work offers a novel perspective on enhancing model performance by strategically capitalizing on the dynamics of the brief and crucial early stages of training.

| **[NeuroPathNet: Dynamic Path Trajectory Learning for Brain Functional Connectivity Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24025v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the evolution of brain functional networks over time is of great significance for the analysis of cognitive mechanisms and the diagnosis of neurological diseases. Existing methods often have difficulty in capturing the temporal evolution characteristics of connections between specific functional communities. To this end, this paper proposes a new path-level trajectory modeling framework (NeuroPathNet) to characterize the dynamic behavior of connection pathways between brain functional partitions. Based on medically supported static partitioning schemes (such as Yeo and Smith ICA), we extract the time series of connection strengths between each pair of functional partitions and model them using a temporal neural network. We validate the model performance on three public functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) datasets, and the results show that it outperforms existing mainstream methods in multiple indicators. This study can promote the development of dynamic graph learning methods for brain network analysis, and provide possible clinical applications for the diagnosis of neurological diseases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Selective Learning for Deep Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25207v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benefiting from high capacity for capturing complex temporal patterns, deep learning (DL) has significantly advanced time series forecasting (TSF). However, deep models tend to suffer from severe overfitting due to the inherent vulnerability of time series to noise and anomalies. The prevailing DL paradigm uniformly optimizes all timesteps through the MSE loss and learns those uncertain and anomalous timesteps without difference, ultimately resulting in overfitting. To address this, we propose a novel selective learning strategy for deep TSF. Specifically, selective learning screens a subset of the whole timesteps to calculate the MSE loss in optimization, guiding the model to focus on generalizable timesteps while disregarding non-generalizable ones. Our framework introduces a dual-mask mechanism to target timesteps: (1) an uncertainty mask leveraging residual entropy to filter uncertain timesteps, and (2) an anomaly mask employing residual lower bound estimation to exclude anomalous timesteps. Extensive experiments across eight real-world datasets demonstrate that selective learning can significantly improve the predictive performance for typical state-of-the-art deep models, including 37.4% MSE reduction for Informer, 8.4% for TimesNet, and 6.5% for iTransformer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[State Space and Self-Attention Collaborative Network with Feature Aggregation for DOA Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25193v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for sound sources is challenging due to the continuous changes in acoustic characteristics across time and frequency. In such scenarios, accurate localization relies on the ability to aggregate relevant features and model temporal dependencies effectively. In time series modeling, achieving a balance between model performance and computational efficiency remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose FA-Stateformer, a state space and self-attention collaborative network with feature aggregation. The proposed network first employs a feature aggregation module to enhance informative features across both temporal and spectral dimensions. This is followed by a lightweight Conformer architecture inspired by the squeeze-and-excitation mechanism, where the feedforward layers are compressed to reduce redundancy and parameter overhead. Additionally, a temporal shift mechanism is incorporated to expand the receptive field of convolutional layers while maintaining a compact kernel size. To further enhance sequence modeling capabilities, a bidirectional Mamba module is introduced, enabling efficient state-space-based representation of temporal dependencies in both forward and backward directions. The remaining self-attention layers are combined with the Mamba blocks, forming a collaborative modeling framework that achieves a balance between representation capacity and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FA-Stateformer achieves superior performance and efficiency compared to conventional architectures.</p></details> |  |

Recently, a widely adopted approach has been the incorporation of frequency domain information to assist in long-term prediction tasks. Many researchers have independently observed the spectral bias phenomenon in neural networks, where models tend to fit low-frequency signals before high-frequency ones. However, these observations have often been attributed to the specific architectures designed by the researchers, rather than recognizing the phenomenon as a universal characteristic across models. To unify the understanding of the spectral bias phenomenon in long-term time series prediction, we conducted extensive empirical experiments to measure spectral bias in existing mainstream models. Our findings reveal that virtually all models exhibit this phenomenon. To mitigate the impact of spectral bias, we propose the FreLE (Frequency Loss Enhancement) algorithm, which enhances model generalization through both explicit and implicit frequency regularization. This is a plug-and-play model loss function unit. A large number of experiments have proven the superior performance of FreLE. Code is available at https://github.com/Chenxing-Xuan/FreLE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning through Change Point Detection in Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24988v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) enhances the scalability of decision-making in long-horizon tasks by introducing temporal abstraction through options-policies that span multiple timesteps. Despite its theoretical appeal, the practical implementation of HRL suffers from the challenge of autonomously discovering semantically meaningful subgoals and learning optimal option termination boundaries. This paper introduces a novel architecture that integrates a self-supervised, Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD) module into the Option-Critic framework, enabling adaptive segmentation of state trajectories and the discovery of options. The CPD module is trained using heuristic pseudo-labels derived from intrinsic signals to infer latent shifts in environment dynamics without external supervision. These inferred change-points are leveraged in three critical ways: (i) to serve as supervisory signals for stabilizing termination function gradients, (ii) to pretrain intra-option policies via segment-wise behavioral cloning, and (iii) to enforce functional specialization through inter-option divergence penalties over CPD-defined state partitions. The overall optimization objective enhances the standard actor-critic loss using structure-aware auxiliary losses. In our framework, option discovery arises naturally as CPD-defined trajectory segments are mapped to distinct intra-option policies, enabling the agent to autonomously partition its behavior into reusable, semantically meaningful skills. Experiments on the Four-Rooms and Pinball tasks demonstrate that CPD-guided agents exhibit accelerated convergence, higher cumulative returns, and significantly improved option specialization. These findings confirm that integrating structural priors via change-point segmentation leads to more interpretable, sample-efficient, and robust hierarchical policies in complex environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Expressivity and Scalability with Adaptive Unitary SSMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05238v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has revealed that state space models (SSMs), while efficient for long-sequence processing, are fundamentally limited in their ability to represent formal languages-particularly due to time-invariant and real-valued recurrence structures. In this work, we draw inspiration from adaptive and structured dynamics observed in biological neural systems and introduce the Adaptive Unitary State Space Model (AUSSM), a novel class of SSMs that leverages skew-symmetric, input-dependent recurrence to achieve unitary evolution and high expressive power. Using algebraic automata theory, we prove that AUSSM can perform modulo counting and simulate solvable group automata at finite precision, enabling AUSSM to model a broad class of regular languages out of reach for other SSM architectures. To overcome the practical inefficiencies of adaptive recurrence, we develop a separable convolution formulation and a CUDA implementation that enables scalable parallel training. Empirically, we show that AUSSM and its hybrid variant-interleaved with Mamba-outperform prior SSMs on formal algorithmic tasks such as parity and modular arithmetic, and achieve competent performance on real-world long time-series classification benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that adaptive unitary recurrence provides a powerful and efficient inductive bias for both symbolic and continuous sequence modeling.

It allows users to control the interpretability-expressivity trade-off by grouping features and graphs to encode priors, and it provides feature, node, and graph-level interpretability. On real-world datasets, including mortality prediction from blood tests and fake-news detection, GMAN outperforms strong non-interpretable black-box baselines while delivering actionable, domain-aligned explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2505.19193</p></details> |
| **[Causal Ordering for Structure Learning From Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24639v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting causal structure from time series data is crucial for understanding complex phenomena in physiology, brain connectivity, climate dynamics, and socio-economic behaviour. Causal discovery in time series is hindered by the combinatorial complexity of identifying true causal relationships, especially as the number of variables and time points grow. A common approach to simplify the task is the so-called ordering-based methods. Traditional ordering methods inherently limit the representational capacity of the resulting model. In this work, we fix this issue by leveraging multiple valid causal orderings, instead of a single one as standard practice. We propose DOTS (Diffusion Ordered Temporal Structure), using diffusion-based causal discovery for temporal data. By integrating multiple orderings, DOTS effectively recovers the transitive closure of the underlying directed acyclic graph, mitigating spurious artifacts inherent in single-ordering approaches. We formalise the problem under standard assumptions such as stationarity and the additive noise model, and leverage score matching with diffusion processes to enable efficient Hessian estimation. Extensive experiments validate the approach. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DOTS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a scalable and robust approach to temporal causal discovery. On synthetic benchmarks ($d{=}\!3-\!6$ variables, $T{=}200\!-\!5{,}000$ samples), DOTS improves mean window-graph $F1$ from $0.63$ (best baseline) to $0.81$. On the CausalTime real-world benchmark ($d{=}20\!-\!36$), while baselines remain the best on individual datasets, DOTS attains the highest average summary-graph $F1$ while halving runtime relative to graph-optimisation methods. These results establish DOTS as a scalable and accurate solution for temporal causal discovery.</p></details> | 32 pages |
| **[TableTime: Reformulating Time Series Classification as Training-Free Table Understanding with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15737v4)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in multivariate time series classification (MTSC). Effective adaptation of LLMs for MTSC necessitates informative data representations. Existing LLM-based methods directly encode embeddings for time series within the latent space of LLMs from scratch to align with semantic space of LLMs. Despite their effectiveness, we reveal that these methods conceal three inherent bottlenecks: (1) they struggle to encode temporal and channel-specific information in a lossless manner, both of which are critical components of multivariate time series; (2) it is much difficult to align the learned representation space with the semantic space of the LLMs; (3) they require task-specific retraining, which is both computationally expensive and labor-intensive. To bridge these gaps, we propose TableTime, which reformulates MTSC as a table understanding task. Specifically, TableTime introduces the following strategies: (1) convert multivariate time series into a tabular form, thus minimizing information loss to the greatest extent; (2) represent tabular time series in text format to achieve natural alignment with the semantic space of LLMs; (3) design a reasoning framework that integrates contextual text information, neighborhood assistance, multi-path inference and problem decomposition to enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs and realize zero-shot classification. Extensive experiments performed on 10 publicly representative datasets from UEA archive verify the superiorities of the TableTime.</p></details> |  |
| **[DistDF: Time-Series Forecasting Needs Joint-Distribution Wasserstein Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24574v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training time-series forecast models requires aligning the conditional distribution of model forecasts with that of the label sequence. The standard direct forecast (DF) approach resorts to minimize the conditional negative log-likelihood of the label sequence, typically estimated using the mean squared error. However, this estimation proves to be biased in the presence of label autocorrelation. In this paper, we propose DistDF, which achieves alignment by alternatively minimizing a discrepancy between the conditional forecast and label distributions. Because conditional discrepancies are difficult to estimate from finite time-series observations, we introduce a newly proposed joint-distribution Wasserstein discrepancy for time-series forecasting, which provably upper bounds the conditional discrepancy of interest. This discrepancy admits tractable, differentiable estimation from empirical samples and integrates seamlessly with gradient-based training. Extensive experiments show that DistDF improves the performance diverse forecast models and achieves the state-of-the-art forecasting performance.

| **[TokenTiming: A Dynamic Alignment Method for Universal Speculative Decoding Model Pairs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15545v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs) has been a critical challenge in generative AI. Speculative decoding (SD) substantially improves LLM inference efficiency. However, its utility is limited by a fundamental constraint: the draft and target models must share the same vocabulary, thus limiting the herd of available draft models and often necessitating the training of a new model from scratch. Inspired by Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a classic algorithm for aligning time series, we propose the algorithm TokenTiming for universal speculative decoding. It operates by re-encoding the draft token sequence to get a new target token sequence, and then uses DTW to build a mapping to transfer the probability distributions for speculative sampling. Benefiting from this, our method accommodates mismatched vocabularies and works with any off-the-shelf models without retraining and modification. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various tasks, demonstrating 1.57x speedup. This work enables a universal approach for draft model selection, making SD a more versatile and practical tool for LLM acceleration.</p></details> |  |

The origin of dark matter is one of the most important questions in contemporary physics, and a convincing detection of dark matter would be a Nobel-Prize-level breakthrough in fundamental science. The ABRACADABRA experiment was specifically designed to search for dark matter. Although it has not yet made a discovery, ABRACADABRA has produced several dark matter search results widely endorsed by the physics community. The experiment generates ultra-long time-series data at a rate of 10 million samples per second, where the dark matter signal would manifest itself as a sinusoidal oscillation mode within the ultra-long time series. In this paper, we present the TIDMAD -- a comprehensive data release from the ABRACADABRA experiment including three key components: an ultra-long time series dataset divided into training, validation, and science subsets; a carefully-designed denoising score for direct model benchmarking; and a complete analysis framework which produces a community-standard dark matter search result suitable for publication as a physics paper. This data release enables core AI algorithms to extract the dark matter signal and produce real physics results thereby advancing fundamental science.

Two unique challenges stand out: (1) efficiently and accurately forecasting time series or detecting anomalies in large volumes automatically; and (2) ensuring interpretability of results to effectively incorporate business insights. We present ARIMA_PLUS, a novel framework to overcome these two challenges by a unique combination of (a) accurate and interpretable time series models and (b) scalable and fully managed system infrastructure. The model has a sequential and modular structure to handle different components of the time series, including holiday effects, seasonality, trend, and anomalies, which enables high interpretability of the results. Novel enhancements are made to each module, and a unified framework is established to address both forecasting and anomaly detection tasks simultaneously. In terms of accuracy, its comprehensive benchmark on the 42 public datasets in the Monash forecasting repository shows superior performance over not only well-established statistical alternatives (such as ETS, ARIMA, TBATS, Prophet) but also newer neural network models (such as DeepAR, N-BEATS, PatchTST, TimeMixer). In terms of infrastructure, it is directly built into the query engine of BigQuery in Google Cloud. It uses a simple SQL interface and automates tedious technicalities such as data cleaning and model selection. It automatically scales with managed cloud computational and storage resources, making it possible to forecast 100 million time series using only 1.5 hours with a throughput of more than 18000 time series per second. In terms of interpretability, we present several case studies to demonstrate time series insights it generates and customizability it offers.</p></details> |  |

We hypothesize that temporal resolution is a fundamental axis of representation learning, with different clinical and behavioral outcomes relying on structure at distinct scales. To test this resolution hypothesis, we introduce HiMAE (Hierarchical Masked Autoencoder), a self supervised framework that combines masked autoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder decoder. HiMAE produces multi resolution embeddings that enable systematic evaluation of which temporal scales carry predictive signal, transforming resolution from a hyperparameter into a probe for interpretability. Across classification, regression, and generative benchmarks, HiMAE consistently outperforms state of the art foundation models that collapse scale, while being orders of magnitude smaller. HiMAE is an efficient representation learner compact enough to run entirely on watch, achieving sub millisecond inference on smartwatch class CPUs for true edge inference. Together, these contributions position HiMAE as both an efficient self supervised learning method and a discovery tool for scale sensitive structure in wearable health.</p></details> |  |
| **[50 Years of Water Body Monitoring: The Case of Qaraaoun Reservoir, Lebanon](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24413v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sustainable management of the Qaraaoun Reservoir, the largest surface water body in Lebanon located in the Bekaa Plain, depends on reliable monitoring of its storage volume despite frequent sensor malfunctions and limited maintenance capacity. This study introduces a sensor-free approach that integrates open-source satellite imagery, advanced water-extent segmentation, and machine learning to estimate the reservoir surface area and volume in near real time. Sentinel-2 and Landsat images are processed, where surface water is delineated using a newly proposed water segmentation index. A machine learning model based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) is trained on a curated dataset that includes water surface area, water level, and water volume calculations using a reservoir bathymetry survey. The model is then able to estimate reservoir volume relying solely on surface area extracted from satellite imagery, without the need for ground measurements. Water segmentation using the proposed index aligns with ground truth for more than 95 percent of the shoreline. Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV yields an optimized SVR performance with error under 1.5 percent of full reservoir capacity and coefficients of determination exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate the robustness and cost-effectiveness of the method, offering a practical solution for continuous, sensor-independent monitoring of reservoir storage. The proposed methodology can be replicated for other water bodies, and the resulting 50 years of time-series data is valuable for research on climate change and environmental patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Closing Gaps: An Imputation Analysis of ICU Vital Signs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24217v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As more Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data becomes available, the interest in developing clinical prediction models to improve healthcare protocols increases. However, the lack of data quality still hinders clinical prediction using Machine Learning (ML). Many vital sign measurements, such as heart rate, contain sizeable missing segments, leaving gaps in the data that could negatively impact prediction performance. Previous works have introduced numerous time-series imputation techniques. Nevertheless, more comprehensive work is needed to compare a representative set of methods for imputing ICU vital signs and determine the best practice. In reality, ad-hoc imputation techniques that could decrease prediction accuracy, like zero imputation, are still used. In this work, we compare established imputation techniques to guide researchers in improving the performance of clinical prediction models by selecting the most accurate imputation technique. We introduce an extensible and reusable benchmark with currently 15 imputation and 4 amputation methods, created for benchmarking on major ICU datasets. We hope to provide a comparative basis and facilitate further ML development to bring more models into clinical practice.</p></details> | Preprint |

We demonstrate that, once trained, such networks exhibit properties analogous to Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters, particularly when the convolutional kernels are of extended length exceeding those typically employed in standard CNN architectures. Causal CNNs are shown to capture spectral features both implicitly and explicitly, offering enhanced interpretability for tasks involving dynamic systems. Leveraging the associative property of convolution, we further show that the entire network can be reduced to an equivalent single-layer filter resembling an FIR filter optimized via least-squares criteria. This equivalence yields new insights into the spectral learning behavior of CNNs trained on signals with sparse frequency content. The approach is validated on both simulated beam dynamics and real-world bridge vibration datasets, underlining its relevance for modeling and identifying physical systems governed by dynamic responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 19 figures, Under review</p></details> |

While the challenges of estimating transfer entropy for continuous data are well known, it has two major shortcomings for data of finite cardinality: it exhibits a substantial positive bias for sparse bin counts, and it has no clear means to assess statistical significance. By computing information content in finite data streams without explicitly considering symbols as instances of random variables, we derive a transfer entropy measure which is asymptotically equivalent to the standard plug-in estimator but remedies these issues for time series of small size and/or high cardinality, permitting a fully nonparametric assessment of statistical significance without simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[OneCast: Structured Decomposition and Modular Generation for Cross-Domain Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24028v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain time series forecasting is a valuable task in various web applications. Despite its rapid advancement, achieving effective generalization across heterogeneous time series data remains a significant challenge. Existing methods have made progress by extending single-domain models, yet often fall short when facing domain-specific trend shifts and inconsistent periodic patterns. We argue that a key limitation lies in treating temporal series as undifferentiated sequence, without explicitly decoupling their inherent structural components. To address this, we propose OneCast, a structured and modular forecasting framework that decomposes time series into seasonal and trend components, each modeled through tailored generative pathways. Specifically, the seasonal component is captured by a lightweight projection module that reconstructs periodic patterns via interpretable basis functions. In parallel, the trend component is encoded into discrete tokens at segment level via a semantic-aware tokenizer, and subsequently inferred through a masked discrete diffusion mechanism. The outputs from both branches are combined to produce a final forecast that captures seasonal patterns while tracking domain-specific trends. Extensive experiments across eight domains demonstrate that OneCast mostly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal Multivariate Time Series Forecast with Chosen Variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24027v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-Temporal Multivariate time series Forecast (STMF) uses the time series of $n$ spatially distributed variables in a period of recent past to forecast their values in a period of near future. It has important applications in spatio-temporal sensing forecast such as road traffic prediction and air pollution prediction. Recent papers have addressed a practical problem of missing variables in the model input, which arises in the sensing applications where the number $m$ of sensors is far less than the number $n$ of locations to be monitored, due to budget constraints. We observe that the state of the art assumes that the $m$ variables (i.e., locations with sensors) in the model input are pre-determined and the important problem of how to choose the $m$ variables in the input has never been studied. This paper fills the gap by studying a new problem of STMF with chosen variables, which optimally selects $m$-out-of-$n$ variables for the model input in order to maximize the forecast accuracy. We propose a unified framework that jointly performs variable selection and model optimization for both forecast accuracy and model efficiency. It consists of three novel technical components: (1) masked variable-parameter pruning, which progressively prunes less informative variables and attention parameters through quantile-based masking; (2) prioritized variable-parameter replay, which replays low-loss past samples to preserve learned knowledge for model stability; (3) dynamic extrapolation mechanism, which propagates information from variables selected for the input to all other variables via learnable spatial embeddings and adjacency information. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that our work significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of joint variable selection and model optimization.</p></details> | In submission |

In this paper, we analyze the scheduling and placement of virtual machines (VMs) in the cloud platform of SAP, the world's largest enterprise resource planning software vendor. Based on data from roughly 1,800 hypervisors and 48,000 VMs within a 30-day observation period, we highlight potential improvements for workload management. The data was measured through observability tooling that tracks resource usage and performance metrics across the entire infrastructure. In contrast to existing datasets, ours uniquely offers fine-grained time-series telemetry data of fully virtualized enterprise-level workloads from both long-running and memory-intensive SAP S/4HANA and diverse, general-purpose applications. Our key findings include several suboptimal scheduling situations, such as CPU resource contention exceeding 40%, CPU ready times of up to 220 seconds, significantly imbalanced compute hosts with a maximum CPU~utilization on intra-building block hosts of up to 99%, and overprovisioned CPU and memory resources resulting into over 80% of VMs using less than 70% of the provided resources. Bolstered by these findings, we derive requirements for the design and implementation of novel placement and scheduling algorithms and provide guidance to optimize resource allocations. We make the full dataset used in this study publicly available to enable data-driven evaluations of scheduling approaches for large-scale cloud infrastructures in future research.</p></details> | 15 pages |

In anomaly detection, anomalies are identified by their large distance from normal data points. However, the performance of these methods often hinges on a single, user-selected distance metric (e.g., Euclidean), which may not be optimal for the complex, high-dimensional feature spaces common in astronomy. Here, we introduce a novel anomaly detection method, Distance Multi-Metric Anomaly Detection (DiMMAD), which uses an ensemble of distance metrics to find novelties. Using multiple distance metrics is effectively equivalent to using different geometries in the feature space. By using a robust ensemble of diverse distance metrics, we overcome the metric-selection problem, creating an anomaly score that is not reliant on any single definition of distance. We demonstrate this multi-metric approach as a tool for simple, interpretable scientific discovery on astronomical time series -- (1) with simulated data for the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, and (2) real data from the Zwicky Transient Facility. We find that DiMMAD excels at out-of-distribution anomaly detection -- anomalies in the data that might be new classes -- and beats other state-of-the-art methods in the goal of maximizing the diversity of new classes discovered. For rare in-distribution anomaly detection, DiMMAD performs similarly to other methods, but may allow for improved interpretability.

However, standard likelihood-based inference methodology for ARMA models has avoidable limitations. We show that currently accepted standards for ARMA likelihood maximization frequently lead to sub-optimal parameter estimates. Existing algorithms have theoretical support, but can result in parameter estimates that correspond to a local optimum. While this possibility has been previously identified, it remains unknown to most users, and no routinely applicable algorithm has been developed to resolve the issue. We introduce a novel random initialization algorithm, designed to take advantage of the structure of the ARMA likelihood function, which overcomes these optimization problems. Additionally, we show that profile likelihoods provide superior confidence intervals to those based on the Fisher information matrix. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through a data analysis example and a series of simulation studies. This work makes a significant contribution to statistical practice by identifying and resolving under-recognized shortcomings of existing procedures that frequently arise in scientific and industrial applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>The d...</summary><p>The developmental version of the R package used in this paper is available at the following GitHub repository: git@github.com:jeswheel/arima2.git.

| **[Parallel BiLSTM-Transformer networks for forecasting chaotic dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23685v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The nonlinear nature of chaotic systems results in extreme sensitivity to initial conditions and highly intricate dynamical behaviors, posing fundamental challenges for accurately predicting their evolution. To overcome the limitation that conventional approaches fail to capture both local features and global dependencies in chaotic time series simultaneously, this study proposes a parallel predictive framework integrating Transformer and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks. The hybrid model employs a dual-branch architecture, where the Transformer branch mainly captures long-range dependencies while the BiLSTM branch focuses on extracting local temporal features. The complementary representations from the two branches are fused in a dedicated feature-fusion layer to enhance predictive accuracy. As illustrating examples, the model's performance is systematically evaluated on two representative tasks in the Lorenz system. The first is autonomous evolution prediction, in which the model recursively extrapolates system trajectories from the time-delay embeddings of the state vector to evaluate long-term tracking accuracy and stability. The second is inference of unmeasured variable, where the model reconstructs the unobserved states from the time-delay embeddings of partial observations to assess its state-completion capability.

However, a recent important paper questioned their effectiveness by demonstrating that a simple single layer linear model outperforms Transformer-based models. This was soon shown to be not as valid, by a better transformer-based model termed PatchTST. More re cently, TimeLLM demonstrated even better results by repurposing a Large Language Model (LLM) for the TSF domain. Again, a follow up paper challenged this by demonstrating that removing the LLM component or replacing it with a basic attention layer in fact yields better performance. One of the challenges in forecasting is the fact that TSF data favors the more recent past, and is sometimes subject to unpredictable events. Based upon these recent insights in TSF, we propose a strong Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. Our method combines the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models including xLSTM, en hanced Linear, PatchTST, and minGRU, among others. This set of complimentary and diverse models for TSF are integrated in a Trans former based MoE gating network. Our proposed model outperforms all existing TSF models on standard benchmarks, surpassing even the latest approaches based on MoE frameworks.</p></details> |  |

While most forecasting literature assumes regularly spaced observations without missing values, many real-world datasets - particularly in healthcare, climate research, and biomechanics - violate these assumptions. Time Series (TS)-mixer models have achieved remarkable success in regular multivariate time series forecasting. However, they remain unexplored for IMTS due to their requirement for complete and evenly spaced observations. To bridge this gap, we introduce IMTS-Mixer, a novel forecasting architecture designed specifically for IMTS. Our approach retains the core principles of TS mixer models while introducing innovative methods to transform IMTS into fixed-size matrix representations, enabling their seamless integration with mixer modules. We evaluate IMTS-Mixer on a benchmark of four real-world datasets from various domains. Our results demonstrate that IMTS-Mixer establishes a new state-of-the-art in forecasting accuracy while also improving computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

| **[Toward Interpretable Evaluation Measures for Time Series Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23261v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series segmentation is a fundamental task in analyzing temporal data across various domains, from human activity recognition to energy monitoring. While numerous state-of-the-art methods have been developed to tackle this problem, the evaluation of their performance remains critically limited. Existing measures predominantly focus on change point accuracy or rely on point-based measures such as Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), which fail to capture the quality of the detected segments, ignore the nature of errors, and offer limited interpretability. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by introducing two novel evaluation measures: WARI (Weighted Adjusted Rand Index), that accounts for the position of segmentation errors, and SMS (State Matching Score), a fine-grained measure that identifies and scores four fundamental types of segmentation errors while allowing error-specific weighting. We empirically validate WARI and SMS on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, showing that they not only provide a more accurate assessment of segmentation quality but also uncover insights, such as error provenance and type, that are inaccessible with traditional measures.</p></details> |  |

However, existing deep learning models face significant challenges of high computational cost and insufficient interpretability due to their complex black-box nature. This paper introduces FlightKooba, a novel modeling approach designed to extract such underlying dynamics analytically. Our framework uniquely integrates HiPPO theory, Koopman operator theory, and control theory. By leveraging Legendre polynomial bases, it constructs Koopman operators analytically, thereby avoiding large-scale parameter training. The method's core strengths lie in its exceptional computational efficiency and inherent interpretability. Experiments on multiple public datasets validate our design philosophy: for signals exhibiting strong periodicity or clear physical laws (e.g., in aviation, meteorology, and traffic flow), FlightKooba delivers competitive prediction accuracy while reducing trainable parameters by several orders of magnitude and achieving the fastest training speed. Furthermore, we analyze the model's theoretical boundaries, clarifying its inherent low-pass filtering characteristics that render it unsuitable for sequences dominated by high-frequency noise. In summary, FlightKooba offers a powerful, efficient, and interpretable new alternative for time series analysis, particularly in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version 2: Major revision of the manuscript to refine the narrative, clarify the model's theoretical limitations and application scope, and improve overall presentation for journal submission</p></details> |

We consider two functional factor structures encompassing either functional factors with scalar loadings or scalar factors with functional loadings, and postulate functional sparsity on the covariance of idiosyncratic errors after taking out the common unobserved factors. To facilitate estimation, we rely on the spiked matrix model and its functional generalization, and derive some novel asymptotic identifiability results, based on which we develop DIGIT and FPOET estimators under two functional factor models, respectively. Both estimators involve performing associated eigenanalysis to estimate the covariance of common components, followed by adaptive functional thresholding applied to the residual covariance. We also develop functional information criteria for model selection with theoretical guarantees. The convergence rates of involved estimated quantities are respectively established for DIGIT and FPOET estimators. Numerical studies including extensive simulations and a real data application on functional portfolio allocation are conducted to examine the finite-sample performance of the proposed methodology.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version is the accepted version by Journal of Econometrics and includes the supplementary material of the paper</p></details> |

Here we propose a regression model that allows for a representation of periodic and dynamic patterns observed in time series data. The model incorporates a hidden strictly positive stochastic process that represents the instantaneous frequency, allowing the model to adapt and accurately capture varying time scales. A case study focusing on age estimation of narwhal tusks is presented, where cyclic element signals associated with annual growth layer groups are analyzed. We apply the methodology to data from one such tusk collected in West Greenland and use the fitted model to estimate the age of the narwhal. The proposed method is validated using simulated signals with known cycle counts and practical considerations and modelling challenges are discussed in detail. This research contributes to the field of time series analysis, providing a tool and valuable insights for understanding and modeling complex cyclic patterns in diverse domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Echo State Transformer: Attention Over Finite Memories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02917v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models and their underlying Transformer architecture are remarkably efficient, they do not reflect how our brain processes and learns a diversity of cognitive tasks such as language and working memory. Furthermore, sequential data processing with Transformers encounters a fundamental barrier: quadratic complexity growth with sequence length. Motivated by these limitations, our ambition is to create more efficient models that are less reliant on intensive computations. We introduce Echo State Transformers (EST), a hybrid architecture that elegantly resolves this challenge while demonstrating exceptional performance in classification and detection tasks. EST integrates the Transformer attention mechanisms with principles from Reservoir Computing to create a fixed-size window distributed memory system. Drawing inspiration from Echo State Networks, the most prominent instance of the Reservoir Computing paradigm, our approach leverages reservoirs (random recurrent networks) as a lightweight and efficient memory. Our architecture integrates a new module called ''Working Memory'' based on several reservoirs working in parallel. These reservoirs work as independent working memory units with distinct internal dynamics. A novelty here is that the classical reservoir hyperparameters, controlling the dynamics, are now trained. Thus, the EST dynamically adapts the reservoir memory/non-linearity trade-off. Thanks to these working memory units, EST achieves constant computational complexity at each processing step, effectively breaking the quadratic scaling problem of standard Transformers. We evaluate ESTs on a recent challenging timeseries benchmark: the Time Series Library, which comprises 69 tasks across five categories. Results show that ESTs ranks first overall in two of five categories, outperforming strong state-of-the-art baselines on classification and anomaly detection tasks, while remaining competitive on short-term forecasting. These results position ESTs as a compelling alternative for time-series classification and anomaly detection, and a practical complement to transformer-style models in applications that prioritize robust representations and sensitive event detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[A method for outlier detection based on cluster analysis and visual expert criteria](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23136v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Outlier detection is an important problem occurring in a wide range of areas. Outliers are the outcome of fraudulent behaviour, mechanical faults, human error, or simply natural deviations. Many data mining applications perform outlier detection, often as a preliminary step in order to filter out outliers and build more representative models. In this paper, we propose an outlier detection method based on a clustering process. The aim behind the proposal outlined in this paper is to overcome the specificity of many existing outlier detection techniques that fail to take into account the inherent dispersion of domain objects. The outlier detection method is based on four criteria designed to represent how human beings (experts in each domain) visually identify outliers within a set of objects after analysing the clusters. This has an advantage over other clustering-based outlier detection techniques that are founded on a purely numerical analysis of clusters. Our proposal has been evaluated, with satisfactory results, on data (particularly time series) from two different domains: stabilometry, a branch of medicine studying balance-related functions in human beings and electroencephalography (EEG), a neurological exploration used to diagnose nervous system disorders. To validate the proposed method, we studied method outlier detection and efficiency in terms of runtime. The results of regression analyses confirm that our proposal is useful for detecting outlier data in different domains, with a false positive rate of less than 2% and a reliability greater than 99%.</p></details> |  |
| **[IKNet: Interpretable Stock Price Prediction via Keyword-Guided Integration of News and Technical Indicators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07661v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing influence of unstructured external information, such as news articles, on stock prices has attracted growing attention in financial markets. Despite recent advances, most existing newsbased forecasting models represent all articles using sentiment scores or average embeddings that capture the general tone but fail to provide quantitative, context-aware explanations of the impacts of public sentiment on predictions. To address this limitation, we propose an interpretable keyword-guided network (IKNet), which is an explainable forecasting framework that models the semantic association between individual news keywords and stock price movements. The IKNet identifies salient keywords via FinBERTbased contextual analysis, processes each embedding through a separate nonlinear projection layer, and integrates their representations with the time-series data of technical indicators to forecast next-day closing prices. By applying Shapley Additive Explanations the model generates quantifiable and interpretable attributions for the contribution of each keyword to predictions. Empirical evaluations of S&P 500 data from 2015 to 2024 demonstrate that IKNet outperforms baselines, including recurrent neural networks and transformer models, reducing RMSE by up to 32.9% and improving cumulative returns by 18.5%. Moreover, IKNet enhances transparency by offering contextualized explanations of volatility events driven by public sentiment.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[MAP4TS: A Multi-Aspect Prompting Framework for Time-Series Forecasting with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23090v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances have investigated the use of pretrained large language models (LLMs) for time-series forecasting by aligning numerical inputs with LLM embedding spaces. However, existing multimodal approaches often overlook the distinct statistical properties and temporal dependencies that are fundamental to time-series data. To bridge this gap, we propose MAP4TS, a novel Multi-Aspect Prompting Framework that explicitly incorporates classical time-series analysis into the prompt design. Our framework introduces four specialized prompt components: a Global Domain Prompt that conveys dataset-level context, a Local Domain Prompt that encodes recent trends and series-specific behaviors, and a pair of Statistical and Temporal Prompts that embed handcrafted insights derived from autocorrelation (ACF), partial autocorrelation (PACF), and Fourier analysis. Multi-Aspect Prompts are combined with raw time-series embeddings and passed through a cross-modality alignment module to produce unified representations, which are then processed by an LLM and projected for final forecasting. Extensive experiments across eight diverse datasets show that MAP4TS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based methods. Our ablation studies further reveal that prompt-aware designs significantly enhance performance stability and that GPT-2 backbones, when paired with structured prompts, outperform larger models like LLaMA in long-term forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |

As cyber threats to these systems escalate, regulatory agencies are imposing stricter compliance requirements to ensure system-wide security and reliability. A central challenge, however, is enabling regulators to verify the effectiveness of detection mechanisms without requiring utilities to disclose sensitive operational data. In this paper, we introduce zkSTAR, a cyberattack detection framework that leverages zk-SNARKs to reconcile these requirements and enable provable detection guarantees while preserving data confidentiality. Our approach builds on established residual-based statistical hypothesis testing methods applied to state-space detection models. Specifically, we design a two-pronged zk-SNARK architecture that enforces temporal consistency of the state-space dynamics and statistical consistency of the detection tests, allowing regulators to temporally verify alarm correctness without visibility into utility-level data. We formally analyze the soundness and zero knowledge properties of our framework and validate its practical feasibility through computational experiments on real-world ICS datasets. As a result, our work demonstrates a scalable, privacy-preserving alternative for regulatory compliance for ICS driven critical infrastructure networks.</p></details> |  |

However, given the numerous models available in the model hub, identifying the most suitable one by individually fine-tuning is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SwiftTS}, a swift selection framework for time series pre-trained models. To avoid expensive forward propagation through all candidates, SwiftTS adopts a learning-guided approach that leverages historical dataset-model performance pairs across diverse horizons to predict model performance on unseen datasets. It employs a lightweight dual-encoder architecture that embeds time series and candidate models with rich characteristics, computing patchwise compatibility scores between data and model embeddings for efficient selection. To further enhance the generalization across datasets and horizons, we introduce a horizon-adaptive expert composition module that dynamically adjusts expert weights, and the transferable cross-task learning with cross-dataset and cross-horizon task sampling to enhance out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness. Extensive experiments on 14 downstream datasets and 8 pre-trained models demonstrate that SwiftTS achieves state-of-the-art performance in time series pre-trained model selection.</p></details> | 10 pages,6 figures |

Non-negativity and summability are constraints that sometimes require modifications of standard linear statistical methods. The centered log-ratio transformation presents a mapping from a constrained to a less constrained space. With a time series of densities, forecasts are more relevant to the recent data than the data from the distant past. We introduce a weighted compositional functional data analysis for modeling and forecasting life-table death counts. Our extension assigns higher weights to more recent data and provides a modeling scheme easily adapted for constraints. We illustrate our method using age-specific Swedish life-table death counts from 1751 to 2020. Compared to their unweighted counterparts, the weighted compositional data analytic method improves short-term point and interval forecast accuracies. The improved forecast accuracy could help actuaries improve the pricing of annuities and setting of reserves.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 10 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |

This paper explores a novel self-supervised approach to re-label time series datasets by inherently constructing candidate datasets. During the optimization of a simple reconstruction network, intermediates are used as pseudo labels in a self-supervised paradigm, improving generalization for any predictor. We introduce the Self-Correction with Adaptive Mask (SCAM), which discards overfitted components and selectively replaces them with pseudo labels generated from reconstructions. Additionally, we incorporate Spectral Norm Regularization (SNR) to further suppress overfitting from a loss landscape perspective. Our experiments on eleven real-world datasets demonstrate that SCAM consistently improves the performance of various backbone models. This work offers a new perspective on constructing datasets and enhancing the generalization of TSF models through self-supervised learning.

However, the existing Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function sometimes fails to accurately capture the seasonality or trend within the forecasting horizon, even when decomposition modules are used in the forward propagation to model the trend and seasonality separately. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective Decomposition-Based Loss function called DBLoss. This method uses exponential moving averages to decompose the time series into seasonal and trend components within the forecasting horizon, and then calculates the loss for each of these components separately, followed by weighting them. As a general loss function, DBLoss can be combined with any deep learning forecasting model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DBLoss significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world datasets and provides a new perspective on the design of time series loss functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

We propose the Diffuse to Detect (DTD) framework, a novel approach that innovatively adapts diffusion models for anomaly detection, diverging from their conventional use in generative tasks with high inference time. By comparison, DTD employs a single-step diffusion process to predict noise patterns, enabling rapid and precise identification of anomalies without reconstruction errors. This approach is grounded in robust theoretical foundations that link noise prediction to the data distribution's score function, ensuring reliable deviation detection. By integrating Graph Neural Networks to model sensor relationships as dynamic graphs, DTD effectively captures spatial (inter-sensor) and temporal anomalies. Its two-branch architecture, with parametric neural network-based energy scoring for scalability and nonparametric statistical methods for interpretability, provides flexible trade-offs between computational efficiency and transparency. Extensive evaluations on UAV sensor data, multivariate time series, and images demonstrate DTD's superior performance over existing methods, underscoring its generality across diverse data modalities. This versatility, combined with its adaptability, positions DTD as a transformative solution for safety-critical applications, including industrial monitoring and beyond.</p></details> |  |

Under the potential outcomes framework, recent research has studied time-series experiments from the design-based perspective, relying solely on the randomness in the design to drive the statistical inference. Focusing on simpler statistical methods, we examine the design-based properties of regression-based methods for estimating treatment effects in time-series experiments. We demonstrate that the treatment effects of interest can be consistently estimated using ordinary least squares with an appropriately specified working model and transformed regressors. Our analysis allows for estimating a diverging number of treatment effects simultaneously, and establishes the consistency and asymptotic normality of the regression-based estimators. Additionally, we show that asymptotically, the heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent variance estimators provide conservative estimates of the true, design-based variances. Importantly, although our approach relies on regression, our design-based framework allows for misspecification of the regression model.</p></details> | 53 pages |

Originally designed for single-treated unit scenarios, it has recently found applications in high-dimensional disaggregated settings with multiple treated units. However, challenges in practical implementation and computational efficiency arise in such scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel approach that integrates the Multivariate Square-root Lasso method into the synthetic control framework. We rigorously establish the estimation error bounds for fitting the Synthetic Control weights using Multivariate Square-root Lasso, accommodating high-dimensionality and time series dependencies. Additionally, we quantify the estimation error for the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT). Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that our method offers superior computational efficiency without compromising estimation accuracy.

We introduce a model-free framework using surprisal (information theoretic uncertainty) to directly analyze and perform inferences from raw data, eliminating distribution modeling, reducing bias, and enabling efficient updates including direct edits and deletion of training data. By quantifying relevance through uncertainty, the approach enables generalizable inference across tasks including generative inference, causal discovery, anomaly detection, and time series forecasting. It emphasizes traceability, interpretability, and data-driven decision making, offering a unified, human-understandable framework for machine learning, and achieves at or near state-of-the-art performance across most common machine learning tasks. The mathematical foundations create a ``physics'' of information, which enable these techniques to apply effectively to a wide variety of complex data types, including missing data. Empirical results indicate that this may be a viable alternative path to neural networks with regard to scalable machine learning and artificial intelligence that can maintain human understandability of the underlying mechanics.</p></details> | 117 pages |
| **[DQS: A Low-Budget Query Strategy for Enhancing Unsupervised Data-driven Anomaly Detection Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05663v3)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Truly unsupervised approaches for time series anomaly detection are rare in the literature. Those that exist suffer from a poorly set threshold, which hampers detection performance, while others, despite claiming to be unsupervised, need to be calibrated using a labelled data subset, which is often not available in the real world. This work integrates active learning with an existing unsupervised anomaly detection method by selectively querying the labels of multivariate time series, which are then used to refine the threshold selection process. To achieve this, we introduce a novel query strategy called the dissimilarity-based query strategy (DQS). DQS aims to maximise the diversity of queried samples by evaluating the similarity between anomaly scores using dynamic time warping. We assess the detection performance of DQS in comparison to other query strategies and explore the impact of mislabelling, a topic that is underexplored in the literature. Our findings indicate that DQS performs best in small-budget scenarios, though the others appear to be more robust when faced with mislabelling. Therefore, in the real world, the choice of query strategy depends on the expertise of the oracle and the number of samples they are willing to label. Regardless, all query strategies outperform the unsupervised threshold even in the presence of mislabelling. Thus, whenever it is feasible to query an oracle, employing an active learning-based threshold is recommended.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Journal of Big Data</p></details> |

However, single model approaches often fail to capture the complex, nonlinear, and multi scale temporal patterns in traffic flow data. This study proposes a decomposition driven hybrid framework that integrates Seasonal Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) with three complementary predictive models. STL first decomposes the original time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components. Then, a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network models long term trends, an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model captures seasonal periodicity, and an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm predicts nonlinear residual fluctuations. The final forecast is obtained through multiplicative integration of the sub model predictions. Using 998 traffic flow records from a New York City intersection between November and December 2015, results show that the LSTM ARIMA XGBoost hybrid model significantly outperforms standalone models including LSTM, ARIMA, and XGBoost across MAE, RMSE, and R squared metrics. The decomposition strategy effectively isolates temporal characteristics, allowing each model to specialize, thereby improving prediction accuracy, interpretability, and robustness.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, the package also allows the construction of measures of risk as well as modeling and designing economic scenarios based on the conditional densities. In particular, the package enables users to: (i) extract global and group-specific factors using a flexible multi-level factor structure; (ii) compute asymptotically valid confidence regions for the estimated factors, accounting for uncertainty in the factor loadings; (iii) obtain estimates of the parameters of the FA-QRs together with their standard deviations; (iv) recover full predictive conditional densities from estimated quantiles; (v) obtain risk measures based on extreme quantiles of the conditional densities; and (vi) estimate the conditional density and the corresponding extreme quantiles when the factors are stressed.</p></details> |  |

However, self-supervised representation learning for spatially characterised time series, which are ubiquitous in transportation domain, poses unique challenges due to the necessity of maintaining fine-grained spatio-temporal similarities in the latent space. In this study, we introduce two structure-preserving regularisers for the contrastive learning of spatial time series: one regulariser preserves the topology of similarities between instances, and the other preserves the graph geometry of similarities across spatial and temporal dimensions. To balance the contrastive learning objective and the need for structure preservation, we propose a dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively manages this trade-off and stabilises training. We validate the proposed method through extensive experiments, including multivariate time series classification to demonstrate its general applicability, as well as macroscopic and microscopic traffic prediction to highlight its particular usefulness in encoding traffic interactions. Across all tasks, our method preserves the similarity structures more effectively and improves state-of-the-art task performances. This method can be integrated with an arbitrary neural network model and is particularly beneficial for time series data with spatial or geographical features. Furthermore, our findings suggest that well-preserved similarity structures in the latent space indicate more informative and useful representations.

Existing approaches, such as the {\em Normalized Difference Built-up Index} (NDBI), often struggle to accurately capture urban development due to factors like atmospheric noise, seasonal variation, and cloud cover. These limitations hinder large-scale monitoring of human development and urbanization. To address these challenges, we propose an approach that leverages {\em Vision-Language Models }(VLMs) to provide a development score for regions. Specifically, we collect a time series of Sentinel-2 images for each region. Then, we further process the images within fixed time windows to get an image with minimal cloud cover, which serves as the representative image for that time window. To ensure consistent scoring, we adopt two strategies: (i) providing the VLM with a curated set of reference images representing different levels of urbanization, and (ii) supplying the most recent past image to both anchor temporal consistency and mitigate cloud-related noise in the current image. Together, these components enable AUI to overcome the challenges of traditional urbanization indices and produce more reliable and stable development scores. Our qualitative experiments on Bangalore suggest that AUI outperforms standard indices such as NDBI.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ab...</summary><p>An abridged version of this paper will be presented at and appear in the Proceedings of ACM IKDD CODS 2025</p></details> |

This synthetic data can be used to supplement historical data to train large trading models. The state-of-the-art models for the generative application often rely on huge amounts of historical data and large, complicated models. These models range from autoregressive and diffusion-based models through to architecturally simpler models such as the temporal-attention bilinear layer. Agent-based approaches to modelling limit order book dynamics can also recreate trading activity through mechanistic models of trader behaviours. In this work, we demonstrate how a popular agent-based framework for simulating intraday trading activity, the Chiarella model, can be combined with one of the most performant deep learning models for forecasting multi-variate time series, the TABL model. This forecasting model is coupled to a simulation of a matching engine with a novel method for simulating deleted order flow. Our simulator gives us the ability to test the generative abilities of the forecasting model using stylised facts. Our results show that this methodology generates realistic price dynamics however, when analysing deeper, parts of the markets microstructure are not accurately recreated, highlighting the necessity for including more sophisticated agent behaviors into the modeling framework to help account for tail events.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, accepted to the Workshop on AI in Finance at ECAI2025</p></details> |
| **[Inference on common trends in functional time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00590v5)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study statistical inference on unit roots and cointegration for time series in a Hilbert space. We develop statistical inference on the number of common stochastic trends embedded in the time series, i.e., the dimension of the nonstationary subspace. We also consider tests of hypotheses on the nonstationary and stationary subspaces themselves. The Hilbert space can be of an arbitrarily large dimension, and our methods remain asymptotically valid even when the time series of interest takes values in a subspace of possibly unknown dimension. This has wide applicability in practice; for example, to cointegrated vector time series that are either high-dimensional or of finite dimension, to high-dimensional factor models that include a finite number of nonstationary factors, to cointegrated curve-valued (or function-valued) time series, and to nonstationary dynamic functional factor models. We include two empirical illustrations to the term structure of interest rates and labor market indices, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Without Augmenting: Unsupervised Time Series Representation Learning via Frame Projections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22655v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning representations without labeled data. Most SSL approaches rely on strong, well-established, handcrafted data augmentations to generate diverse views for representation learning. However, designing such augmentations requires domain-specific knowledge and implicitly imposes representational invariances on the model, which can limit generalization. In this work, we propose an unsupervised representation learning method that replaces augmentations by generating views using orthonormal bases and overcomplete frames. We show that embeddings learned from orthonormal and overcomplete spaces reside on distinct manifolds, shaped by the geometric biases introduced by representing samples in different spaces. By jointly leveraging the complementary geometry of these distinct manifolds, our approach achieves superior performance without artificially increasing data diversity through strong augmentations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on nine datasets across five temporal sequence tasks, where signal-specific characteristics make data augmentations particularly challenging. Without relying on augmentation-induced diversity, our method achieves performance gains of up to 15--20\% over existing self-supervised approaches.

| **[CLEANet: Robust and Efficient Anomaly Detection in Contaminated Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22619v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection is essential for maintaining the reliability of industrial systems, yet real-world deployment is hindered by two critical challenges: training data contamination (noises and hidden anomalies) and inefficient model inference. Existing unsupervised methods assume clean training data, but contamination distorts learned patterns and degrades detection accuracy. Meanwhile, complex deep models often overfit to contamination and suffer from high latency, limiting practical use. To address these challenges, we propose CLEANet, a robust and efficient anomaly detection framework in contaminated multivariate time series. CLEANet introduces a Contamination-Resilient Training Framework (CRTF) that mitigates the impact of corrupted samples through an adaptive reconstruction weighting strategy combined with clustering-guided contrastive learning, thereby enhancing robustness. To further avoid overfitting on contaminated data and improve computational efficiency, we design a lightweight conjugate MLP that disentangles temporal and cross-feature dependencies. Across five public datasets, CLEANet achieves up to 73.04% higher F1 and 81.28% lower runtime compared with ten state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, integrating CRTF into three advanced models yields an average 5.35% F1 gain, confirming its strong generalizability.</p></details> |  |

Initially, we explore a comprehensive approach involving generic nonlinear time delay embedding for time series data extracted from a financial or economic system under examination. Subsequently, we employ sparse least-squares and structured matrix approximation methods to discern approximate representations of the output coupling matrices. These representations play a pivotal role in establishing the regressive models corresponding to the recursive structures inherent in a given financial system. The document further introduces prototypical algorithms that leverage the aforementioned techniques. These algorithms are demonstrated through applications in approximate identification and predictive simulation of dynamic financial and economic processes, encompassing scenarios that may or may not exhibit chaotic behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The content of this publication represents the opinion of the researchers affiliated with the Department of Statistics and Research, but not the official opinion of the CNBS</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Fusion and Interpretability in Human Activity Recognition: A Reproducible Framework for Sensor-Based Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22410v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The research presents a comprehensive framework for consolidating multimodal sensor data collected under naturalistic conditions, grounded in the Carnegie Mellon University Multi-Modal Activity Database (CMU-MMAC). Focusing on Subject 07-Brownie, the study investigates the entire processing pipeline, from data alignment and transformation to fusion method evaluation, interpretability, and modality contribution. A unified preprocessing pipeline is developed to temporally align heterogeneous video and audio data. Fusion is performed through resampling, grayscale conversion, segmentation, and feature standardization. Semantic richness is confirmed via heatmaps, spectrograms, and luminance time series, while frame-aligned waveform overlays demonstrate temporal consistency. Results indicate that late fusion yields the highest validation accuracy, followed by hybrid fusion, with early fusion performing the lowest. To assess the interpretability and discriminative power of audio and video in fused activity recognition, PCA and t-SNE visualize feature coherence over time. Classification results show limited performance for audio alone, moderate for video, and significant improvement with multimodal fusion, underscoring the strengths of combined data. Incorporating RFID data, which captures sparse interactions asynchronously, further enhances recognition accuracy by over 50% and improves macro-averaged ROC-AUC. The framework demonstrates the potential to transform raw, asynchronous sensor data into aligned, semantically meaningful representations, providing a reproducible approach for multimodal data integration and interpretation in intelligent systems designed to perceive complex human activities.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[NetBurst: Event-Centric Forecasting of Bursty, Intermittent Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22397v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting on widely used benchmark time series data (e.g., ETT, Electricity, Taxi, and Exchange Rate, etc.) has favored smooth, seasonal series, but network telemetry time series -- traffic measurements at service, IP, or subnet granularity -- are instead highly bursty and intermittent, with heavy-tailed bursts and highly variable inactive periods. These properties place the latter in the statistical regimes made famous and popularized more than 20 years ago by B.~Mandelbrot. Yet forecasting such time series with modern-day AI architectures remains underexplored. We introduce NetBurst, an event-centric framework that reformulates forecasting as predicting when bursts occur and how large they are, using quantile-based codebooks and dual autoregressors. Across large-scale sets of production network telemetry time series and compared to strong baselines, such as Chronos, NetBurst reduces Mean Average Scaled Error (MASE) by 13--605x on service-level time series while preserving burstiness and producing embeddings that cluster 5x more cleanly than Chronos. In effect, our work highlights the benefits that modern AI can reap from leveraging Mandelbrot's pioneering studies for forecasting in bursty, intermittent, and heavy-tailed regimes, where its operational value for high-stakes decision making is of paramount interest.</p></details> |  |
| **[Monitoring State Transitions in Markovian Systems with Sampling Cost](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22327v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a node-monitor pair, where the node's state varies with time. The monitor needs to track the node's state at all times; however, there is a fixed cost for each state query. So the monitor may instead predict the state using time-series forecasting methods, including time-series foundation models (TSFMs), and query only when prediction uncertainty is high. Since query decisions influence prediction accuracy, determining when to query is nontrivial. A natural approach is a greedy policy that predicts when the expected prediction loss is below the query cost and queries otherwise. We analyze this policy in a Markovian setting, where the optimal (OPT) strategy is a state-dependent threshold policy minimizing the time-averaged sum of query cost and prediction losses. We show that, in general, the greedy policy is suboptimal and can have an unbounded competitive ratio, but under common conditions such as identically distributed transition probabilities, it performs close to OPT. For the case of unknown transition probabilities, we further propose a projected stochastic gradient descent (PSGD)-based learning variant of the greedy policy, which achieves a favorable predict-query tradeoff with improved computational efficiency compared to OPT.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[TimeXL: Explainable Multi-modal Time Series Prediction with LLM-in-the-Loop](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01013v3)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis provides essential insights for real-world system dynamics and informs downstream decision-making, yet most existing methods often overlook the rich contextual signals present in auxiliary modalities. To bridge this gap, we introduce TimeXL, a multi-modal prediction framework that integrates a prototype-based time series encoder with three collaborating Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver more accurate predictions and interpretable explanations. First, a multi-modal prototype-based encoder processes both time series and textual inputs to generate preliminary forecasts alongside case-based rationales. These outputs then feed into a prediction LLM, which refines the forecasts by reasoning over the encoder's predictions and explanations. Next, a reflection LLM compares the predicted values against the ground truth, identifying textual inconsistencies or noise. Guided by this feedback, a refinement LLM iteratively enhances text quality and triggers encoder retraining. This closed-loop workflow-prediction, critique (reflect), and refinement-continuously boosts the framework's performance and interpretability. Empirical evaluations on four real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeXL achieves up to 8.9% improvement in AUC and produces human-centric, multi-modal explanations, highlighting the power of LLM-driven reasoning for time series prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Lightweight Gradient-based Causal Discovery Framework with Applications to Complex Industrial Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11178v2)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancement of deep learning technologies, various neural network-based Granger causality models have been proposed. Although these models have demonstrated notable improvements, several limitations remain. Most existing approaches adopt the component-wise architecture, necessitating the construction of a separate model for each time series, which results in substantial computational costs. In addition, imposing the sparsity-inducing penalty on the first-layer weights of the neural network to extract causal relationships weakens the model's ability to capture complex interactions. To address these limitations, we propose Gradient Regularization-based Neural Granger Causality (GRNGC), which requires only one time series prediction model and applies $L_{1}$ regularization to the gradient between model's input and output to infer Granger causality. Moreover, GRNGC is not tied to a specific time series forecasting model and can be implemented with diverse architectures such as KAN, MLP, and LSTM, offering enhanced flexibility. Numerical simulations on DREAM, Lorenz-96, fMRI BOLD, and CausalTime show that GRNGC outperforms existing baselines and significantly reduces computational overhead. Meanwhile, experiments on real-world DNA, Yeast, HeLa, and bladder urothelial carcinoma datasets further validate the model's effectiveness in reconstructing gene regulatory networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,3 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[Learning Satellite Pattern-of-Life Identification: A Diffusion-based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10814v3)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Earth's orbital satellite population grows exponentially, effective space situational awareness becomes critical for collision prevention and sustainable operations. Current approaches to monitor satellite behaviors rely on expert knowledge and rule-based systems that scale poorly. Among essential monitoring tasks, satellite pattern-of-life (PoL) identification, analyzing behaviors like station-keeping maneuvers and drift operations, remains underdeveloped due to aerospace system complexity, operational variability, and inconsistent ephemerides sources. We propose a novel generative approach for satellite PoL identification that significantly eliminates the dependence on expert knowledge. The proposed approach leverages orbital elements and positional data to enable automatic pattern discovery directly from observations. Our implementation uses a diffusion model framework for end-to-end identification without manual refinement or domain expertise. The architecture combines a multivariate time-series encoder to capture hidden representations of satellite positional data with a conditional denoising process to generate accurate PoL classifications. Through experiments across diverse real-world satellite operational scenarios, our approach demonstrates superior identification quality and robustness across varying data quality characteristics. A case study using actual satellite data confirms the approach's transformative potential for operational behavior pattern identification, enhanced tracking, and space situational awareness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dopamine-driven synaptic credit assignment in neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22178v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving the synaptic Credit Assignment Problem(CAP) is central to learning in both biological and artificial neural systems. Finding an optimal solution for synaptic CAP means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or animals. Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural networks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For instance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations. This leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and memory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To address these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration from neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for training neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight Perturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards optima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction Error (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the actual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the learning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate strategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine optimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming significantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art Machine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible.</p></details> |  |

Although numerous time series classification methods have identified key subsequences, known as shapelets, as core features for achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating their pivotal role in classification outcomes, existing post-hoc time series explanation (PHTSE) methods primarily focus on timestep-level feature attribution. These explanation methods overlook the fundamental prior that classification outcomes are predominantly driven by key shapelets. To bridge this gap, we present ShapeX, an innovative framework that segments time series into meaningful shapelet-driven segments and employs Shapley values to assess their saliency. At the core of ShapeX lies the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework, which effectively learns a diverse set of shapelets essential for classification. We further demonstrate that ShapeX produces explanations which reveal causal relationships instead of just correlations, owing to the atomicity properties of shapelets. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that ShapeX outperforms existing methods in identifying the most relevant subsequences, enhancing both the precision and causal fidelity of time series explanations.</p></details> |  |

| **[Retrieval Augmented Generation-Enhanced Distributed LLM Agents for Generalizable Traffic Signal Control with Emergency Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26242v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3 adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17 to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[DARTS: A Drone-Based AI-Powered Real-Time Traffic Incident Detection System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26004v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid and reliable incident detection is critical for reducing crash-related fatalities, injuries, and congestion. However, conventional methods, such as closed-circuit television, dashcam footage, and sensor-based detection, separate detection from verification, suffer from limited flexibility, and require dense infrastructure or high penetration rates, restricting adaptability and scalability to shifting incident hotspots. To overcome these challenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic incident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial perspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better low-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep learning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident detection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected dataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity assessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a web-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS detected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local transportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion propagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and enable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk. Crucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on frequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and cost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings. This study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated real-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for the operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation management.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version.

| **[Adversarial Pre-Padding: Generating Evasive Network Traffic Against Transformer-Based Classifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25810v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To date, traffic obfuscation techniques have been widely adopted to protect network data privacy and security by obscuring the true patterns of traffic. Nevertheless, as the pre-trained models emerge, especially transformer-based classifiers, existing traffic obfuscation methods become increasingly vulnerable, as witnessed by current studies reporting the traffic classification accuracy up to 99\% or higher. To counter such high-performance transformer-based classification models, we in this paper propose a novel and effective \underline{adv}ersarial \underline{traffic}-generating approach (AdvTraffic\footnote{The code and data are available at: http://xxx}). Our approach has two key innovations: (i) a pre-padding strategy is proposed to modify packets, which effectively overcomes the limitations of existing research against transformer-based models for network traffic classification; and (ii) a reinforcement learning model is employed to optimize network traffic perturbations, aiming to maximize adversarial effectiveness against transformer-based classification models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply adversarial perturbation techniques to defend against transformer-based traffic classifiers. Furthermore, our method can be easily deployed into practical network environments. Finally, multi-faceted experiments are conducted across several real-world datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively undermine transformer-based classifiers, significantly reducing classification accuracy from 99\% to as low as 25.68\%.</p></details> |  |

Traffic was captured using Wireshark, and key metrics (including delay, jitter, bandwidth, and packet loss) were analyzed. Google Drive maintained the most consistent performance across both types of networks, showing low latency and reduced jitter. Dropbox showed efficient bandwidth utilization, but experienced a longer delay over LTE, attributed to a greater number of intermediate hops. OneDrive presented variable behavior, with elevated packet rates and increased sensitivity to fluctuations in the mobile network. A bimodal distribution of packet sizes was observed and modeled using a dual Poisson function. In general, Wi-Fi connections provided greater stability for multimedia transfers, while LTE performance varied depending on platform-specific implementations. The results contribute to a better understanding of traffic behavior in cloud-based storage applications and suggest further analysis with larger datasets and heterogeneous access networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 20th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies (CISTI), Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems</p></details> |

The dataset provides a unique view into global threat activity as observed through scanning and backscatter traffic, key indicators of large-scale probing behavior, data outages, and ongoing denial-of-service (DoS) campaigns. To process this extensive archive, coarse-to-fine methodology is adopted in which general insights are first extracted through a resource-efficient metadata sub-pipeline, followed by a more detailed packet header sub-pipeline for finer-grained analysis. The methodology establishes two sub-pipelines to enable scalable processing of nearly two decades of telescope data and supports multi-level exploration of traffic dynamics. Initial insights highlight long-term trends and recurring traffic spikes, some attributable to Internet-wide scanning events and others likely linked to DoS activities.We present general observations spanning 2006-2024, with a focused analysis of traffic characteristics during 2024.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue a comprehensive methodology is designed to optimize traffic flow and minimize delays. The framework is structured with three primary components: (a) vehicle detection, (b) traffic prediction, and (c) traffic signal optimization. This paper presents the first component, vehicle detection. The methodology involves analyzing multiple sequential frames from a camera feed to compute the background, i.e. the underlying roadway, by averaging pixel values over time. The computed background is then utilized to extract the foreground, where the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is applied to detect vehicles. With its computational efficiency and minimal infrastructure modification requirements, the proposed methodology offers a practical and scalable solution for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing the Completeness of Traffic Scenario Categories for Automated Highway Driving Functions via Cluster-based Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02599v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to operate safely in increasingly complex traffic scenarios is a fundamental requirement for Automated Driving Systems (ADS). Ensuring the safe release of ADS functions necessitates a precise understanding of the occurring traffic scenarios. To support this objective, this work introduces a pipeline for traffic scenario clustering and the analysis of scenario category completeness. The Clustering Vector Quantized - Variational Autoencoder (CVQ-VAE) is employed for the clustering of highway traffic scenarios and utilized to create various catalogs with differing numbers of traffic scenario categories. Subsequently, the impact of the number of categories on the completeness considerations of the traffic scenario categories is analyzed. The results show an outperforming clustering performance compared to previous work. The trade-off between cluster quality and the amount of required data to maintain completeness is discussed based on the publicly available highD dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[DQ3D: Depth-guided Query for Transformer-Based 3D Object Detection in Traffic Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23144v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D object detection from multi-view images in traffic scenarios has garnered significant attention in recent years. Many existing approaches rely on object queries that are generated from 3D reference points to localize objects. However, a limitation of these methods is that some reference points are often far from the target object, which can lead to false positive detections. In this paper, we propose a depth-guided query generator for 3D object detection (DQ3D) that leverages depth information and 2D detections to ensure that reference points are sampled from the surface or interior of the object. Furthermore, to address partially occluded objects in current frame, we introduce a hybrid attention mechanism that fuses historical detection results with depth-guided queries, thereby forming hybrid queries. Evaluation on the nuScenes dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms the baseline by 6.3\% in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) and 4.3\% in the NuScenes Detection Score (NDS).</p></details> |  |
| **[Traffic flow forecasting, STL decomposition, Hybrid model, LSTM, ARIMA, XGBoost, Intelligent transportation systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23668v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate traffic flow forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation systems and urban traffic management. However, single model approaches often fail to capture the complex, nonlinear, and multi scale temporal patterns in traffic flow data. This study proposes a decomposition driven hybrid framework that integrates Seasonal Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) with three complementary predictive models. STL first decomposes the original time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components. Then, a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network models long term trends, an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model captures seasonal periodicity, and an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm predicts nonlinear residual fluctuations. The final forecast is obtained through multiplicative integration of the sub model predictions. Using 998 traffic flow records from a New York City intersection between November and December 2015, results show that the LSTM ARIMA XGBoost hybrid model significantly outperforms standalone models including LSTM, ARIMA, and XGBoost across MAE, RMSE, and R squared metrics. The decomposition strategy effectively isolates temporal characteristics, allowing each model to specialize, thereby improving prediction accuracy, interpretability, and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Error Adjustment Based on Spatiotemporal Correlation Fusion for Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23656v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) play a significant role in an increasing body of research on traffic forecasting due to their effectively capturing spatiotemporal patterns embedded in traffic data. A general assumption of training the said forecasting models via mean squared error estimation is that the errors across time steps and spatial positions are uncorrelated. However, this assumption does not really hold because of the autocorrelation caused by both the temporality and spatiality of traffic data. This gap limits the performance of DNN-based forecasting models and is overlooked by current studies. To fill up this gap, this paper proposes Spatiotemporally Autocorrelated Error Adjustment (SAEA), a novel and general framework designed to systematically adjust autocorrelated prediction errors in traffic forecasting. Unlike existing approaches that assume prediction errors follow a random Gaussian noise distribution, SAEA models these errors as a spatiotemporal vector autoregressive (VAR) process to capture their intrinsic dependencies. First, it explicitly captures both spatial and temporal error correlations by a coefficient matrix, which is then embedded into a newly formulated cost function. Second, a structurally sparse regularization is introduced to incorporate prior spatial information, ensuring that the learned coefficient matrix aligns with the inherent road network structure. Finally, an inference process with test-time error adjustment is designed to dynamically refine predictions, mitigating the impact of autocorrelated errors in real-time forecasting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified on different traffic datasets. Results across a wide range of traffic forecasting models show that our method enhances performance in almost all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

With the aim of overcoming such limitations, network operators are foreseeing Digital Twins (DTs) as key enablers, which are designed as dynamic and virtual replicas of network infrastructure, allowing operators to model, analyze, and optimize various operations without any risk of affecting the live network. However, for Digital Twin Networks (DTNs) to meet the challenges faced by operators especially in line with resource management, a driving engine is needed. In this paper, an AI (Artificial Intelligence)-driven approach is presented by integrating a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network into the DT framework, aimed at forecasting network traffic patterns and proactively managing resource allocation. Through analytical experiments, the AI-Enabled DT framework demonstrates superior performance benchmarked against baseline methods. Our study concludes that embedding AI capabilities within DTs paves the way for fully autonomous, adaptive, and high-performance network management in future mobile networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 fig...</summary><p>6 figures, 2 Tables, Accepted at IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM) 2025</p></details> |

This approach typically uses a computing cluster managed by a container orchestration platform to deploy microservices. However, this shift introduces significant challenges, particularly in the efficient scheduling of containerized services. These challenges are compounded by unpredictable scenarios such as dynamic incoming workloads with various execution traffic and variable communication delays among cluster nodes. Existing works often overlook the real-time traffic impacts of dynamic requests on running microservices, as well as the varied communication delays across cluster nodes. Consequently, even optimally deployed microservices could suffer from significant performance degradation over time. To address these issues, we propose a network and traffic-aware adaptive scheduling framework, TraDE, which can adaptively redeploy microservice instances to maintain desired performance amid changing traffic and network conditions within the hosting cluster. We have implemented TraDE as an extension to the Kubernetes platform. Additionally, we deployed realistic microservice applications in a real compute cluster and conducted extensive experiments to assess our framework's performance in various scenarios. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of TraDE in rescheduling running microservices to enhance end-to-end performance while maintaining a high goodput ratio. Compared with the existing method NetMARKS, TraDE outperforms it by reducing the average response time of the application by up to 48.3%, and improving the throughput by up to 1.2-1.5x across workloads while maintaining a goodput ratio of 95.36%, and showing robust adaptive capability to meet QoS targets under sustained workloads and dynamic networking conditions.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[A Traffic Prediction-Based Individualized Driver Warning System to Reduce Red Light Violations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03271v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Red light violation is a major cause of traffic collisions and resulting injuries and fatalities. Despite extensive prior work to reduce red light violations, they continue to be a major problem in practice, partly because existing systems suffer from the flaw of providing the same guidance to all drivers. As a result, some violations are avoided, but other drivers ignore or respond inappropriately to red light running systems, resulting in safety issues overall. We show a method of providing accurate warnings to individual drivers to avoid the broad guidance approach of most existing systems. Recognizing if a driver will run red lights is highly dependent on signal phase and timing, traffic conditions along the road, and individual driver behaviour, the proposed warning system contains three parts: a traffic prediction algorithm, an individual warning signal optimizer, and a driver warning display. The traffic prediction algorithm predicts future traffic states along the road towards the signalized intersections using the latest traffic conditions obtained through vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. Then, an optimization problem is formulated to compute the optimal warning signal based on predicted traffic states and driver reaction model. Finally, the optimal warning signal is shown on the display screen to advise driver on how much braking is needed to avoid running the red light. The system continuously updates the latest warning signal as the vehicle is approaching the intersection. Both numerical simulated driving scenarios and real-world road tests are used to demonstrate the proposed algorithm's performance under different conditions by comparing with previous work on red light running warning system. The results show that the system provides more effective and accurate warning signals to drivers, helping them avoid running red lights.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ASCE's Journal of Transportation Engineering, Part A: Systems</p></details> |

However, the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution inherent in fisheye imagery introduce substantial challenges for standard object detectors, particularly near image boundaries where object appearance is severely degraded. In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate robustly under these conditions. Our approach employs a simple yet effective pre and post processing pipeline that enhances detection consistency across the image, especially in regions affected by severe distortion. We train several state-of-the-art detection models on the fisheye traffic imagery and combine their outputs through an ensemble strategy to improve overall detection accuracy. Our method achieves an F1 score of0.6366 on the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 4, placing 8thoverall out of 62 teams.

These methods become computationally prohibitive for large-scale networks due to non-linear growth in complexity with the number of OD pairs. This study introduces a novel data-driven approach using deep neural networks, specifically leveraging the Transformer architecture, to predict equilibrium path flows directly. By focusing on path-level traffic distribution, the proposed model captures intricate correlations between OD pairs, offering a more detailed and flexible analysis compared to traditional link-level approaches. The Transformer-based model drastically reduces computation time, while adapting to changes in demand and network structure without the need for recalculation. Numerical experiments are conducted on the Manhattan-like synthetic network, the Sioux Falls network, and the Eastern-Massachusetts network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is orders of magnitude faster than conventional optimization. It efficiently estimates path-level traffic flows in multi-class networks, reducing computational costs and improving prediction accuracy by capturing detailed trip and flow information. The model also adapts flexibly to varying demand and network conditions, supporting traffic management and enabling rapid `what-if' analyses for enhanced transportation planning and policy-making.</p></details> |  |

Compared with traditional reinforcement learning and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers three main advantages: zero-shot generalization, transferring unchanged to new road networks and out-of-distribution incidents by leveraging internal traffic-control policies and reasoning; a compact 3B-parameter design that supports real-time inference on mobile-class chips for edge deployment; and an explainable TSC process that enables multi-intersection coordination through communication and an asynchronous communication network. Extensive benchmarks show Traffic-R1 outperforms strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In production, the model now manages signals affecting over 55,000 drivers daily, reduces average queue lengths by more than 5%, and halves operator workload.

However, IoT networks remain vulnerable to security threats such as denial of service (DoS) attacks, anomalous traffic, and data manipulation due to decentralized architectures and limited resources. To address these issues, this paper proposes an advanced anomaly detection framework with three main phases. First, data preprocessing is performed using the Median KS Test to remove noise, handle missing values, and balance datasets for cleaner input. Second, a feature selection phase employs a Genetic Algorithm combined with eagle inspired search strategies to identify the most relevant features, reduce dimensionality, and improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, an ensemble classifier integrates Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms to achieve accurate and reliable anomaly detection. The proposed model demonstrates high adaptability and scalability across diverse IoT environments. Experimental results show that it outperforms existing methods by achieving 98 percent accuracy, 95 percent detection rate, and reductions in false positive (10 percent) and false negative (5 percent) rates. These results confirm the framework effectiveness and robustness in improving IoT network security against evolving cyber threats.</p></details> | 24 pages |

However, automatic traffic detectors across national road networks often provide incomplete coverage, leading to underrepresentation of minor roads. While recent machine learning advances have improved AADT estimation at unmeasured locations, most models produce only point predictions and overlook estimation uncertainty. This study addresses that gap by introducing an interval prediction approach that explicitly quantifies predictive uncertainty. We integrate a Quantile Random Forest model with Principal Component Analysis to generate AADT prediction intervals, providing plausible traffic ranges bounded by estimated minima and maxima. Using data from over 2,000 minor roads in England and Wales, and evaluated with specialized interval metrics, the proposed method achieves an interval coverage probability of 88.22%, a normalized average width of 0.23, and a Winkler Score of 7,468.47. By combining machine learning with spatial and high-dimensional analysis, this framework enhances both the accuracy and interpretability of AADT estimation, supporting more robust and informed transport planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing 5G V2X Mode 2 for Sporadic Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17395v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emerging road safety and autonomous vehicle applications require timely and reliable data delivery between vehicles and between vehicles and infrastructure. To satisfy this demand, 3GPP develops a 5G Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology. Depending on the served traffic type, 5G V2X specifications propose two channel access methods: (i) Mode 1, according to which a base station allocates resources to users, and (ii) Mode 2, according to which users autonomously select resources for their transmissions. In the paper, we consider a scenario with sporadic traffic, e.g., a vehicle generates a packet at a random time moment when it detects a dangerous situation, which imposes strict requirements on delay and reliability. To satisfy strict delay requirements, vehicles use Mode 2. We analyze the performance of Mode 2 for sporadic traffic and propose several approaches to improve it. Simulation results show that the proposed approaches can increase the system capacity by up to 40% with a low impact on complexity.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose FlowDet, a high-speed detector featuring a decoupled encoder optimization strategy applied to the DETR architecture. Specifically, FlowDet employs a novel Geometric Deformable Unit (GDU) for traffic-aware geometric modeling and a Scale-Aware Attention (SAA) module to maintain high representational power across extreme scale variations. To rigorously evaluate the model's performance in environments with severe occlusion and high object density, we collected the Intersection-Flow-5k dataset, a new challenging scene for this task. Evaluated on Intersection-Flow-5k, FlowDet establishes a new state-of-the-art. Compared to the strong RT-DETR baseline, it improves AP(test) by 1.5% and AP50(test) by 1.6%, while simultaneously reducing GFLOPs by 63.2% and increasing inference speed by 16.2%. Our work demonstrates a new path towards building highly efficient and accurate detectors for demanding, real-world perception systems.

Since each node in such environments generates various types of data with diverse service requirements, MAC protocol holds crucial importance to ensure efficient delivery. In this context, simple to complex MAC schemes are found in literature. This paper focuses on evaluating the performance of two major techniques "slot stealing" and "packet fragmentation" for the IIoT; representative protocols SS-MAC and FROG-MAC have been chosen from each category respectively. We conducted realistic simulations for the two protocols using Contiki. Delay and packet loss comparison for SS-MAC and FROG-MAC indicates the superiority of FROG-MAC due to reduction in the waiting time for urgent traffic. Thus, a simple fragmentation scheme could be deployed for efficient scheduling of heterogenous traffic in the industrial environments.</p></details> |  |

Traditional fixed-time signal control systems often lack the adaptability to manage dynamic traffic patterns effectively. This study explores the application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to optimize traffic signal coordination across multiple intersections within a simulated environment. Utilizing Pygame, a simulation was developed to model a network of interconnected intersections with randomly generated vehicle flows to reflect realistic traffic variability. A decentralized MARL controller was implemented, in which each traffic signal operates as an autonomous agent, making decisions based on local observations and information from neighboring agents. Performance was evaluated against a baseline fixed-time controller using metrics such as average vehicle wait time and overall throughput. The MARL approach demonstrated statistically significant improvements, including reduced average waiting times and improved throughput. These findings suggest that MARL-based dynamic control strategies hold substantial promise for improving urban traffic management efficiency. More research is recommended to address scalability and real-world implementation challenges.</p></details> |  |

Traffic signaling is a key component in effective traffic management for such situations, but the advancements in intelligent traffic signaling have been exclusive to developed countries with structured traffic. The non-lane-based, heterogeneous traffic of Dhaka City requires a contextual approach. This study focuses on the development of an intelligent traffic signaling system feasible in the context of developing countries such as Bangladesh. We propose a pipeline leveraging Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) feeds, a low resources system Raspberry Pi 4B processing, and a state of the art YOLO-based object detection model trained on the Non-lane-based and Heterogeneous Traffic (NHT-1071) dataset to detect and classify heterogeneous traffic. A multi-objective optimization algorithm, NSGA-II, then generates optimized signal timings, minimizing waiting time while maximizing vehicle throughput. We test our implementation in a five-road intersection at Palashi, Dhaka, demonstrating the potential to significantly improve traffic management in similar situations. The developed testbed paves the way for more contextual and effective Intelligent Traffic Signaling (ITS) solutions for developing areas with complicated traffic dynamics such as Dhaka City.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS)</p></details> |

The key to building a logically centralized but physically distributed control-plane is running diverse cluster management protocols to achieve consistency through an exchange of control traffic. Meanwhile, we observe that the control traffic exposes unique time-series patterns and directional relationships due to the operational structure even though the traffic is encrypted, and this pattern can disclose confidential information such as control-plane topology and protocol dependencies, which can be exploited for severe attacks. With this insight, we propose a new SD-WAN fingerprinting system, called Heimdallr. It analyzes periodical and operational patterns of SD-WAN cluster management protocols and the context of flow directions from the collected control traffic utilizing a deep learning-based approach, so that it can classify the cluster management protocols automatically from miscellaneous control traffic datasets. Our evaluation, which is performed in a realistic SD-WAN environment consisting of geographically distant three campus networks and one enterprise network shows that Heimdallr can classify SD-WAN control traffic with $\geq$ 93%, identify individual protocols with $\geq$ 80% macro F-1 scores, and finally can infer control-plane topology with $\geq$ 70% similarity.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Hypergame-based Cognition Modeling and Intention Interpretation for Human-Driven Vehicles in Connected Mixed Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15573v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the practical implementation of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), the traffic system is expected to remain a mix of CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs) for the foreseeable future. To enhance safety and traffic efficiency, the trajectory planning strategies of CAVs must account for the influence of HVs, necessitating accurate HV trajectory prediction. Current research often assumes that human drivers have perfect knowledge of all vehicles' objectives, an unrealistic premise. This paper bridges the gap by leveraging hypergame theory to account for cognitive and perception limitations in HVs. We model human bounded rationality without assuming them to be merely passive followers and propose a hierarchical cognition modeling framework that captures cognitive relationships among vehicles. We further analyze the cognitive stability of the system, proving that the strategy profile where all vehicles adopt cognitively equilibrium strategies constitutes a hyper Nash equilibrium when CAVs accurately learn HV parameters. To achieve this, we develop an inverse learning algorithm for distributed intention interpretation via vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, which extends the framework to both offline and online scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a distributed trajectory prediction and planning approach for CAVs, leveraging the learned parameters in real time. Simulations in highway lane-changing scenarios demonstrate the proposed method's accuracy in parameter learning, robustness to noisy trajectory observations, and safety in HV trajectory prediction. The results validate the effectiveness of our method in both offline and online implementations.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods - ranging from rule-based heuristics to reinforcement learning (RL) - often struggle to generalize to complex, dynamic, and safety-critical scenarios. We introduce VLMLight, a novel TSC framework that integrates vision-language meta-control with dual-branch reasoning. At the core of VLMLight is the first image-based traffic simulator that enables multi-view visual perception at intersections, allowing policies to reason over rich cues such as vehicle type, motion, and spatial density. A large language model (LLM) serves as a safety-prioritized meta-controller, selecting between a fast RL policy for routine traffic and a structured reasoning branch for critical cases. In the latter, multiple LLM agents collaborate to assess traffic phases, prioritize emergency vehicles, and verify rule compliance. Experiments show that VLMLight reduces waiting times for emergency vehicles by up to 65% over RL-only systems, while preserving real-time performance in standard conditions with less than 1% degradation. VLMLight offers a scalable, interpretable, and safety-aware solution for next-generation traffic signal control.</p></details> | 25 pages, 15 figures |

Despite substantial progress in imputation models, model selection and development for practical applications remains challenging due to three key gaps: 1) the absence of a model taxonomy for traffic data imputation to trace the technological development and highlight their distinct features. 2) the lack of unified benchmarking pipeline for fair and reproducible model evaluation across standardized traffic datasets. 3) insufficient in-depth analysis that jointly compare models across multiple dimensions, including effectiveness, computational efficiency and robustness. To this end, this paper proposes practice-oriented taxonomies for traffic data missing patterns and imputation models, systematically cataloging real-world traffic data loss scenarios and analyzing the characteristics of existing models. We further introduce a unified benchmarking pipeline to comprehensively evaluate 11 representative models across various missing patterns and rates, assessing overall performance, performance under challenging scenarios, computational efficiency, and providing visualizations. This work aims to provide a holistic perspective on traffic data imputation and to serve as a practical guideline for model selection and application in intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Intention-driven Lane Change Framework Considering Heterogeneous Dynamic Cooperation in Mixed-traffic Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22550v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In mixed-traffic environments, where autonomous vehicles (AVs) interact with diverse human-driven vehicles (HVs), unpredictable intentions and heterogeneous behaviors make safe and efficient lane change maneuvers highly challenging. Existing methods often oversimplify these interactions by assuming uniform patterns. We propose an intention-driven lane change framework that integrates driving-style recognition, cooperation-aware decision-making, and coordinated motion planning. A deep learning classifier trained on the NGSIM dataset identifies human driving styles in real time. A cooperation score with intrinsic and interactive components estimates surrounding drivers' intentions and quantifies their willingness to cooperate with the ego vehicle. Decision-making combines behavior cloning with inverse reinforcement learning to determine whether a lane change should be initiated. For trajectory generation, model predictive control is integrated with IRL-based intention inference to produce collision-free and socially compliant maneuvers. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves 94.2\% accuracy and 94.3\% F1-score, outperforming rule-based and learning-based baselines by 4-15\% in lane change recognition. These results highlight the benefit of modeling inter-driver heterogeneity and demonstrate the potential of the framework to advance context-aware and human-like autonomous driving in complex traffic environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[HOB: A Holistically Optimized Bidding Strategy under Heterogeneous Auction Mechanisms with Organic Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15238v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The E-commerce advertising platforms typically sell commercial traffic through either second-price auction (SPA) or first-price auction (FPA). SPA was historically prevalent due to its dominant strategy incentive-compatible (DSIC) for bidders with quasi-linear utilities, especially when budgets are not a binding constraint, while FPA has gained more prominence for offering higher revenue potential to publishers and avoiding the possibility for discriminatory treatment in personalized reserve prices. Meanwhile, on the demand side, advertisers are increasingly adopting platform-wide marketing solutions akin to QuanZhanTui, shifting from spending budgets solely on commercial traffic to bidding on the entire traffic for the purpose of maximizing overall sales. For automated bidding systems, such a trend poses a critical challenge: determining optimal strategies across heterogeneous auction channels to fulfill diverse advertiser objectives, such as maximizing return (MaxReturn) or meeting target return on ad spend (TargetROAS). To overcome this challenge, this work makes two key contributions. First, we derive an efficient solution for optimal bidding under FPA channels, which takes into account the presence of organic traffic - traffic can be won for free. Second, we introduce a marginal cost alignment (MCA) strategy that provably secures bidding efficiency across heterogeneous auction mechanisms. To validate performance of our developed framework, we conduct comprehensive offline experiments on public datasets and large-scale online A/B testing, which demonstrate consistent improvements over existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatiotemporal Traffic Prediction in Distributed Backend Systems via Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15215v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of traffic prediction in distributed backend systems and proposes a graph neural network based modeling approach to overcome the limitations of traditional models in capturing complex dependencies and dynamic features. The system is abstracted as a graph with nodes and edges, where node features represent traffic and resource states, and adjacency relations describe service interactions. A graph convolution mechanism enables multi order propagation and aggregation of node features, while a gated recurrent structure models historical sequences dynamically, thus integrating spatial structures with temporal evolution. A spatiotemporal joint modeling module further fuses graph representation with temporal dependency, and a decoder generates future traffic predictions. The model is trained with mean squared error to minimize deviations from actual values. Experiments based on public distributed system logs construct combined inputs of node features, topology, and sequences, and compare the proposed method with mainstream baselines using MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. Results show that the proposed method achieves stable performance and low error across different prediction horizons and model depths, significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of traffic forecasting in distributed backend systems and verifying the potential of graph neural networks in complex system modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[FUSE-Traffic: Fusion of Unstructured and Structured Data for Event-aware Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16053v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate traffic forecasting is a core technology for building Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), enabling better urban resource allocation and improved travel experiences. With growing urbanization, traffic congestion has intensified, highlighting the need for reliable and responsive forecasting models. In recent years, deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), has emerged as the mainstream paradigm in traffic forecasting. GNNs can effectively capture complex spatial dependencies in road network topology and dynamic temporal evolution patterns in traffic flow data. Foundational models such as STGCN and GraphWaveNet, along with more recent developments including STWave and D2STGNN, have achieved impressive performance on standard traffic datasets. These approaches incorporate sophisticated graph convolutional structures and temporal modeling mechanisms, demonstrating particular effectiveness in capturing and forecasting traffic patterns characterized by periodic regularities. To address this challenge, researchers have explored various ways to incorporate event information. Early attempts primarily relied on manually engineered event features. For instance, some approaches introduced manually defined incident effect scores or constructed specific subgraphs for different event-induced traffic conditions. While these methods somewhat enhance responsiveness to specific events, their core drawback lies in a heavy reliance on domain experts' prior knowledge, making generalization to diverse and complex unknown events difficult, and low-dimensional manual features often lead to the loss of rich semantic details.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hard-Label Black-Box Evasion Attack against ML-based Malicious Traffic Detection Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14906v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Learning (ML)-based malicious traffic detection is a promising security paradigm. It outperforms rule-based traditional detection by identifying various advanced attacks. However, the robustness of these ML models is largely unexplored, thereby allowing attackers to craft adversarial traffic examples that evade detection. Existing evasion attacks typically rely on overly restrictive conditions (e.g., encrypted protocols, Tor, or specialized setups), or require detailed prior knowledge of the target (e.g., training data and model parameters), which is impractical in realistic black-box scenarios. The feasibility of a hard-label black-box evasion attack (i.e., applicable across diverse tasks and protocols without internal target insights) thus remains an open challenge. To this end, we develop NetMasquerade, which leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to manipulate attack flows to mimic benign traffic and evade detection. Specifically, we establish a tailored pre-trained model called Traffic-BERT, utilizing a network-specialized tokenizer and an attention mechanism to extract diverse benign traffic patterns. Subsequently, we integrate Traffic-BERT into the RL framework, allowing NetMasquerade to effectively manipulate malicious packet sequences based on benign traffic patterns with minimal modifications. Experimental results demonstrate that NetMasquerade enables both brute-force and stealthy attacks to evade 6 existing detection methods under 80 attack scenarios, achieving over 96.65% attack success rate. Notably, it can evade the methods that are either empirically or certifiably robust against existing evasion attacks. Finally, NetMasquerade achieves low-latency adversarial traffic generation, demonstrating its practicality in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Widely used IDM agents simply follow a lead vehicle and cannot react to vehicles in adjacent lanes, hindering tests of complex interaction capabilities. We address this issue by integrating the state-of-the-art learned traffic agent model SMART into nuPlan. Thus, we are the first to evaluate planners under more realistic conditions and quantify how conclusions shift when narrowing the sim-to-real gap. Our analysis covers 14 recent planners and established baselines and shows that IDM-based simulation overestimates planning performance: nearly all scores deteriorate. In contrast, many planners interact better than previously assumed and even improve in multi-lane, interaction-heavy scenarios like lane changes or turns. Methods trained in closed-loop demonstrate the best and most stable driving performance. However, when reaching their limits in augmented edge-case scenarios, all learned planners degrade abruptly, whereas rule-based planners maintain reasonable basic behavior. Based on our results, we suggest SMART-reactive simulation as a new standard closed-loop benchmark in nuPlan and release the SMART agents as a drop-in alternative to IDM at https://github.com/shgd95/InteractiveClosedLoop.</p></details> |  |

| **[The Fluorescent Veil: A Stealthy and Effective Physical Adversarial Patch Against Traffic Sign Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12394v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, traffic sign recognition (TSR) systems have become a prominent target for physical adversarial attacks. These attacks typically rely on conspicuous stickers and projections, or using invisible light and acoustic signals that can be easily blocked. In this paper, we introduce a novel attack medium, i.e., fluorescent ink, to design a stealthy and effective physical adversarial patch, namely FIPatch, to advance the state-of-the-art. Specifically, we first model the fluorescence effect in the digital domain to identify the optimal attack settings, which guide the real-world fluorescence parameters. By applying a carefully designed fluorescence perturbation to the target sign, the attacker can later trigger a fluorescent effect using invisible ultraviolet light, causing the TSR system to misclassify the sign and potentially leading to traffic accidents. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation to investigate the effectiveness of FIPatch, which shows a success rate of 98.31% in low-light conditions. Furthermore, our attack successfully bypasses five popular defenses and achieves a success rate of 96.72%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stability and Heavy-traffic Delay Optimality of General Load Balancing Policies in Heterogeneous Service Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14284v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a load balancing system consisting of $n$ single-server queues working in parallel, with heterogeneous service rates. Jobs arrive to a central dispatcher, which has to dispatch them to one of the queues immediately upon arrival. For this setting, we consider a broad family of policies where the dispatcher can only access the queue lengths sporadically, every $T$ units of time. We assume that the dispatching decisions are made based only on the order of the scaled queue lengths at the last time that the queues were accessed, and on the processing rate of each server. For these general policies, we provide easily verifiable necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of the system, and sufficient conditions for heavy-traffic delay optimality. We also show that, in heavy-traffic, the queue length converges in distribution to a scaled deterministic vector, where the scaling factor is an exponential random variable.</p></details> |  |
| **[An LLM-Powered AI Agent Framework for Holistic IoT Traffic Interpretation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13925v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Internet of Things (IoT) networks generate diverse and high-volume traffic that reflects both normal activity and potential threats. Deriving meaningful insight from such telemetry requires cross-layer interpretation of behaviors, protocols, and context rather than isolated detection. This work presents an LLM-powered AI agent framework that converts raw packet captures into structured and semantically enriched representations for interactive analysis. The framework integrates feature extraction, transformer-based anomaly detection, packet and flow summarization, threat intelligence enrichment, and retrieval-augmented question answering. An AI agent guided by a large language model performs reasoning over the indexed traffic artifacts, assembling evidence to produce accurate and human-readable interpretations. Experimental evaluation on multiple IoT captures and six open models shows that hybrid retrieval, which combines lexical and semantic search with reranking, substantially improves BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore results compared with dense-only retrieval. System profiling further indicates low CPU, GPU, and memory overhead, demonstrating that the framework achieves holistic and efficient interpretation of IoT network traffic.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory-based real-time pedestrian crash prediction at intersections: A novel non-linear link function for block maxima led Bayesian GEV framework addressing heterogeneous traffic condition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12963v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study develops a real-time framework for estimating pedestrian crash risk at signalized intersections under heterogeneous, non-lane-based traffic. Existing approaches often assume linear relationships between covariates and parameters, oversimplifying the complex, non-monotonic interactions among different road users. To overcome this, the framework introduces a non-linear link function within a Bayesian generalized extreme value (GEV) structure to capture traffic variability more accurately. The framework applies extreme value theory through the block maxima approach using post-encroachment time as a surrogate safety measure. A hierarchical Bayesian model incorporating both linear and non-linear link functions into GEV parameters is estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation. It also introduces a behavior-normalized Modified Crash Risk (MRC) formula to account for pedestrians' habitual risk-taking behavior. Seven Bayesian hierarchical models were developed and compared using deviance information criterion. Models employing non-linear link functions for the location and scale parameters significantly outperformed their linear counterparts. The results revealed that pedestrian speed has a negative relationship with crash risk, while flow and speed of motorized vehicles, pedestrian flow, and non-motorized vehicles conflicting speed contribute positively. The MRC formulation reduced overestimation and provided crash predictions with 93% confidence. The integration of non-linear link functions enhances model flexibility, capturing the non-linear nature of traffic extremes. The proposed MRC metric aligns crash risk estimates with real-world pedestrian behavior in mixed-traffic environments. This framework offers a practical analytical tool for traffic engineers and planners to design adaptive signal control and pedestrian safety interventions before crashes occur.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is a preprint and has not yet been peer-reviewed.

| **[Metronome: Efficient Scheduling for Periodic Traffic Jobs with Network and Priority Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12274v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth in computing power demand, cloud native networks have emerged as a promising solution to address the challenges of efficient resource coordination, particularly in coping with the dynamic fluctuations of network bandwidth in clusters. We propose Metronome, a network-aware and priority-aware scheduling mechanism for cloud native networks. This mechanism is designed to support jobs that exhibit periodic traffic patterns and dynamic bandwidth demands, particularly in the context of distributed training. Specifically, Metronome employs a time-division multiplexing approach that leverages job traffic characteristics to construct an elastic network resource allocation model, enabling efficient bandwidth sharing across multiple jobs. In addition, it incorporates a multi-objective optimization strategy, jointly considering latency and job priorities to achieve globally optimal as well as dynamic resource allocation. Finally, Metronome adapts to the dynamic environment by monitoring the cluster and performing reconfiguration operations. Extensive experiments with 13 common machine learning models demonstrate that Metronome can enhance cluster resource utilization while guaranteeing service performance. Compared with the existing Kubernetes scheduling mechanisms across multiple scenarios, Metronome reduces job completion time by up to 19.50% while improving average bandwidth utilization by up to 23.20%.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 16 figures.

| **[Stable and Fault-Tolerant Decentralized Traffic Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11937v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud providers have recently decentralized their wide-area network traffic engineering (TE) systems to contain the impact of TE controller failures. In the decentralized design, a controller fault only impacts its slice of the network, limiting the blast radius to a fraction of the network. However, we find that autonomous slice controllers can arrive at divergent traffic allocations that overload links by 30% beyond their capacity. We present Symphony, a decentralized TE system that addresses the challenge of divergence-induced congestion while preserving the fault-isolation benefits of decentralization. By augmenting TE objectives with quadratic regularization, Symphony makes traffic allocations robust to demand perturbations, ensuring TE controllers naturally converge to compatible allocations without coordination. In parallel, Symphony's randomized slicing algorithm partitions the network to minimize blast radius by distributing critical traffic sources across slices, preventing any single failure from becoming catastrophic. These innovations work in tandem: regularization ensures algorithmic stability to traffic allocations while intelligent slicing provides architectural resilience in the network. Through extensive evaluation on cloud provider WANs, we show Symphony reduces divergence-induced congestion by 14x and blast radius by 79% compared to current practice.</p></details> | 19 pages, 23 figures |

In this work, we present a unique dual-model framework that strategically utilizes the complementary strengths of VideoLLaMA and Qwen2.5-VL through task-specific optimization to address this issue. The core insight behind our approach is that separating training for captioning and visual question answering (VQA) tasks minimizes task interference and allows each model to specialize more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that VideoLLaMA is particularly effective in temporal reasoning, achieving a CIDEr score of 1.1001, while Qwen2.5-VL excels in visual understanding with a VQA accuracy of 60.80\%. Through extensive experiments on the WTS dataset, our method achieves an S2 score of 45.7572 in the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 2, placing 10th on the challenge leaderboard. Ablation studies validate that our separate training strategy outperforms joint training by 8.6\% in VQA accuracy while maintaining captioning quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Lightweight CNN-Based Wi-Fi Intrusion Detection Using 2D Traffic Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11898v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wi-Fi networks are ubiquitous in both home and enterprise environments, serving as a primary medium for Internet access and forming the backbone of modern IoT ecosystems. However, their inherent vulnerabilities, combined with widespread adoption, create opportunities for malicious actors to gain unauthorized access or compromise sensitive data stored on connected devices. To address these challenges, we propose a deep learning based network intrusion detection system (NIDS) for Wi-Fi environments. Building on our previous work, we convert network traffic into two-dimensional data representations and use them to train DL models based on convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. We implement five distinct techniques for generating the two-dimensional representations, and to ensure low detection latency, we adopt lightweight CNN architectures in our NIDS. The models are trained using the AWID3 dataset, a publicly available benchmark for Wi-Fi NIDS research, and are evaluated for both binary and multi-class classification tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive detection performance with low inference time, making it suitable for real-world Wi-Fi deployment scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[IntersectioNDE: Learning Complex Urban Traffic Dynamics based on Interaction Decoupling Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11534v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic traffic simulation is critical for ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially in complex and diverse urban traffic environments. However, existing data-driven simulators face two key challenges: a limited focus on modeling dense, heterogeneous interactions at urban intersections - which are prevalent, crucial, and practically significant in countries like China, featuring diverse agents including motorized vehicles (MVs), non-motorized vehicles (NMVs), and pedestrians - and the inherent difficulty in robustly learning high-dimensional joint distributions for such high-density scenes, often leading to mode collapse and long-term simulation instability. We introduce City Crossings Dataset (CiCross), a large-scale dataset collected from a real-world urban intersection, uniquely capturing dense, heterogeneous multi-agent interactions, particularly with a substantial proportion of MVs, NMVs and pedestrians. Based on this dataset, we propose IntersectioNDE (Intersection Naturalistic Driving Environment), a data-driven simulator tailored for complex urban intersection scenarios. Its core component is the Interaction Decoupling Strategy (IDS), a training paradigm that learns compositional dynamics from agent subsets, enabling the marginal-to-joint simulation. Integrated into a scene-aware Transformer network with specialized training techniques, IDS significantly enhances simulation robustness and long-term stability for modeling heterogeneous interactions. Experiments on CiCross show that IntersectioNDE outperforms baseline methods in simulation fidelity, stability, and its ability to replicate complex, distribution-level urban traffic dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ITSC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Vision-LLMs for Spatiotemporal Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11282v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate spatiotemporal traffic forecasting is a critical prerequisite for proactive resource management in dense urban mobile networks. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in time series analysis, they inherently struggle to model the complex spatial dependencies of grid-based traffic data. Effectively extending LLMs to this domain is challenging, as representing the vast amount of information from dense geographical grids can be inefficient and overwhelm the model's context. To address these challenges, we propose ST-Vision-LLM, a novel framework that reframes spatiotemporal forecasting as a vision-language fusion problem. Our approach leverages a Vision-LLM visual encoder to process historical global traffic matrices as image sequences, providing the model with a comprehensive global view to inform cell-level predictions. To overcome the inefficiency of LLMs in handling numerical data, we introduce an efficient encoding scheme that represents floating-point values as single tokens via a specialized vocabulary, coupled with a two-stage numerical alignment fine-tuning process. The model is first trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and then further optimized for predictive accuracy using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a memory-efficient reinforcement learning method. Evaluations on real-world mobile traffic datasets demonstrate that ST-Vision-LLM outperforms existing methods by 15.6% in long-term prediction accuracy and exceeds the second-best baseline by over 30.04% in cross-domain few-shot scenarios. Our extensive experiments validate the model's strong generalization capabilities across various data-scarce environments.</p></details> |  |

We construct two graphs: an undirected graph $\mathcal{G}^u$ capturing spatial correlations across geography, and a directed graph $\mathcal{G}^d$ capturing sequential relationships over time. We predict future samples of signal $\mathbf{x}$, assuming it is "smooth" with respect to both $\mathcal{G}^u$ and $\mathcal{G}^d$, where we design new $\ell_2$ and $\ell_1$-norm variational terms to quantify and promote signal smoothness (low-frequency reconstruction) on a directed graph. We design an iterative algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and unroll it into a feed-forward network for data-driven parameter learning. We insert graph learning modules for $\mathcal{G}^u$ and $\mathcal{G}^d$ that play the role of self-attention. Experiments show that our unrolled networks achieve competitive traffic forecast performance as state-of-the-art prediction schemes, while reducing parameter counts drastically.

This paper presents a multimodal framework combining open-vocabulary visual-language reasoning (CLIP), object detection (YOLO-World), and motion analysis via MOG2-based background subtraction. The system predicts congestion levels on an ordinal scale from 1 (free flow) to 5 (severe congestion), enabling semantically aligned and temporally consistent classification. To enhance interpretability, we incorporate motion-based confidence weighting and generate annotated visual outputs. Experimental results show the model achieves 76.7 percent accuracy, an F1 score of 0.752, and a Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.684, significantly outperforming unimodal baselines. These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in preserving ordinal structure and leveraging visual-language and motion modalities.

| **[Multi-Scale Diffusion Transformer for Jointly Simulating User Mobility and Mobile Traffic Pattern](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10158v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User mobility trajectory and mobile traffic data are essential for a wide spectrum of applications including urban planning, network optimization, and emergency management. However, large-scale and fine-grained mobility data remains difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns and collection costs, making it essential to simulate realistic mobility and traffic patterns. User trajectories and mobile traffic are fundamentally coupled, reflecting both physical mobility and cyber behavior in urban environments. Despite this strong interdependence, existing studies often model them separately, limiting the ability to capture cross-modal dynamics. Therefore, a unified framework is crucial. In this paper, we propose MSTDiff, a Multi-Scale Diffusion Transformer for joint simulation of mobile traffic and user trajectories. First, MSTDiff applies discrete wavelet transforms for multi-resolution traffic decomposition. Second, it uses a hybrid denoising network to process continuous traffic volumes and discrete location sequences. A transition mechanism based on urban knowledge graph embedding similarity is designed to guide semantically informed trajectory generation. Finally, a multi-scale Transformer with cross-attention captures dependencies between trajectories and traffic. Experiments show that MSTDiff surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in traffic and trajectory generation tasks, reducing Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) across key statistical metrics by up to 17.38% for traffic generation, and by an average of 39.53% for trajectory generation.

| **[Scaling Traffic Insights with AI and Language Model-Powered Camera Systems for Data-Driven Transportation Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09981v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate, scalable traffic monitoring is critical for real-time and long-term transportation management, particularly during disruptions such as natural disasters, large construction projects, or major policy changes like New York City's first-in-the-nation congestion pricing program. However, widespread sensor deployment remains limited due to high installation, maintenance, and data management costs. While traffic cameras offer a cost-effective alternative, existing video analytics struggle with dynamic camera viewpoints and massive data volumes from large camera networks. This study presents an end-to-end AI-based framework leveraging existing traffic camera infrastructure for high-resolution, longitudinal analysis at scale. A fine-tuned YOLOv11 model, trained on localized urban scenes, extracts multimodal traffic density and classification metrics in real time. To address inconsistencies from non-stationary pan-tilt-zoom cameras, we introduce a novel graph-based viewpoint normalization method. A domain-specific large language model was also integrated to process massive data from a 24/7 video stream to generate frequent, automated summaries of evolving traffic patterns, a task far exceeding manual capabilities. We validated the system using over 9 million images from roughly 1,000 traffic cameras during the early rollout of NYC congestion pricing in 2025. Results show a 9% decline in weekday passenger vehicle density within the Congestion Relief Zone, early truck volume reductions with signs of rebound, and consistent increases in pedestrian and cyclist activity at corridor and zonal scales. Experiments showed that example-based prompts improved LLM's numerical accuracy and reduced hallucinations. These findings demonstrate the framework's potential as a practical, infrastructure-ready solution for large-scale, policy-relevant traffic monitoring with minimal human intervention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Network Traffic as a Scalable Ethnographic Lens for Understanding University Students' AI Tool Practices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09763v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-driven applications have become woven into students' academic and creative workflows, influencing how they learn, write, and produce ideas. Gaining a nuanced understanding of these usage patterns is essential, yet conventional survey and interview methods remain limited by recall bias, self-presentation effects, and the underreporting of habitual behaviors. While ethnographic methods offer richer contextual insights, they often face challenges of scale and reproducibility. To bridge this gap, we introduce a privacy-conscious approach that repurposes VPN-based network traffic analysis as a scalable ethnographic technique for examining students' real-world engagement with AI tools. By capturing anonymized metadata rather than content, this method enables fine-grained behavioral tracing while safeguarding personal information, thereby complementing self-report data. A three-week field deployment with university students reveals fragmented, short-duration interactions across multiple tools and devices, with intense bursts of activity coinciding with exam periods-patterns mirroring institutional rhythms of academic life. We conclude by discussing methodological, ethical, and empirical implications, positioning network traffic analysis as a promising avenue for large-scale digital ethnography on technology-in-practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Traffic-Aware Eco-Driving Control in CAVs via Learning-based Terminal Cost Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08980v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) offer significant potential for improving energy efficiency and lowering vehicle emissions through eco-driving technologies. Control algorithms in CAVs leverage look-ahead route information and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to optimize vehicle performance. However, existing eco-driving strategies often neglect macroscopic traffic effects, such as upstream traffic jams, that occur outside the optimization horizon but significantly impact vehicle energy efficiency. This work presents a novel Neural Network (NN)-based methodology to approximate the terminal cost within a model predictive control (MPC) problem framework, explicitly incorporating upstream traffic dynamics. By incorporating traffic jams into the optimization process, the proposed traffic-aware approach yields more energy-efficient speed trajectories compared to traffic-agnostic methods, with minimal impact on travel time. The framework is scalable for real-time implementation while effectively addressing uncertainties from dynamic traffic conditions and macroscopic traffic events.</p></details> |  |

Their strong generalisation abilities make them a promising component for automated driving systems, which must handle unexpected corner cases. However, to be trusted in such safety-critical applications, a model must first possess a reliable perception system. Moreover, since critical objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at a distance, we require systems that are not "shortsighted", i.e., systems with strong perception capabilities at both close (up to 20 meters) and long (30+ meters) range. With this in mind, we introduce Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question Answering (DTPQA), the first Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark focused solely on perception-based questions in traffic scenes, enriched with distance annotations. By excluding questions that require reasoning, we ensure that model performance reflects perception capabilities alone. Since automated driving hardware has limited processing power and cannot support large VLMs, our study centers on smaller VLMs. More specifically, we evaluate several state-of-the-art (SOTA) small VLMs on DTPQA and show that, despite the simplicity of the questions, these models significantly underperform compared to humans (~60% average accuracy for the best-performing small VLM versus ~85% human performance). However, it is important to note that the human sample size was relatively small, which imposes statistical limitations. We also identify specific perception tasks, such as distinguishing left from right, that remain particularly challenging for these models.</p></details> |  |

While recent graph neural network approaches have advanced spatial temporal modeling, existing mixture of experts frameworks like Time Enhanced Spatio Temporal Attention Model (TESTAM) lack explicit incorporation of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial capabilities. We present TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio temporal forecasting framework that introduces a novel SpatioSemantic Expert integrating physical road topology with data driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. TESTAM+ achieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA (3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through comprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection fundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts demonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on PEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the SpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The optimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction compared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing inference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+. Our findings reveal that fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex multi expert ensembles, establishing new state of the art performance with superior computational efficiency for real time deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE ICTAI 2025.

We demonstrate that these interactive behaviors leave distinctive fingerprints in encrypted traffic exchanged between users and LLM agents. By analyzing traffic patterns associated with agent workflows and tool invocations, adversaries can infer agent activities, distinguish specific agents, and even profile sensitive user attributes. To highlight this risk, we develop AgentPrint, which achieves an F1-score of 0.866 in agent identification and attains 73.9% and 69.1% top-3 accuracy in user attribute inference for simulated- and real-user settings, respectively. These results uncover an overlooked risk: the very interactivity that empowers LLM agents also exposes user privacy, underscoring the urgent need for technical countermeasures alongside regulatory and policy safeguards.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages with 11 figures</p></details> |
| **[GNN-enhanced Traffic Anomaly Detection for Next-Generation SDN-Enabled Consumer Electronics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07109v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consumer electronics (CE) connected to the Internet of Things are susceptible to various attacks, including DDoS and web-based threats, which can compromise their functionality and facilitate remote hijacking. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to exploit CE for broader system attacks while enabling the propagation of malicious code across the CE network, resulting in device failures. Existing deep learning-based traffic anomaly detection systems exhibit high accuracy in traditional network environments but are often overly complex and reliant on static infrastructure, necessitating manual configuration and management. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable network model that integrates Software-defined Networking (SDN) and Compute First Networking (CFN) for next-generation CE networks. In this network model, we propose a Graph Neural Networks-based Network Anomaly Detection framework (GNN-NAD) that integrates SDN-based CE networks and enables the CFN architecture. GNN-NAD uniquely fuses a static, vulnerability-aware attack graph with dynamic traffic features, providing a holistic view of network security. The core of the framework is a GNN model (GSAGE) for graph representation learning, followed by a Random Forest (RF) classifier.

To tackle this issue, past research has explored the applicability of traffic correlation techniques to perform attack attribution, i.e., to identify an attacker's true network location. However, current traffic correlation approaches rely on well-provisioned and centralized systems that ingest flows from multiple network probes to compute correlation scores. Unfortunately, this makes correlation efforts scale poorly for large high-speed networks. In this paper, we propose RevealNet, a decentralized framework for attack attribution that orchestrates a fleet of P4-programmable switches to perform traffic correlation. RevealNet builds on a set of correlation primitives inspired by prior work on computing and comparing flow sketches -- compact summaries of flows' key characteristics -- to enable efficient, distributed, in-network traffic correlation. Our evaluation suggests that RevealNet achieves comparable accuracy to centralized attack attribution systems while significantly reducing both the computational complexity and bandwidth overheads imposed by correlation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 23rd IEEE International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications (NCA)</p></details> |
| **[DecompGAIL: Learning Realistic Traffic Behaviors with Decomposed Multi-Agent Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06913v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic traffic simulation is critical for the development of autonomous driving systems and urban mobility planning, yet existing imitation learning approaches often fail to model realistic traffic behaviors. Behavior cloning suffers from covariate shift, while Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) is notoriously unstable in multi-agent settings. We identify a key source of this instability: irrelevant interaction misguidance, where a discriminator penalizes an ego vehicle's realistic behavior due to unrealistic interactions among its neighbors. To address this, we propose Decomposed Multi-agent GAIL (DecompGAIL), which explicitly decomposes realism into ego-map and ego-neighbor components, filtering out misleading neighbor: neighbor and neighbor: map interactions. We further introduce a social PPO objective that augments ego rewards with distance-weighted neighborhood rewards, encouraging overall realism across agents. Integrated into a lightweight SMART-based backbone, DecompGAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WOMD Sim Agents 2025 benchmark.</p></details> |  |

The task requires modeling both fine-grained (pixel-level) and coarse (region-level) spatial structure while preserving temporal relationships across long sequences. Building on Conv-LSTM ideas, we introduce a tile-aware, cascaded-memory Conv-LSTM augmented with cross-frame additive attention and a memory-flexible training scheme: frames are sampled per spatial tile so the model learns tile-local dynamics and per-tile memory cells can be updated sparsely, paged, or compressed to scale to large maps. We provide a compact theoretical analysis (tight softmax/attention Lipschitz bound and a tiling error lower bound) explaining stability and the memory-accuracy tradeoffs, and empirically demonstrate improved scalability and competitive forecasting performance on large-scale traffic heatmaps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neuri...</summary><p>Neurips 2019 Traffic4Cast Challenge, v4: added formal proofs</p></details> |
| **[Impact of Packet Loss and Timing Errors on Scheduled Periodic Traffic with Time-Aware Shaping (TAS) in Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05290v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a collection of mechanisms to enhance the realtime transmission capability of Ethernet networks. TSN combines priority queuing, traffic scheduling, and the Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) to carry periodic traffic with ultra-low latency and jitter. That is, so-called Talkers send periodic traffic with highest priority according to a schedule. The schedule is designed such that the scheduled traffic is forwarded by the TSN bridges with no or only little queuing delay. To protect that traffic against other frames, the TAS is configured on all interfaces such that lower-priority queues can send only when high-priority traffic is not supposed to be forwarded. In the literature on scheduling algorithms for the TAS there is mostly the explicit or implicit assumption that the TAS also limits transmission slots of high-priority traffic. In this paper we show that this assumption can lead to tremendous problems like very long queuing delay or even packet loss in case of faulty frames. A faulty frame arrives too early or too late according to the schedule, it is missing or additional. We construct minimal examples to illustrate basic effects of faulty frames on a single link and demonstrate how this effect can propagate through the networks and cause remote problems. We further show using simulations that a single slightly delayed frame may lead to frame loss on multiple links. We show that these problems can be alleviated or avoided when TAS-based transmission slots for high-priority traffic are configured longer than needed or if they are not limited at all.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating UORA-Based Polling Mechanism for Latency-Sensitive Uplink Traffic in Wi-Fi Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04731v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>IEEE 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) introduced Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), which enables simultaneous transmissions through centralized resource allocation. However, effective uplink scheduling requires the Access Point (AP) to identify which stations (STAs) have data to transmit. This typically necessitates polling for buffer status reports, a process that becomes increasingly inefficient and unscalable with growing device density. In this paper, we study how the Uplink OFDMA-based Random Access (UORA) feature improves the scalability and delay experienced by latency-sensitive data streams. We show that UORA enables efficient uplink scheduling while opportunistically identifying buffered traffic from unscheduled STAs, striking a balance between coordination and scalability. Performance evaluation of different polling strategies is done by means of simulation in ns-3. The results indicate that UORA-based polling outperforms alternative schemes in densely deployed network environments with heterogeneous uplink traffic patterns. Furthermore, under highly sparse and sporadic traffic conditions, UORA-based polling yields over 40% delay reduction compared to Scheduled Access (SA) OFDMA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating mixed traffic dynamics of pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles at urban intersections: Observation experiments and modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04423v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban intersections with mixed pedestrian and non-motorized vehicle traffic present complex safety challenges, yet traditional models fail to account for dynamic interactions arising from speed heterogeneity and collision anticipation. This study introduces the Time and Angle Based Social Force Model (TASFM), an enhanced framework extending the classical Social Force Model by integrating Time-to-Collision (TTC) metrics and velocity-angle-dependent tangential forces to simulate collision avoidance behaviors more realistically. Using aerial trajectory data from a high-density intersection in Shenzhen, China, we validated TASFM against real-world scenarios, achieving a Mean Trajectory Error (MTE) of 0.154 m (0.77% of the experimental area width). Key findings reveal distinct behavioral patterns: pedestrians self-organize into lanes along designated routes (e.g., zebra crossings), while non-motorized vehicles exhibit flexible path deviations that heighten collision risks. Simulations of three conflict types (overtaking, frontal/lateral crossing) demonstrate TASFM's capacity to replicate adaptive strategies like bidirectional path adjustments and speed modulation. The model provides actionable insights for urban planners, including conflict hotspot prediction and infrastructure redesign (e.g., segregated lanes), while offering a scalable framework for future research integrating motorized traffic and environmental variables. This work advances the understanding of mixed traffic dynamics and bridges the gap between theoretical modeling and data-driven urban safety solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributed MPC-based Coordination of Traffic Perimeter and Signal Control: A Lexicographic Optimization Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04038v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a comprehensive strategy that integrates traffic perimeter control with traffic signal control to alleviate congestion in an urban traffic network (UTN). The strategy is formulated as a lexicographic multi-objective optimization problem, starting with the regulation of traffic inflows at boundary junctions to maximize the capacity while ensuring a smooth operation of the UTN. Following this, the signal timings at internal junctions are collaboratively optimized to enhance overall traffic conditions under the regulated inflows. The use of a model predictive control (MPC) approach ensures that the control solution adheres to safety and capacity constraints within the network. To address the computational complexity of the problem, the UTN is divided into subnetworks, each managed by a local agent. A distributed solution method based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is employed, allowing each agent to determine its optimal control decisions using local information from its subnetwork and neighboring agents. Numerical simulations using VISSIM and MATLAB demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed traffic control strategy.</p></details> |  |

Conventional systems relying on static signals and manual monitoring are inadequate for the dynamic nature of modern traffic. This research aims to develop a unified framework that integrates CCTV surveillance videos with multi-source data descriptors to enhance real-time urban traffic prediction. The proposed methodology incorporates spatio-temporal feature fusion, Frequent Episode Mining for sequential traffic pattern discovery, and a hybrid LSTM-Transformer model for robust traffic state forecasting. The framework was evaluated on the CityFlowV2 dataset comprising 313,931 annotated bounding boxes across 46 cameras. It achieved a high prediction accuracy of 98.46 percent, with a macro precision of 0.9800, macro recall of 0.9839, and macro F1-score of 0.9819. FEM analysis revealed significant sequential patterns such as moderate-congested transitions with confidence levels exceeding 55 percent. The 46 sustained congestion alerts are system-generated, which shows practical value for proactive congestion management. This emphasizes the need for the incorporation of video stream analytics with data from multiple sources for the design of real-time, responsive, adaptable multi-level intelligent transportation systems, which makes urban mobility smarter and safer.</p></details> | 24 pages, 9 figures |

Electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye-tracking features, extracted from an open-source dataset, were used to train and evaluate both conventional machine learning models and SNNs. Among the SNN architectures explored, a minimalistic, single-layer model trained with a biologically inspired delta-rule learning algorithm achieved competitive performance (80.6%). To enable deployment on neuromorphic hardware, the model was quantized and implemented on the mixed-signal DYNAP-SE chip. Despite hardware constraints and analog variability, the chip-deployed SNN maintained a classification accuracy of up to 73.5% using spike-based input. These results demonstrate the feasibility of event-driven neuromorphic systems for ultra-low-power, embedded cognitive state monitoring in dynamic real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version.

| **[Estimating link level traffic emissions: enhancing MOVES with open-source data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03362v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-source data offers a scalable and transparent foundation for estimating vehicle activity and emissions in urban regions. In this study, we propose a data-driven framework that integrates MOVES and open-source GPS trajectory data, OpenStreetMap (OSM) road networks, regional traffic datasets and satellite imagery-derived feature vectors to estimate the link level operating mode distribution and traffic emissions. A neural network model is trained to predict the distribution of MOVES-defined operating modes using only features derived from readily available data. The proposed methodology was applied using open-source data related to 45 municipalities in the Boston Metropolitan area. The "ground truth" operating mode distribution was established using OSM open-source GPS trajectories. Compared to the MOVES baseline, the proposed model reduces RMSE by over 50% for regional scale traffic emissions of key pollutants including CO, NOx, CO2, and PM2.5. This study demonstrates the feasibility of low-cost, replicable, and data-driven emissions estimation using fully open data sources.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequence-Preserving Dual-FoV Defense for Traffic Sign and Light Recognition in Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02642v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic light and sign recognition are key for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) because perception mistakes directly influence navigation and safety. In addition to digital adversarial attacks, models are vulnerable to existing perturbations (glare, rain, dirt, or graffiti), which could lead to dangerous misclassifications. The current work lacks consideration of temporal continuity, multistatic field-of-view (FoV) sensing, and robustness to both digital and natural degradation. This study proposes a dual FoV, sequence-preserving robustness framework for traffic lights and signs in the USA based on a multi-source dataset built on aiMotive, Udacity, Waymo, and self-recorded videos from the region of Texas. Mid and long-term sequences of RGB images are temporally aligned for four operational design domains (ODDs): highway, night, rainy, and urban. Over a series of experiments on a real-life application of anomaly detection, this study outlines a unified three-layer defense stack framework that incorporates feature squeezing, defensive distillation, and entropy-based anomaly detection, as well as sequence-wise temporal voting for further enhancement. The evaluation measures included accuracy, attack success rate (ASR), risk-weighted misclassification severity, and confidence stability. Physical transferability was confirmed using probes for recapture. The results showed that the Unified Defense Stack achieved 79.8mAP and reduced the ASR to 18.2%, which is superior to YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and BEVFormer, while reducing the high-risk misclassification to 32%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Grained Urban Traffic Forecasting on Metropolis-Scale Road Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02278v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting on road networks is a complex task of significant practical importance that has recently attracted considerable attention from the machine learning community, with spatiotemporal graph neural networks (GNNs) becoming the most popular approach. The proper evaluation of traffic forecasting methods requires realistic datasets, but current publicly available benchmarks have significant drawbacks, including the absence of information about road connectivity for road graph construction, limited information about road properties, and a relatively small number of road segments that falls short of real-world applications. Further, current datasets mostly contain information about intercity highways with sparsely located sensors, while city road networks arguably present a more challenging forecasting task due to much denser roads and more complex urban traffic patterns. In this work, we provide a more complete, realistic, and challenging benchmark for traffic forecasting by releasing datasets representing the road networks of two major cities, with the largest containing almost 100,000 road segments (more than a 10-fold increase relative to existing datasets). Our datasets contain rich road features and provide fine-grained data about both traffic volume and traffic speed, allowing for building more holistic traffic forecasting systems. We show that most current implementations of neural spatiotemporal models for traffic forecasting have problems scaling to datasets of our size. To overcome this issue, we propose an alternative approach to neural traffic forecasting that uses a GNN without a dedicated module for temporal sequence processing, thus achieving much better scalability, while also demonstrating stronger forecasting performance. We hope our datasets and modeling insights will serve as a valuable resource for research in traffic forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Low Power Traffic Pattern for Energy Constrained Wireless Sensor Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00588v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are extensively utilized in critical applications, including remote monitoring, target tracking, healthcare systems, industrial automation, and smart control in both residential and industrial settings. One of the primary challenges in these systems is maintaining energy efficiency, given that most sensor nodes rely on limited battery resources. To tackle this problem, this study introduces an energy-saving strategy designed for tree-structured networks with dynamic traffic patterns. The approach focuses on lowering power usage by decreasing the length and occurrence of idle listening state where nodes remain active unnecessarily while waiting for data transmissions that may never occur. By reducing this form of energy waste, the proposed approach is designed to extend the operational lifetime and enhance the throughput of the wireless sensor network. Simulation results obtained using the OMNeT++ simulator with the MiXiM framework demonstrate that the solution significantly reduces energy consumption, increases data throughput, and improves overall network efficiency and longevity.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Coordinated Routing Approach for Enhancing Bus Timeliness and Travel Efficiency in Mixed-Traffic Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01566v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a coordinated routing strategy aimed at improving bus schedule adherence and enhancing travel efficiency for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) operating within a mixed-traffic urban network. Our approach capitalizes on the existence of dedicated lanes for buses and CAVs, leveraging real-time traffic data to dynamically reroute CAVs in anticipation of congestion. By continuously monitoring traffic conditions on dedicated lanes and tracking the real-time positions of buses, we enable the system to proactively adjust CAV routes when potential interference with bus operations is detected. This coordination mitigates delays affecting transit services and reduces travel time for CAVs. We evaluate the proposed strategy through simulation studies conducted in the SUMO. The results demonstrate significant improvements in both transit reliability and CAV operational performance across a range of traffic conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enabling Time-Aware Priority Traffic Management over Distributed FPGA Nodes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26043v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network Interface Cards (NICs) greatly evolved from simple basic devices moving traffic in and out of the network to complex heterogeneous systems offloading host CPUs from performing complex tasks on in-transit packets. These latter comprise different types of devices, ranging from NICs accelerating fixed specific functions (e.g., on-the-fly data compression/decompression, checksum computation, data encryption, etc.) to complex Systems-on-Chip (SoC) equipped with both general purpose processors and specialized engines (Smart-NICs). Similarly, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) moved from pure reprogrammable devices to modern heterogeneous systems comprising general-purpose processors, real-time cores and even AI-oriented engines. Furthermore, the availability of high-speed network interfaces (e.g., SFPs) makes modern FPGAs a good choice for implementing Smart-NICs. In this work, we extended the functionalities offered by an open-source NIC implementation (Corundum) by enabling time-aware traffic management in hardware, and using this feature to control the bandwidth associated with different traffic classes. By exposing dedicated control registers on the AXI bus, the driver of the NIC can easily configure the transmission bandwidth of different prioritized queues. Basically, each control register is associated with a specific transmission queue (Corundum can expose up to thousands of transmission and receiving queues), and sets up the fraction of time in a transmission window which the queue is supposed to get access the output port and transmit the packets. Queues are then prioritized and associated to different traffic classes through the Linux QDISC mechanism. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the approach allows to properly manage the bandwidth reserved to the different transmission flows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cooperative Autonomous Driving in Diverse Behavioral Traffic: A Heterogeneous Graph Reinforcement Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25751v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating heterogeneous traffic environments with diverse driving styles poses a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs) due to their inherent complexity and dynamic interactions. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a heterogeneous graph reinforcement learning (GRL) framework enhanced with an expert system to improve AV decision-making performance. Initially, a heterogeneous graph representation is introduced to capture the intricate interactions among vehicles. Then, a heterogeneous graph neural network with an expert model (HGNN-EM) is proposed to effectively encode diverse vehicle features and produce driving instructions informed by domain-specific knowledge. Moreover, the double deep Q-learning (DDQN) algorithm is utilized to train the decision-making model. A case study on a typical four-way intersection, involving various driving styles of human vehicles (HVs), demonstrates that the proposed method has superior performance over several baselines regarding safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence rate, all while maintaining favorable real-time performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures and 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Optimized dynamic scheduling of an exclusive bus lane or high occupancy vehicle lane in a bimodal traffic corridor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08729v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient management of traffic corridors is critical for sustaining urban mobility. Exclusive bus lane (EBL) and high occupancy vehicle lane (HOVL) are two prominent strategies for enhancing public transit services and alleviating congestion. EBLs prioritize bus transit by providing dedicated lanes for faster travel times, while HOVLs encourage carpooling by reserving lanes for high-occupancy vehicles. However, static implementations of these policies may underutilize road resources and disrupt general-purpose lanes. Dynamic implementation, based on real-time demand, can potentially maximize road efficiency and minimize negative impacts. This study first compares the mixed traffic policy (MTP), exclusive bus lane policy (EBLP), and high occupancy vehicle lane policy (HOVLP) by formulating the total system costs in the context of a bimodal traffic corridor involving private cars and public buses. Under each lane policy, the bus frequency is optimized together with the modal split equilibrium derived separately. Based on dynamic demand simulated using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (O-U) process, switching thresholds are then derived to identify optimal periods for implementing each policy. Results reveal significant reductions in total system costs with the proposed dynamic policy schedules. Compared to static implementations, the dynamic policy schedules achieve cost reductions of 11.9%, 6.70%, and 43.64% relative to MTP-only, EBLP-only, and HOVLP-only scenarios, respectively. Additionally, in two real case studies of existing EBL and HOVL operations in Seattle, the proposed dynamic policy reduces total costs by 32.5% and 28.6%, respectively. The findings provide valuable insights for policymakers and transit planners, offering a robust framework for dynamically scheduling and integrating EBL and HOVL policies to optimize urban corridor efficiency and reduce overall system costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version is identical to the manuscript submitted to International Journal of Sustainable Transportation.

We present a simulation-based framework for modeling, detecting, and predicting such anomalies in urban networks. Using the SUMO platform, we generate reproducible rear-end and intersection crash scenarios with matched baselines, enabling controlled experimentation and comparative evaluation. We record vehicle-level travel time, speed, and emissions for edge and network-level analysis. On this dataset, we develop a hybrid forecasting architecture that combines bidirectional long short-term memory networks with a diffusion convolutional recurrent neural network to capture temporal dynamics and spatial dependencies. Our simulation studies on the Broadway corridor in New York City demonstrate the framework's ability to reproduce consistent incident conditions, quantify their effects, and provide accurate multi-horizon traffic forecasts. Our results highlight the value of combining controlled anomaly generation with deep predictive models to support reproducible evaluation and sustainable traffic management.</p></details> |  |
| **[Path Diffuser: Diffusion Model for Data-Driven Traffic Simulator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24995v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating diverse and realistic traffic scenarios is critical for developing and testing autonomous planning. Traditional rule-based planners lack diversity and realism, while learning-based simulators often replay, forecast, or edit scenarios using historical agent trajectories. However, they struggle to generate new scenarios, limiting scalability and diversity due to their reliance on fully annotated logs and historical data. Thus, a key challenge for a learning-based simulator's performance is that it requires agents' past trajectories and pose information in addition to map data, which might not be available for all agents on the road.Without which, generated scenarios often produce unrealistic trajectories that deviate from drivable areas, particularly under out-of-distribution (OOD) map scenes (e.g., curved roads). To address this, we propose Path Diffuser (PD): a two-stage, diffusion model for generating agent pose initializations and their corresponding trajectories conditioned on the map, free of any historical context of agents' trajectories. Furthermore, PD incorporates a motion primitive-based prior, leveraging Frenet frame candidate trajectories to enhance diversity while ensuring road-compliant trajectory generation. We also explore various design choices for modeling complex multi-agent interactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on the Argoverse2 Dataset and additionally evaluate the generalizability of the approach on OOD map variants. Notably, Path Diffuser outperforms the baseline methods by 1.92x on distribution metrics, 1.14x on common-sense metrics, and 1.62x on road compliance from adversarial benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Human Drivers and Connected Autonomous Vehicles Co-exist in Lane-Free Traffic? A Microscopic Simulation Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01189v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology have sparked growing research interest in lane-free traffic (LFT). LFT envisions a scenario where all vehicles are CAVs, coordinating their movements without lanes to achieve smoother traffic flow and higher road capacity. This potentially reduces congestion without building new infrastructure. However, the transition phase will likely involve non-connected actors such as human-driven vehicles (HDVs) or independent AVs sharing the roads. This raises the question of how LFT performance is impacted when not all vehicles are CAVs, as these non-connected vehicles may prioritize their own benefits over system-wide improvements. This paper addresses this question through microscopic simulation on a ring road, where CAVs follow the potential lines (PL) controller for LFT, while HDVs adhere to a strip-based car-following model. The PL controller is also modified for safe velocities to prevent collisions. The results reveal that even a small percentage of HDVs can significantly disrupt LFT flow: 5% HDVs can reduce LFT's maximum road capacity by 20% and a 40% HDVs nearly halves it, up until 100% HDVs where it drops by nearly 60%. The study also develops an adaptive potential line (APL) controller that forms APL corridors in the surroundings of HDVs. APL shows a peak traffic flow improvement of nearly 10% over the PL controller. The study indicates that a penetration rate of approximately 60% CAVs is required to start observing the major LFT benefits. These findings open a new research direction on minimizing the adverse effects of non-connected vehicles on LFT.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version corresponds to the final published article in Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies.

The crash- and conflict-based analyses do not incorporate the socio-demographic characteristics of the roundabout users, which can only be captured through questionnaire surveys on a larger scale. This research evaluated the relationship of roundabout safety perception with demographic factors, driving characteristics, and varying roundabout geometries using multiple correspondence analysis, cluster analysis, factor analysis, and multinomial logistic regression. The study analyzed data from 1,530 respondents across two Indian cities. The study identified three roundabout user clusters. Single-lane roundabouts were perceived as safer during entry and circulation, with a significant prominence among middle-aged users. In contrast, double- and multi-lane roundabouts presented higher perceived risks during exit maneuvers, especially among young, inexperienced, unemployed/self-employed users. Vulnerable road users reported significantly higher perceived risks, especially under suboptimal lighting conditions. Respondents with 10-20 years of driving experience, especially car users, perceived lower risk at single-lane roundabouts but acknowledged the higher risk linked to speed variations and complex maneuvers at multi-lane roundabouts. Driving experience, vehicle type, and geometric configurations were crucial in roundabout safety perception. The study highlighted the need to improve the built environment of roundabouts for vulnerable road users. The roundabout merging area was perceived as the most dangerous spot; however, exits were also perceived as dangerous for double- and multi-lane roundabouts. The findings can benefit policymakers, engineers, and urban planners by enabling them to deploy targeted safety interventions based on issues highlighted in the study.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Multi-agent Traffic Simulation via R1-Style Reinforcement Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23993v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scalable and realistic simulation of multi-agent traffic behavior is critical for advancing autonomous driving technologies. Although existing data-driven simulators have made significant strides in this domain, they predominantly rely on supervised learning to align simulated distributions with real-world driving scenarios. A persistent challenge, however, lies in the distributional shift that arises between training and testing, which often undermines model generalization in unseen environments. To address this limitation, we propose SMART-R1, a novel R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning paradigm tailored for next-token prediction models to better align agent behavior with human preferences and evaluation metrics. Our approach introduces a metric-oriented policy optimization algorithm to improve distribution alignment and an iterative "SFT-RFT-SFT" training strategy that alternates between Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to maximize performance gains. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) validate the effectiveness of this simple yet powerful R1-style training framework in enhancing foundation models. The results on the Waymo Open Sim Agents Challenge (WOSAC) showcase that SMART-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an overall realism meta score of 0.7858, ranking first on the leaderboard at the time of submission.</p></details> |  |
| **[VFSI: Validity First Spatial Intelligence for Constraint-Guided Traffic Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23971v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern diffusion models generate realistic traffic simulations but systematically violate physical constraints. In a large-scale evaluation of SceneDiffuser++, a state-of-the-art traffic simulator, we find that 50% of generated trajectories violate basic physical laws - vehicles collide, drive off roads, and spawn inside buildings. This reveals a fundamental limitation: current models treat physical validity as an emergent property rather than an architectural requirement. We propose Validity-First Spatial Intelligence (VFSI), which enforces constraints through energy-based guidance during diffusion sampling, without model retraining. By incorporating collision avoidance and kinematic constraints as energy functions, we guide the denoising process toward physically valid trajectories. Across 200 urban scenarios from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, VFSI reduces collision rates by 67% (24.6% to 8.1%) and improves overall validity by 87% (50.3% to 94.2%), while simultaneously improving realism metrics (ADE: 1.34m to 1.21m). Our model-agnostic approach demonstrates that explicit constraint enforcement during inference is both necessary and sufficient for physically valid traffic simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Explain Air Traffic Situation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10764v3)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how air traffic controllers construct a mental 'picture' of complex air traffic situations is crucial but remains a challenge due to the inherently intricate, high-dimensional interactions between aircraft, pilots, and controllers. Previous work on modeling the strategies of air traffic controllers and their mental image of traffic situations often centers on specific air traffic control tasks or pairwise interactions between aircraft, neglecting to capture the comprehensive dynamics of an air traffic situation. To address this issue, we propose a machine learning-based framework for explaining air traffic situations. Specifically, we employ a Transformer-based multi-agent trajectory model that encapsulates both the spatio-temporal movement of aircraft and social interaction between them. By deriving attention scores from the model, we can quantify the influence of individual aircraft on overall traffic dynamics. This provides explainable insights into how air traffic controllers perceive and understand the traffic situation. Trained on real-world air traffic surveillance data collected from the terminal airspace around Incheon International Airport in South Korea, our framework effectively explicates air traffic situations. This could potentially support and enhance the decision-making and situational awareness of air traffic controllers.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, minor revisions to address reviewer feedback for final submission to the First US-Europe Air Transportation Research and Development (ATRD) Symposium</p></details> |

With the popularity of devices, related security and privacy risks arise at the same time as they collect user-related data and transmit it to various service providers. Although China accounts for a larger share of the consumer IoT industry, current analyses on consumer IoT device traffic primarily focus on regions such as Europe, the United States, and Australia. Research on China, however, is currently relatively rare. This study constructs the first large-scale dataset about consumer IoT device traffic in China. Specifically, we propose a fine-grained traffic collection guidance covering the entire lifecycle of consumer IoT devices, gathering traffic from 77 devices spanning 38 brands and 12 device categories. Based on this dataset, we analyze traffic destinations and encryption practices across different device types during the entire lifecycle and compare the findings with the results of other regions. Compared to other regions, our results show that consumer IoT devices in China rely more on domestic services and overall perform better in terms of encryption practices. However, there are still 23/40 devices improperly conducting certificate validation, and 2/70 devices use insecure encryption protocols. To facilitate future research, we open-source our traffic collection guidance and make our dataset publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted by "Science China Information Sciences" on September 18, 2025.

| **[FuzzyLight: A Robust Two-Stage Fuzzy Approach for Traffic Signal Control Works in Real Cities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15820v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective traffic signal control (TSC) is crucial in mitigating urban congestion and reducing emissions. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been the research trend for TSC. However, existing RL algorithms face several real-world challenges that hinder their practical deployment in TSC: (1) Sensor accuracy deteriorates with increased sensor detection range, and data transmission is prone to noise, potentially resulting in unsafe TSC decisions. (2) During the training of online RL, interactions with the environment could be unstable, potentially leading to inappropriate traffic signal phase (TSP) selection and traffic congestion. (3) Most current TSC algorithms focus only on TSP decisions, overlooking the critical aspect of phase duration, affecting safety and efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose a robust two-stage fuzzy approach called FuzzyLight, which integrates compressed sensing and RL for TSC deployment. FuzzyLight offers several key contributions: (1) It employs fuzzy logic and compressed sensing to address sensor noise and enhances the efficiency of TSP decisions. (2) It maintains stable performance during training and combines fuzzy logic with RL to generate precise phases. (3) It works in real cities across 22 intersections and demonstrates superior performance in both real-world and simulated environments. Experimental results indicate that FuzzyLight enhances traffic efficiency by 48% compared to expert-designed timings in the real world. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in simulated environments using six real-world datasets with transmission noise.

| **[Network Traffic Classification Using Self-Supervised Learning and Confident Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23522v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network traffic classification (NTC) is vital for efficient network management, security, and performance optimization, particularly with 5G/6G technologies. Traditional methods, such as deep packet inspection (DPI) and port-based identification, struggle with the rise of encrypted traffic and dynamic port allocations. Supervised learning methods provide viable alternatives but rely on large labeled datasets, which are difficult to acquire given the diversity and volume of network traffic. Meanwhile, unsupervised learning methods, while less reliant on labeled data, often exhibit lower accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that first leverages Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) with techniques such as autoencoders or Tabular Contrastive Learning (TabCL) to generate pseudo-labels from extensive unlabeled datasets, addressing the challenge of limited labeled data. We then apply traffic-adopted Confident Learning (CL) to refine these pseudo-labels, enhancing classification precision by mitigating the impact of noise. Our proposed framework offers a generalizable solution that minimizes the need for extensive labeled data while delivering high accuracy. Extensive simulations and evaluations, conducted using three datasets (ISCX VPN-nonVPN, self-generated dataset, and UCDavis--QUIC), and demonstrate that our method achieves superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art techniques in classifying network traffic.</p></details> |  |

Using a setup that mimics the capabilities of a nosy neighbor in an adjacent flat, we analyze raw 802.11 packets and Bluetooth Low Energy advertisemets. From this data, we identify devices, infer their activity states and approximate their location using RSSI-based trilateration. Despite the encrypted nature of the data, we demonstrate that it is possible to detect active periods of multimedia devices, infer common activities such as sleeping, working and consuming media, and even approximate the layout of the neighbor's apartment. Our results show that privacy risks in smart homes extend beyond traditional data breaches: a nosy neighbor behind the wall can gain privacy-invasive insights into the lives of their neighbors purely from encrypted network traffic.</p></details> | <details><summary>80 pa...</summary><p>80 pages, 49 figures, bachelor thesis at the data privacy and security chair of the leipzig university</p></details> |

Existing methods to model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability across different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships directly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based hierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy inference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies through graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction approach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show that our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases, and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable, data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks.

| **[Understanding Generalization in Node and Link Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00927v3)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) for node and link prediction is crucial in various scientific and industrial domains, which has led to the development of diverse MPNN architectures. Besides working well in practical settings, their ability to generalize beyond the training set remains poorly understood. While some studies have explored MPNNs' generalization in graph-level prediction tasks, much less attention has been given to node- and link-level predictions. Existing works often rely on unrealistic i.i.d.\@ assumptions, overlooking possible correlations between nodes or links, and assuming fixed aggregation and impractical loss functions while neglecting the influence of graph structure. In this work, we introduce a unified framework to analyze the generalization properties of MPNNs in inductive and transductive node and link prediction settings, incorporating diverse architectural parameters and loss functions and quantifying the influence of graph structure. Additionally, our proposed generalization framework can be applied beyond graphs to any classification task under the inductive or transductive setting. Our empirical study supports our theoretical insights, deepening our understanding of MPNNs' generalization capabilities in these tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2412.07106</p></details> |
| **[UnifiedFL: A Dynamic Unified Learning Framework for Equitable Federation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26350v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative model training across multiple clients without sharing raw data, enabling privacy-preserving applications in areas such as radiology and pathology. However, works on collaborative training across clients with fundamentally different neural architectures and non-identically distributed datasets remain scarce. Existing FL frameworks face several limitations. Despite claiming to support architectural heterogeneity, most recent FL methods only tolerate variants within a single model family (e.g., shallower, deeper, or wider CNNs), still presuming a shared global architecture and failing to accommodate federations where clients deploy fundamentally different network types (e.g., CNNs, GNNs, MLPs). Moreover, existing approaches often address only statistical heterogeneity while overlooking the domain-fracture problem, where each client's data distribution differs markedly from that faced at testing time, undermining model generalizability. When clients use different architectures, have non-identically distributed data, and encounter distinct test domains, current methods perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose UnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous local networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a shared graph neural network (GNN). UnifiedFL introduces (i) a common GNN to parameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean distances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy balancing convergence and diversity. Experiments on MedMNIST classification and hippocampus segmentation benchmarks demonstrate UnifiedFL's superior performance. Code and data: https://github.com/basiralab/UnifiedFL</p></details> |  |
| **[From Embedding to Control: Representations for Stochastic Multi-Object Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26344v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies how to achieve accurate modeling and effective control in stochastic nonlinear dynamics with multiple interacting objects. However, non-uniform interactions and random topologies make this task challenging. We address these challenges by proposing \textit{Graph Controllable Embeddings} (GCE), a general framework to learn stochastic multi-object dynamics for linear control. Specifically, GCE is built on Hilbert space embeddings, allowing direct embedding of probability distributions of controlled stochastic dynamics into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), which enables linear operations in its RKHS while retaining nonlinear expressiveness. We provide theoretical guarantees on the existence, convergence, and applicability of GCE. Notably, a mean field approximation technique is adopted to efficiently capture inter-object dependencies and achieve provably low sample complexity. By integrating graph neural networks, we construct data-dependent kernel features that are capable of adapting to dynamic interaction patterns and generalizing to even unseen topologies with only limited training instances. GCE scales seamlessly to multi-object systems of varying sizes and topologies. Leveraging the linearity of Hilbert spaces, GCE also supports simple yet effective control algorithms for synthesizing optimal sequences. Experiments on physical systems, robotics, and power grids validate GCE and demonstrate consistent performance improvement over various competitive embedding methods in both in-distribution and few-shot tests</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks for Cybersecurity Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26307v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is a critical task in cybersecurity, where identifying insider threats, access violations, and coordinated attacks is essential for ensuring system resilience. Graph-based approaches have become increasingly important for modeling entity interactions, yet most rely on homogeneous and static structures, which limits their ability to capture the heterogeneity and temporal evolution of real-world environments. Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for anomaly detection by incorporating type-aware transformations and relation-sensitive aggregation, enabling more expressive modeling of complex cyber data. However, current research on HGNN-based anomaly detection remains fragmented, with diverse modeling strategies, limited comparative evaluation, and an absence of standardized benchmarks. To address this gap, we provide a comprehensive survey of HGNN-based anomaly detection methods in cybersecurity. We introduce a taxonomy that classifies approaches by anomaly type and graph dynamics, analyze representative models, and map them to key cybersecurity applications. We also review commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, highlighting their strengths and limitations. Finally, we identify key open challenges related to modeling, data, and deployment, and outline promising directions for future research. This survey aims to establish a structured foundation for advancing HGNN-based anomaly detection toward scalable, interpretable, and practically deployable solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 4 figures, 86 references.

| **[Morphology-Aware Graph Reinforcement Learning for Tensegrity Robot Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26067v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensegrity robots combine rigid rods and elastic cables, offering high resilience and deployability but posing major challenges for locomotion control due to their underactuated and highly coupled dynamics. This paper introduces a morphology-aware reinforcement learning framework that integrates a graph neural network (GNN) into the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. By representing the robot's physical topology as a graph, the proposed GNN-based policy captures coupling among components, enabling faster and more stable learning than conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) policies. The method is validated on a physical 3-bar tensegrity robot across three locomotion primitives, including straight-line tracking and bidirectional turning. It shows superior sample efficiency, robustness to noise and stiffness variations, and improved trajectory accuracy. Notably, the learned policies transfer directly from simulation to hardware without fine-tuning, achieving stable real-world locomotion. These results demonstrate the advantages of incorporating structural priors into reinforcement learning for tensegrity robot control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-driven Projection Generation for Efficiently Solving Heterogeneous Quadratic Programming Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26061v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a data-driven framework for efficiently solving quadratic programming (QP) problems by reducing the number of variables in high-dimensional QPs using instance-specific projection. A graph neural network-based model is designed to generate projections tailored to each QP instance, enabling us to produce high-quality solutions even for previously unseen problems. The model is trained on heterogeneous QPs to minimize the expected objective value evaluated on the projected solutions. This is formulated as a bilevel optimization problem; the inner optimization solves the QP under a given projection using a QP solver, while the outer optimization updates the model parameters. We develop an efficient algorithm to solve this bilevel optimization problem, which computes parameter gradients without backpropagating through the solver. We provide a theoretical analysis of the generalization ability of solving QPs with projection matrices generated by neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces high-quality feasible solutions with reduced computation time, outperforming existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Graph Networks for Accurate Weather Forecasting via Lightweight Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22094v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Climate events arise from intricate, multivariate dynamics governed by global-scale drivers, profoundly impacting food, energy, and infrastructure. Yet, accurate weather prediction remains elusive due to physical processes unfolding across diverse spatio-temporal scales, which fixed-resolution methods cannot capture. Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) offer a multiscale representation, but nonlinear downward mappings often erase global trends, weakening the integration of physics into forecasts. We introduce HiFlowCast and its ensemble variant HiAntFlow, HGNNs that embed physics within a multiscale prediction framework. Two innovations underpin their design: a Latent-Memory-Retention mechanism that preserves global trends during downward traversal, and a Latent-to-Physics branch that integrates PDE solution fields across diverse scales. Our Flow models cut errors by over 5% at 13-day lead times and by 5-8% under 1st and 99th quantile extremes, improving reliability for rare events. Leveraging pretrained model weights, they converge within a single epoch, reducing training cost and their carbon footprint. Such efficiency is vital as the growing scale of machine learning challenges sustainability and limits research accessibility. Code and model weights are in the supplementary materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust GNN Watermarking via Implicit Perception of Topological Invariants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25934v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are valuable intellectual property, yet many watermarks rely on backdoor triggers that break under common model edits and create ownership ambiguity. We present InvGNN-WM, which ties ownership to a model's implicit perception of a graph invariant, enabling trigger-free, black-box verification with negligible task impact. A lightweight head predicts normalized algebraic connectivity on an owner-private carrier set; a sign-sensitive decoder outputs bits, and a calibrated threshold controls the false-positive rate. Across diverse node and graph classification datasets and backbones, InvGNN-WM matches clean accuracy while yielding higher watermark accuracy than trigger- and compression-based baselines. It remains strong under unstructured pruning, fine-tuning, and post-training quantization; plain knowledge distillation (KD) weakens the mark, while KD with a watermark loss (KD+WM) restores it. We provide guarantees for imperceptibility and robustness, and we prove that exact removal is NP-complete.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Network-based Structural Simulator: Graph Neural Networks for Structural Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25683v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been explored as surrogate models for numerical simulations. While their applications in computational fluid dynamics have been investigated, little attention has been given to structural problems, especially for dynamic cases. To address this gap, we introduce the Graph Network-based Structural Simulator (GNSS), a GNN framework for surrogate modeling of dynamic structural problems. GNSS follows the encode-process-decode paradigm typical of GNN-based machine learning models, and its design makes it particularly suited for dynamic simulations thanks to three key features: (i) expressing node kinematics in node-fixed local frames, which avoids catastrophic cancellation in finite-difference velocities; (ii) employing a sign-aware regression loss, which reduces phase errors in long rollouts; and (iii) using a wavelength-informed connectivity radius, which optimizes graph construction. We evaluate GNSS on a case study involving a beam excited by a 50kHz Hanning-modulated pulse. The results show that GNSS accurately reproduces the physics of the problem over hundreds of timesteps and generalizes to unseen loading conditions, where existing GNNs fail to converge or deliver meaningful predictions. Compared with explicit finite element baselines, GNSS achieves substantial inference speedups while preserving spatial and temporal fidelity. These findings demonstrate that locality-preserving GNNs with physics-consistent update rules are a competitive alternative for dynamic, wave-dominated structural simulations.</p></details> | 16 pages, 14 figures |
| **[A method for the systematic generation of graph XAI benchmarks via Weisfeiler-Leman coloring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12437v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks have become the de facto model for learning from structured data. However, the decision-making process of GNNs remains opaque to the end user, which undermines their use in safety-critical applications. Several explainable AI techniques for graphs have been developed to address this major issue. Focusing on graph classification, these explainers identify subgraph motifs that explain predictions. Therefore, a robust benchmarking of graph explainers is required to ensure that the produced explanations are of high quality, i.e., aligned with the GNN's decision process. However, current graph-XAI benchmarks are limited to simplistic synthetic datasets or a few real-world tasks curated by domain experts, hindering rigorous and reproducible evaluation, and consequently stalling progress in the field. To overcome these limitations, we propose a method to automate the construction of graph XAI benchmarks from generic graph classification datasets. Our approach leverages the Weisfeiler-Leman color refinement algorithm to efficiently perform approximate subgraph matching and mine class-discriminating motifs, which serve as proxy ground-truth class explanations. At the same time, we ensure that these motifs can be learned by GNNs because their discriminating power aligns with WL expressiveness. This work also introduces the OpenGraphXAI benchmark suite, which consists of 15 ready-made graph-XAI datasets derived by applying our method to real-world molecular classification datasets. The suite is available to the public along with a codebase to generate over 2,000 additional graph-XAI benchmarks. Finally, we present a use case that illustrates how the suite can be used to assess the effectiveness of a selection of popular graph explainers, demonstrating the critical role of a sufficiently large benchmark collection for improving the significance of experimental results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring End-to-end Differentiable Neural Charged Particle Tracking -- A Loss Landscape Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13420v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Measurement and analysis of high energetic particles for scientific, medical or industrial applications is a complex procedure, requiring the design of sophisticated detector and data processing systems. The development of adaptive and differentiable software pipelines using a combination of conventional and machine learning algorithms is therefore getting ever more important to optimize and operate the system efficiently while maintaining end-to-end (E2E) differentiability. We propose for the application of charged particle tracking an E2E differentiable decision-focused learning scheme using graph neural networks with combinatorial components solving a linear assignment problem for each detector layer. We demonstrate empirically that including differentiable variations of discrete assignment operations allows for efficient network optimization, working better or on par with approaches that lack E2E differentiability. In additional studies, we dive deeper into the optimization process and provide further insights from a loss landscape perspective. We demonstrate that while both methods converge into similar performing, globally well-connected regions, they suffer under substantial predictive instability across initialization and optimization methods, which can have unpredictable consequences on the performance of downstream tasks such as image reconstruction. We also point out a dependency between the interpolation factor of the gradient estimator and the prediction stability of the model, suggesting the choice of sufficiently small values. Given the strong global connectivity of learned solutions and the excellent training performance, we argue that E2E differentiability provides, besides the general availability of gradient information, an important tool for robust particle tracking to mitigate prediction instabilities by favoring solutions that perform well on downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR), 2025</p></details> |

While local explanations offer insights into individual predictions, global explanation methods, those that characterize an entire class, remain underdeveloped. Existing global explainers rely on motif discovery in small graphs, an approach that breaks down in large, real-world settings where subgraph repetition is rare, node attributes are high-dimensional, and predictions arise from complex structure-attribute interactions. We propose GnnXemplar, a novel global explainer inspired from Exemplar Theory from cognitive science. GnnXemplar identifies representative nodes in the GNN embedding space, exemplars, and explains predictions using natural language rules derived from their neighborhoods. Exemplar selection is framed as a coverage maximization problem over reverse k-nearest neighbors, for which we provide an efficient greedy approximation. To derive interpretable rules, we employ a self-refining prompt strategy using large language models (LLMs). Experiments across diverse benchmarks show that GnnXemplar significantly outperforms existing methods in fidelity, scalability, and human interpretability, as validated by a user study with 60 participants.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 20 figures, NeurIPS 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

Most existing approaches often require long training times, large-capacity models, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. We introduce FastJAM, a rapid, graph-based method that drastically reduces the computational complexity of joint alignment tasks. FastJAM leverages pairwise matches computed by an off-the-shelf image matcher, together with a rapid nonparametric clustering, to construct a graph representing intra- and inter-image keypoint relations. A graph neural network propagates and aggregates these correspondences, efficiently predicting per-image homography parameters via image-level pooling. Utilizing an inverse-compositional loss, that eliminates the need for a regularization term over the predicted transformations (and thus also obviates the hyperparameter tuning associated with such terms), FastJAM performs image JA quickly and effectively. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that FastJAM achieves results better than existing modern JA methods in terms of alignment quality, while reducing computation time from hours or minutes to mere seconds.

Although spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved success in modeling various static spatio-temporal forecasting scenarios, real-world spatio-temporal data are typically received in a streaming manner, and the network continuously expands with the installation of new sensors. Thus, spatio-temporal forecasting in streaming scenarios faces dual challenges: the inefficiency of retraining models over newly arrived data and the detrimental effects of catastrophic forgetting over long-term history. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prompt tuning-based continuous forecasting method, following two fundamental tuning principles guided by empirical and theoretical analysis: expand and compress, which effectively resolve the aforementioned problems with lightweight tuning parameters. Specifically, we integrate the base spatio-temporal graph neural network with a continuous prompt pool, utilizing stored prompts (i.e., few learnable parameters) in memory, and jointly optimize them with the base spatio-temporal graph neural network. This method ensures that the model sequentially learns from the spatio-temporal data stream to accomplish tasks for corresponding periods. Extensive experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the multi-faceted superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art baselines, including effectiveness, efficiency, universality, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods like low-rank adaptations (LoRA) are efficient but lack flexibility, while Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) enhance model capacity at the cost of more & under-utilized parameters. To address these limitations, we propose Structural Mixture of Residual Experts (S'MoRE), a novel framework that seamlessly integrates the efficiency of LoRA with the flexibility of MoE. Conceptually, S'MoRE employs hierarchical low-rank decomposition of expert weights, yielding residuals of varying orders interconnected in a multi-layer structure. By routing input tokens through sub-trees of residuals, S'MoRE emulates the capacity of numerous experts by instantiating and assembling just a few low-rank matrices. We craft the inter-layer propagation of S'MoRE's residuals as a special type of Graph Neural Network (GNN), and prove that under similar parameter budget, S'MoRE improves structural flexibility of traditional MoE (or Mixture-of-LoRA) by exponential order. Comprehensive theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that S'MoRE achieves superior fine-tuning performance, offering a transformative approach for efficient LLM adaptation. Our implementation is available at: https://github.com/ZimpleX/SMoRE-LLM.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Many real-world graphs exceed the memory capacity of a GPU due to their sheer size, and training GNNs on such graphs requires techniques such as mini-batch sampling to scale. The alternative approach of distributed full-graph training suffers from high communication overheads and load imbalance due to the irregular structure of graphs. We propose a three-dimensional (3D) parallel approach for full-graph training that tackles these issues and scales to billion-edge graphs. In addition, we introduce optimizations such as a double permutation scheme for load balancing, and a performance model to predict the optimal 3D configuration of our parallel implementation -- Plexus. We evaluate Plexus on six different graph datasets and show scaling results on up to 2048 GPUs of Perlmutter, and 1024 GPUs of Frontier. Plexus achieves unprecedented speedups of 2.3-12.5x over prior state of the art, and a reduction in time-to-solution by 5.2-8.7x on Perlmutter and 7.0-54.2x on Frontier.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging the comprehensive UNSW-NB15 dataset containing diverse network traffic patterns, our approach effectively captures both spatial dependencies through graph structural relationships and temporal dynamics through sequential analysis of network events. The integrated attention mechanism provides dual benefits of improved model interpretability and enhanced feature selection, enabling cybersecurity analysts to focus computational resources on high-impact security events -- a critical requirement in modern real-time intrusion detection systems. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed hybrid model achieves superior performance compared to traditional machine learning approaches and standalone deep learning models across multiple evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model achieves particularly strong performance in detecting sophisticated attack patterns such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, and zero-day exploits, making it a promising solution for next-generation cybersecurity applications in complex network environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Fair Graph Representations with Multi-view Information Bottleneck](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25096v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel on relational data by passing messages over node features and structure, but they can amplify training data biases, propagating discriminatory attributes and structural imbalances into unfair outcomes. Many fairness methods treat bias as a single source, ignoring distinct attribute and structure effects and leading to suboptimal fairness and utility trade-offs. To overcome this challenge, we propose FairMIB, a multi-view information bottleneck framework designed to decompose graphs into feature, structural, and diffusion views for mitigating complexity biases in GNNs. Especially, the proposed FairMIB employs contrastive learning to maximize cross-view mutual information for bias-free representation learning. It further integrates multi-perspective conditional information bottleneck objectives to balance task utility and fairness by minimizing mutual information with sensitive attributes. Additionally, FairMIB introduces an inverse probability-weighted (IPW) adjacency correction in the diffusion view, which reduces the spread of bias propagation during message passing. Experiments on five real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairMIB achieves state-of-the-art performance across both utility and fairness metrics.</p></details> |  |

This work presents a novel approach toward high-energy molecules by combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for molecular generation and Attentive Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for property predictions. We propose a transformative embedding space construction strategy that integrates fixed SHA-256 embeddings with partially trainable representations. Unlike conventional regularization techniques, this changes the representational basis itself, reshaping the molecular input space before learning begins. Without recourse to pretraining, the generator achieves 67.5% validity and 37.5% novelty. The generated library exhibits a mean Tanimoto coefficient of 0.214 relative to training set signifying the ability of framework to generate a diverse chemical space. We identified 37 new super explosives higher than 9 km/s predicted detonation velocity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Network Assisted Genetic Algorithm for Structural Dynamic Response and Parameter Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22839v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The optimization of structural parameters, such as mass(m), stiffness(k), and damping coefficient(c), is critical for designing efficient, resilient, and stable structures. Conventional numerical approaches, including Finite Element Method (FEM) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, provide high-fidelity results but are computationally expensive for iterative optimization tasks, as each evaluation requires solving the governing equations for every parameter combination. This study proposes a hybrid data-driven framework that integrates a Graph Neural Network (GNN) surrogate model with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimizer to overcome these challenges. The GNN is trained to accurately learn the nonlinear mapping between structural parameters and dynamic displacement responses, enabling rapid predictions without repeatedly solving the system equations. A dataset of single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system responses is generated using the Newmark Beta method across diverse mass, stiffness, and damping configurations. The GA then searches for globally optimal parameter sets by minimizing predicted displacements and enhancing dynamic stability. Results demonstrate that the GNN and GA framework achieves strong convergence, robust generalization, and significantly reduced computational cost compared to conventional simulations. This approach highlights the effectiveness of combining machine learning surrogates with evolutionary optimization for automated and intelligent structural design.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |

Existing methods often rely on singular representations such as abstract syntax trees (ASTs), control flow graphs (CFGs), and data flow graphs (DFGs), which capture only partial aspects of code semantics. Hybrid approaches have emerged, but their fusion strategies are typically handcrafted and ineffective. In this study, we propose MAGNET, a multi-graph attentional framework that jointly leverages AST, CFG, and DFG representations to capture syntactic and semantic features of source code. MAGNET integrates residual graph neural networks with node-level self-attention to learn both local and long-range dependencies, introduces a gated cross-attention mechanism for fine-grained inter-graph interactions, and employs Set2Set pooling to fuse multi-graph embeddings into unified program-level representations. Extensive experiments on BigCloneBench and Google Code Jam demonstrate that MAGNET achieves state-of-the-art performance with an overall F1 score of 96.5\% and 99.2\% on the two datasets, respectively. Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of multi-graph fusion and each attentional component. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZixianReid/Multigraph_match</p></details> |  |
| **[The Logical Expressiveness of Temporal GNNs via Two-Dimensional Product Logics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11930v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the expressive power of various neural architectures -- including graph neural networks (GNNs), transformers, and recurrent neural networks -- has been characterised using tools from logic and formal language theory. As the capabilities of basic architectures are becoming well understood, increasing attention is turning to models that combine multiple architectural paradigms. Among them particularly important, and challenging to analyse, are temporal extensions of GNNs, which integrate both spatial (graph-structure) and temporal (evolution over time) dimensions. In this paper, we initiate the study of logical characterisation of temporal GNNs by connecting them to two-dimensional product logics. We show that the expressive power of temporal GNNs depends on how graph and temporal components are combined. In particular, temporal GNNs that apply static GNNs recursively over time can capture all properties definable in the product logic of (past) propositional temporal logic PTL and the modal logic K. In contrast, architectures such as graph-and-time TGNNs and global TGNNs can only express restricted fragments of this logic, where the interaction between temporal and spatial operators is syntactically constrained. These provide us with the first results on the logical expressiveness of temporal GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rademacher Meets Colors: More Expressivity, but at What Cost ?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10101v3)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) is typically understood through their correspondence with graph isomorphism tests such as the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. While more expressive GNNs can distinguish a richer set of graphs, they are also observed to suffer from higher generalization error. This work provides a theoretical explanation for this trade-off by linking expressivity and generalization through the lens of coloring algorithms. Specifically, we show that the number of equivalence classes induced by WL colorings directly bounds the GNNs Rademacher complexity -- a key data-dependent measure of generalization. Our analysis reveals that greater expressivity leads to higher complexity and thus weaker generalization guarantees. Furthermore, we prove that the Rademacher complexity is stable under perturbations in the color counts across different samples, ensuring robustness to sampling variability across datasets. Importantly, our framework is not restricted to message-passing GNNs or 1-WL, but extends to arbitrary GNN architectures and expressivity measures that partition graphs into equivalence classes. These results unify the study of expressivity and generalization in GNNs, providing a principled understanding of why increasing expressive power often comes at the cost of generalization.</p></details> |  |

We introduce FALCON, a unified machine learning framework that enables fully automated, specification-driven analog circuit synthesis through topology selection and layout-constrained optimization. Given a target performance, FALCON first selects an appropriate circuit topology using a performance-driven classifier guided by human design heuristics. Next, it employs a custom, edge-centric graph neural network trained to map circuit topology and parameters to performance, enabling gradient-based parameter inference through the learned forward model. This inference is guided by a differentiable layout cost, derived from analytical equations capturing parasitic and frequency-dependent effects, and constrained by design rules. We train and evaluate FALCON on a large-scale custom dataset of 1M analog mm-wave circuits, generated and simulated using Cadence Spectre across 20 expert-designed topologies. Through this evaluation, FALCON demonstrates >99% accuracy in topology inference, <10% relative error in performance prediction, and efficient layout-aware design that completes in under 1 second per instance. Together, these results position FALCON as a practical and extensible foundation model for end-to-end analog circuit design automation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

Building on the Bayesian decision-theoretic framework of Sablayrolles et al., we derive the Bayes-optimal membership inference rule for node-level MIAs against graph neural networks, addressing key open questions about optimal query strategies in the graph setting. We introduce BASE and G-BASE, tractable approximations of the Bayes-optimal membership inference. G-BASE achieves superior performance compared to previously proposed classifier-based node-level MIA attacks. BASE, which is also applicable to non-graph data, matches or exceeds the performance of prior state-of-the-art MIAs, such as LiRA and RMIA, at a significantly lower computational cost. Finally, we show that BASE and RMIA are equivalent under a specific hyperparameter setting, providing a principled, Bayes-optimal justification for the RMIA attack.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Ne...</summary><p>In NeurIPS 2025, 10 pages plus 15 pages of appendices</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Graph Neural Networks: A Mutual Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19223v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge distillation (KD) techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for transferring expertise from complex teacher models to lightweight student models, particularly beneficial for deploying high-performance models in resource-constrained devices. This approach has been successfully applied to graph neural networks (GNNs), harnessing their expressive capabilities to generate node embeddings that capture structural and feature-related information. In this study, we depart from the conventional KD approach by exploring the potential of collaborative learning among GNNs. In the absence of a pre-trained teacher model, we show that relatively simple and shallow GNN architectures can synergetically learn efficient models capable of performing better during inference, particularly in tackling multiple tasks. We propose a collaborative learning framework where ensembles of student GNNs mutually teach each other throughout the training process. We introduce an adaptive logit weighting unit to facilitate efficient knowledge exchange among models and an entropy enhancement technique to improve mutual learning. These components dynamically empower the models to adapt their learning strategies during training, optimizing their performance for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets each for node and graph classification demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, a wide range of solutions have been proposed for the specific case of systematic relational reasoning, including Neuro-Symbolic approaches, variants of the Transformer architecture, and specialised Graph Neural Networks. However, existing benchmarks for systematic relational reasoning focus on an overly simplified setting, based on the assumption that reasoning can be reduced to composing relational paths. In fact, this assumption is hard-baked into the architecture of several recent models, leading to approaches that can perform well on existing benchmarks but are difficult to generalise to other settings. To support further progress in the field of systematic relational reasoning with neural networks, we introduce NoRA, a new benchmark which adds several levels of difficulty and requires models to go beyond path-based reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at NeurIPS 2025 D&B track</p></details> |

This work presents iPac, a novel approach to introduce a new graph representation of images to enhance graph neural network image classification by recognizing the importance of underlying structure and relationships in medical image classification. iPac integrates various stages, including patch partitioning, feature extraction, clustering, graph construction, and graph-based learning, into a unified network to advance graph neural network image classification. By capturing relevant features and organising them into clusters, we construct a meaningful graph representation that effectively encapsulates the semantics of the image. Experimental evaluation on diverse medical image datasets demonstrates the efficacy of iPac, exhibiting an average accuracy improvement of up to 5% over baseline methods. Our approach offers a versatile and generic solution for image classification, particularly in the realm of medical images, by leveraging the graph representation and accounting for the inherent structure and relationships among visual entities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the proceedings of ICONIP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Dual Prompting: Hierarchical Debiasing for Fairness-aware Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23469v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) through self-supervised learning on unlabeled graph data has emerged as a widely adopted paradigm in graph learning. Although the paradigm is effective for pre-training powerful GNN models, the objective gap often exists between pre-training and downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, graph prompting adapts pre-trained GNN models to specific downstream tasks with extra learnable prompts while keeping the pre-trained GNN models frozen. As recent graph prompting methods largely focus on enhancing model utility on downstream tasks, they often overlook fairness concerns when designing prompts for adaptation. In fact, pre-trained GNN models will produce discriminative node representations across demographic subgroups, as downstream graph data inherently contains biases in both node attributes and graph structures. To address this issue, we propose an Adaptive Dual Prompting (ADPrompt) framework that enhances fairness for adapting pre-trained GNN models to downstream tasks. To mitigate attribute bias, we design an Adaptive Feature Rectification module that learns customized attribute prompts to suppress sensitive information at the input layer, reducing bias at the source. Afterward, we propose an Adaptive Message Calibration module that generates structure prompts at each layer, which adjust the message from neighboring nodes to enable dynamic and soft calibration of the information flow. Finally, ADPrompt jointly optimizes the two prompting modules to adapt the pre-trained GNN while enhancing fairness. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets with four pre-training strategies to evaluate the performance of ADPrompt. The results demonstrate that our proposed ADPrompt outperforms seven baseline methods on node classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a MetaModel framework to aggregate predictions from a diverse set of leading ML models. We present a featurisation scheme for combining task-specific GNN-derived features with conventional molecular descriptors. We demonstrate that our framework outperforms the cutting-edge ChemProp model on all regression datasets tested and 6 of 9 classification datasets. We further show that including the GNN features derived from ChemProp boosts the ensemble model's performance on several datasets where it otherwise would have underperformed. We conclude that to achieve optimal performance across a wide set of problems, it is vital to combine general-purpose descriptors with task-specific learned features and use a diverse set of ML models to make the predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[HOPSE: Scalable Higher-Order Positional and Structural Encoder for Combinatorial Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15405v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven highly effective at modeling relational data, pairwise connections cannot fully capture multi-way relationships naturally present in complex real-world systems. In response to this, Topological Deep Learning (TDL) leverages more general combinatorial representations -- such as simplicial or cellular complexes -- to accommodate higher-order interactions. Existing TDL methods often extend GNNs through Higher-Order Message Passing (HOMP), but face critical \emph{scalability challenges} due to \textit{(i)} a combinatorial explosion of message-passing routes, and \textit{(ii)} significant complexity overhead from the propagation mechanism. This work presents HOPSE (Higher-Order Positional and Structural Encoder), an alternative method to solve tasks involving higher-order interactions \emph{without message passing}. Instead, HOPSE breaks \emph{arbitrary higher-order domains} into their neighborhood relationships using a Hasse graph decomposition. This method shows that decoupling the representation learning of neighborhood topology from that of attributes results in lower computational complexity, casting doubt on the need for HOMP. The experiments on molecular graph tasks and topological benchmarks show that HOPSE matches performance on traditional TDL datasets and outperforms HOMP methods on topological tasks, achieving up to $7\times$ speedups over HOMP-based models, opening a new path for scalable TDL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Transformation Invariant Geometric Deep Learning: An Initial Representation Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12345v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks have achieved great success in the last decade. When designing neural networks to handle the ubiquitous geometric data such as point clouds and graphs, it is critical that the model can maintain invariance towards various transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling. Most existing graph neural network (GNN) approaches can only maintain permutation-invariance, failing to guarantee invariance with respect to other transformations. Besides GNNs, other works design sophisticated transformation-invariant layers, which are computationally expensive and difficult to be extended. In this paper, we revisit why general neural networks cannot maintain transformation invariance. Our findings show that transformation-invariant and distance-preserving initial point representations are sufficient to achieve transformation invariance rather than needing sophisticated neural layer designs. Motivated by these findings, we propose Transformation Invariant Neural Networks (TinvNN), a straightforward and general plug-in for geometric data. Specifically, we realize transformation invariant and distance-preserving initial point representations by modifying multi-dimensional scaling and feed the representations into existing neural networks. We prove that TinvNN can strictly guarantee transformation invariance, being general and flexible enough to be combined with the existing neural networks. Extensive experimental results on point cloud analysis and combinatorial optimization demonstrate the effectiveness and general applicability of our method. We also extend our method into equivariance cases. Based on the results, we advocate that TinvNN should be considered as an essential baseline for further studies of transformation-invariant geometric deep learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages; accepted by IEEE TPAMI</p></details> |

We investigate the underappreciated potential of vision models for graph understanding, finding they achieve performance comparable to GNNs on established benchmarks while exhibiting distinctly different learning patterns. These divergent behaviors, combined with limitations of existing benchmarks that conflate domain features with topological understanding, motivate our introduction of GraphAbstract. This benchmark evaluates models' ability to perceive global graph properties as humans do: recognizing organizational archetypes, detecting symmetry, sensing connectivity strength, and identifying critical elements. Our results reveal that vision models significantly outperform GNNs on tasks requiring holistic structural understanding and maintain generalizability across varying graph scales, while GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with increasing graph size. This work demonstrates that vision models possess remarkable yet underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding, particularly for problems requiring global topological awareness and scale-invariant reasoning. These findings open new avenues to leverage this underappreciated potential for developing more effective graph foundation models for tasks dominated by holistic pattern recognition.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Traditional machine translation methods often fail to capture query-specific contextual cues, leading to semantic ambiguities that negatively impact click-through rates (CTR) and conversion rates (CVR). To address this challenge, we propose AdGraphTrans, a novel dual-encoder framework enhanced with graph neural networks (GNNs) for context-aware query translation in advertising. Specifically, user queries and ad contents are independently encoded using multilingual Transformer-based encoders (mBERT/XLM-R), and contextual relations-such as co-clicked ads, user search sessions, and query-ad co-occurrence-are modeled as a heterogeneous graph. A graph attention network (GAT) is then applied to refine embeddings by leveraging semantic and behavioral context. These embeddings are aligned via contrastive learning to reduce translation ambiguity. Experiments conducted on a cross-lingual sponsored search dataset collected from Google Ads and Amazon Ads (EN-ZH, EN-ES, EN-FR pairs) demonstrate that AdGraphTrans significantly improves query translation quality, achieving a BLEU score of 38.9 and semantic similarity (cosine score) of 0.83, outperforming strong baselines such as mBERT and M2M-100. Moreover, in downstream ad retrieval tasks, AdGraphTrans yields +4.67% CTR and +1.72% CVR improvements over baseline methods. These results confirm that incorporating graph-based contextual signals with dual-encoder translation provides a robust solution for enhancing cross-lingual sponsored search in advertising platforms.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a hybrid framework that synergizes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with the Implicit Z-Bus Recursive (IZR) method, a robust, non-iterative solver for radial distribution networks. The framework employs a physics-informed GNN for rapid initial predictions and invokes the IZR solver as a failsafe for stressed cases identified by a two-stage trigger. A failure is defined as any solution with a maximum power mismatch exceeding 0.1 p.u., a significant operational deviation. On a challenging test set of 7,500 stressed scenarios for the IEEE 33-bus system, the GNN-only model failed on 13.11 % of cases. In contrast, the hybrid framework identified all potential failures, delegating them to the IZR solver to achieve a 0.00 % failure rate, empirically matching the 100 % success rate of the analytical solver on this specific test set. An expanded ablation study confirms that both physics-informed training and Z-bus sensitivity features are critical, collaboratively reducing the GNN's failure rate from 98.72 % (data-only) to 13.11 %. The hybrid approach demonstrates a pragmatic path to achieving the empirical reliability of an analytical solver while leveraging GNN speed, enabling a significant increase in the number of scenarios analyzable in near real-time.</p></details> |  |

Existing POI recommendation models, predominantly based on Graph Neural Networks and sequential models, have been extensively studied. However, these models face a fundamental limitation: they struggle to simultaneously capture the inherent hierarchical structure of spatial choices and the dynamics and irregular shifts of user-specific temporal contexts. To overcome this limitation, we propose GTR-Mamba, a novel framework for cross-manifold conditioning and routing. GTR-Mamba leverages the distinct advantages of different mathematical spaces for different tasks: it models the static, tree-like preference hierarchies in hyperbolic geometry, while routing the dynamic sequence updates to a novel Mamba layer in the computationally stable and efficient Euclidean tangent space. This process is coordinated by a cross-manifold channel that fuses spatio-temporal information to explicitly steer the State Space Model (SSM), enabling flexible adaptation to contextual changes. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR-Mamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in next POI recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables, submitted to ICDE 2026</p></details> |

We propose the Diffuse to Detect (DTD) framework, a novel approach that innovatively adapts diffusion models for anomaly detection, diverging from their conventional use in generative tasks with high inference time. By comparison, DTD employs a single-step diffusion process to predict noise patterns, enabling rapid and precise identification of anomalies without reconstruction errors. This approach is grounded in robust theoretical foundations that link noise prediction to the data distribution's score function, ensuring reliable deviation detection. By integrating Graph Neural Networks to model sensor relationships as dynamic graphs, DTD effectively captures spatial (inter-sensor) and temporal anomalies. Its two-branch architecture, with parametric neural network-based energy scoring for scalability and nonparametric statistical methods for interpretability, provides flexible trade-offs between computational efficiency and transparency. Extensive evaluations on UAV sensor data, multivariate time series, and images demonstrate DTD's superior performance over existing methods, underscoring its generality across diverse data modalities. This versatility, combined with its adaptability, positions DTD as a transformative solution for safety-critical applications, including industrial monitoring and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policies over Poses: Reinforcement Learning based Distributed Pose-Graph Optimization for Multi-Robot SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22740v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the distributed pose-graph optimization (PGO) problem, which is fundamental in accurate trajectory estimation in multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Conventional iterative approaches linearize a highly non-convex optimization objective, requiring repeated solving of normal equations, which often converge to local minima and thus produce suboptimal estimates. We propose a scalable, outlier-robust distributed planar PGO framework using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). We cast distributed PGO as a partially observable Markov game defined on local pose-graphs, where each action refines a single edge's pose estimate. A graph partitioner decomposes the global pose graph, and each robot runs a recurrent edge-conditioned Graph Neural Network (GNN) encoder with adaptive edge-gating to denoise noisy edges. Robots sequentially refine poses through a hybrid policy that utilizes prior action memory and graph embeddings. After local graph correction, a consensus scheme reconciles inter-robot disagreements to produce a globally consistent estimate. Our extensive evaluations on a comprehensive suite of synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our learned MARL-based actors reduce the global objective by an average of 37.5% more than the state-of-the-art distributed PGO framework, while enhancing inference efficiency by at least 6X. We also demonstrate that actor replication allows a single learned policy to scale effortlessly to substantially larger robot teams without any retraining.

For large-scale HSIs, most methods rely on superpixel segmentation and perform superpixel-level clustering based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, existing GNNs cannot fully exploit the spectral information of the input HSI, and the inaccurate superpixel topological graph may lead to the confusion of different class semantics during information aggregation. To address these challenges, we first propose a structural-spectral graph convolutional operator (SSGCO) tailored for graph-structured HSI superpixels to improve their representation quality through the co-extraction of spatial and spectral features. Second, we propose an evidence-guided adaptive edge learning (EGAEL) module that adaptively predicts and refines edge weights in the superpixel topological graph. We integrate the proposed method into a contrastive learning framework to achieve clustering, where representation learning and clustering are simultaneously conducted. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves clustering accuracy by 2.61%, 6.06%, 4.96% and 3.15% over the best compared methods on four HSI datasets.

While prevailing defense strategies focus primarily on pre-processing techniques and adaptive message-passing schemes, this study delves into an under-explored dimension: the impact of weight initialization and associated hyper-parameters, such as training epochs, on a model's robustness. We introduce a theoretical framework bridging the connection between initialization strategies and a network's resilience to adversarial perturbations. Our analysis reveals a direct relationship between initial weights, number of training epochs and the model's vulnerability, offering new insights into adversarial robustness beyond conventional defense mechanisms. While our primary focus is on GNNs, we extend our theoretical framework, providing a general upper-bound applicable to Deep Neural Networks. Extensive experiments, spanning diverse models and real-world datasets subjected to various adversarial attacks, validate our findings. We illustrate that selecting appropriate initialization not only ensures performance on clean datasets but also enhances model robustness against adversarial perturbations, with observed gaps of up to 50\% compared to alternative initialization approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Graph Classification Robustness with Singular Pooling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22643v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved strong performance across a range of graph representation learning tasks, yet their adversarial robustness in graph classification remains underexplored compared to node classification. While most existing defenses focus on the message-passing component, this work investigates the overlooked role of pooling operations in shaping robustness. We present a theoretical analysis of standard flat pooling methods (sum, average and max), deriving upper bounds on their adversarial risk and identifying their vulnerabilities under different attack scenarios and graph structures. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textit{Robust Singular Pooling (RS-Pool)}, a novel pooling strategy that leverages the dominant singular vector of the node embedding matrix to construct a robust graph-level representation. We theoretically investigate the robustness of RS-Pool and interpret the resulting bound leading to improved understanding of our proposed pooling operator. While our analysis centers on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), RS-Pool is model-agnostic and can be implemented efficiently via power iteration. Empirical results on real-world benchmarks show that RS-Pool provides better robustness than the considered pooling methods when subject to state-of-the-art adversarial attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

| **[On Vanishing Gradients, Over-Smoothing, and Over-Squashing in GNNs: Bridging Recurrent and Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10818v2)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are models that leverage the graph structure to transmit information between nodes, typically through the message-passing operation. While widely successful, this approach is well known to suffer from the over-smoothing and over-squashing phenomena, which result in representational collapse as the number of layers increases and insensitivity to the information contained at distant and poorly connected nodes, respectively. In this paper, we present a unified view of these problems through the lens of vanishing gradients, using ideas from linear control theory for our analysis. We propose an interpretation of GNNs as recurrent models and empirically demonstrate that a simple state-space formulation of a GNN effectively alleviates over-smoothing and over-squashing at no extra trainable parameter cost. Further, we show theoretically and empirically that (i) GNNs are by design prone to extreme gradient vanishing even after a few layers; (ii) Over-smoothing is directly related to the mechanism causing vanishing gradients; (iii) Over-squashing is most easily alleviated by a combination of graph rewiring and vanishing gradient mitigation. We believe our work will help bridge the gap between the recurrent and graph neural network literature and will unlock the design of new deep and performant GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Paradigm Graph Backdoor Attacks with Promptable Subgraph Triggers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22555v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries implant malicious triggers to manipulate model predictions. Existing trigger generators are often simplistic in structure and overly reliant on specific features, confining them to a single graph learning paradigm, such as graph supervised learning, graph contrastive learning, or graph prompt learning. This specialized design, which aligns the trigger with one learning objective, results in poor transferability when applied to other learning paradigms. For instance, triggers generated for the graph supervised learning paradigm perform poorly when tested within graph contrastive learning or graph prompt learning environments. Furthermore, these simple generators often fail to utilize complex structural information or node diversity within the graph data. These constraints limit the attack success rates of such methods in general testing scenarios. Therefore, to address these limitations, we propose Cross-Paradigm Graph Backdoor Attacks with Promptable Subgraph Triggers(CP-GBA), a new transferable graph backdoor attack that employs graph prompt learning(GPL) to train a set of universal subgraph triggers. First, we distill a compact yet expressive trigger set from target graphs, which is structured as a queryable repository, by jointly enforcing class-awareness, feature richness, and structural fidelity. Second, we conduct the first exploration of the theoretical transferability of GPL to train these triggers under prompt-based objectives, enabling effective generalization to diverse and unseen test-time paradigms. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world datasets and defense scenarios show that CP-GBA achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Iteratively Refined Early Interaction Alignment for Subgraph Matching based Graph Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22538v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph retrieval based on subgraph isomorphism has several real-world applications such as scene graph retrieval, molecular fingerprint detection and circuit design. Roy et al. [35] proposed IsoNet, a late interaction model for subgraph matching, which first computes the node and edge embeddings of each graph independently of paired graph and then computes a trainable alignment map. Here, we present IsoNet++, an early interaction graph neural network (GNN), based on several technical innovations. First, we compute embeddings of all nodes by passing messages within and across the two input graphs, guided by an injective alignment between their nodes. Second, we update this alignment in a lazy fashion over multiple rounds. Within each round, we run a layerwise GNN from scratch, based on the current state of the alignment. After the completion of one round of GNN, we use the last-layer embeddings to update the alignments, and proceed to the next round. Third, IsoNet++ incorporates a novel notion of node-pair partner interaction. Traditional early interaction computes attention between a node and its potential partners in the other graph, the attention then controlling messages passed across graphs. In contrast, we consider node pairs (not single nodes) as potential partners. Existence of an edge between the nodes in one graph and non-existence in the other provide vital signals for refining the alignment. Our experiments on several datasets show that the alignments get progressively refined with successive rounds, resulting in significantly better retrieval performance than existing methods. We demonstrate that all three innovations contribute to the enhanced accuracy. Our code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/structlearning/isonetpp.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Architecture Search with GPT-4](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01436v3)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Architecture Search (GNAS) has shown promising results in finding the best graph neural network architecture on a given graph dataset. However, existing GNAS methods still require intensive human labor and rich domain knowledge when designing the search space and search strategy. To this end, we integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into GNAS and present a new GNAS model based on LLMs (GNAS-LLM for short). The basic idea of GNAS-LLM is to design a new class of GNAS prompts for LLMs to guide LLMs towards understanding the generative task of graph neural architectures. The prompts consist of descriptions of the search space, search strategy, and search feedback of GNAS. By iteratively running LLMs with the prompts, GNAS-LLM generates more accurate graph neural network architectures with fast convergence. Experimental results show that GNAS-LLM outperforms the state-of-the-art GNAS methods on four benchmark graph datasets, with an average improvement of 0.7% on the validation sets and 0.3% on the test sets. Besides, GNAS-LLM achieves an average improvement of 1.0% on the test sets based on the search space from AutoGEL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Robust Signed Graph Learning through Joint Input-Target Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22513v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) are widely adopted to analyze complex patterns in signed graphs with both positive and negative links. Given the noisy nature of real-world connections, the robustness of SGNN has also emerged as a pivotal research area. Under the supervision of empirical properties, graph structure learning has shown its robustness on signed graph representation learning, however, there remains a paucity of research investigating a robust SGNN with theoretical guidance. Inspired by the success of graph information bottleneck (GIB) in information extraction, we propose RIDGE, a novel framework for Robust sI gned graph learning through joint Denoising of Graph inputs and supervision targEts. Different from the basic GIB, we extend the GIB theory with the capability of target space denoising as the co-existence of noise in both input and target spaces. In instantiation, RIDGE effectively cleanses input data and supervision targets via a tractable objective function produced by reparameterization mechanism and variational approximation. We extensively validate our method on four prevalent signed graph datasets, and the results show that RIDGE clearly improves the robustness of popular SGNN models under various levels of noise.</p></details> | ACM MM 2025 |

As a common pattern to train powerful GNNs, the "pre-training, adaptation" scheme first pre-trains GNNs over unlabeled graph data and subsequently adapts them to specific downstream tasks. In the adaptation phase, graph prompting is an effective strategy that modifies input graph data with learnable prompts while keeping pre-trained GNN models frozen. Typically, existing graph prompting studies mainly focus on *feature-oriented* methods that apply graph prompts to node features or hidden representations. However, these studies often achieve suboptimal performance, as they consistently overlook the potential of *topology-oriented* prompting, which adapts pre-trained GNNs by modifying the graph topology. In this study, we conduct a pioneering investigation of graph prompting in terms of graph topology. We propose the first **Graph** **T**opology-**O**riented **P**rompting (GraphTOP) framework to effectively adapt pre-trained GNN models for downstream tasks. More specifically, we reformulate topology-oriented prompting as an edge rewiring problem within multi-hop local subgraphs and relax it into the continuous probability space through reparameterization while ensuring tight relaxation and preserving graph sparsity. Extensive experiments on five graph datasets under four pre-training strategies demonstrate that our proposed GraphTOP outshines six baselines on multiple node classification datasets.

In this study, we propose a graph-based neural inference model that simultaneously predicts neural activity and infers latent connectivity by modeling neurons as interacting nodes in a graph. The architecture features two distinct modules: one for learning structural connectivity and another for predicting future spiking activity via a graph neural network (GNN). Our model accommodates unobserved neurons through auxiliary nodes, allowing for inference in partially observed circuits. We evaluate this approach using synthetic data generated from ring attractor network models and real spike recordings from head direction cells in mice. Across a wide range of conditions, including varying recurrent connectivity, external inputs, and incomplete observations, our model reliably resolves spurious correlations and recovers accurate weight profiles. When applied to real data, the inferred connectivity aligns with theoretical predictions of continuous attractor models. These results highlight the potential of GNN-based models to infer latent neural circuitry through self-supervised structure learning, while leveraging the spike prediction task to flexibly link connectivity and dynamics across both simulated and biological neural systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[E2Former: An Efficient and Equivariant Transformer with Linear-Scaling Tensor Products](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19216v3)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) have demonstrated significant success in modeling microscale systems, including those in chemistry, biology and materials science. However, EGNNs face substantial computational challenges due to the high cost of constructing edge features via spherical tensor products, making them impractical for large-scale systems. To address this limitation, we introduce E2Former, an equivariant and efficient transformer architecture that incorporates the Wigner $6j$ convolution (Wigner $6j$ Conv). By shifting the computational burden from edges to nodes, the Wigner $6j$ Conv reduces the complexity from $O(|\mathcal{E}|)$ to $ O(| \mathcal{V}|)$ while preserving both the model's expressive power and rotational equivariance. We show that this approach achieves a 7x-30x speedup compared to conventional $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ convolutions. Furthermore, our empirical results demonstrate that the derived E2Former mitigates the computational challenges of existing approaches without compromising the ability to capture detailed geometric information. This development could suggest a promising direction for scalable and efficient molecular modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Censoring chemical data to mitigate dual use risk](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10510v2)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models have dual-use potential, potentially serving both beneficial and malicious purposes. The development of open-source models in chemistry has specifically surfaced dual-use concerns around toxicological data and chemical warfare agents. We discuss a chain risk framework identifying three misuse pathways and corresponding mitigation strategies: inference-level, model-level, and data-level. At the data level, we introduce a model-agnostic noising method to increase prediction error in specific desired regions (sensitive regions). Our results show that selective noise induces variance and attenuation bias, whereas simply omitting sensitive data fails to prevent extrapolation. These findings hold for both molecular feature multilayer perceptrons and graph neural networks. Thus, noising molecular structures can enable open sharing of potential dual-use molecular data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Augmentation: Leveraging Inter-Instance Relation in Self-Supervised Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22322v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates graph theory into self-supervised representation learning. Traditional methods focus on intra-instance variations generated by applying augmentations. However, they often overlook important inter-instance relationships. While our method retains the intra-instance property, it further captures inter-instance relationships by constructing k-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs for both teacher and student streams during pretraining. In these graphs, nodes represent samples along with their latent representations. Edges encode the similarity between instances. Following pretraining, a representation refinement phase is performed. In this phase, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate messages not only among immediate neighbors but also across multiple hops, thereby enabling broader contextual integration. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K demonstrate accuracy improvements of 7.3%, 3.2%, and 1.0%, respectively, over state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed graph based mechanism.

| **[Leveraging Teleconnections with Physics-Informed Graph Attention Networks for Long-Range Extreme Rainfall Forecasting in Thailand](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12328v4)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate rainfall forecasting, particularly for extreme events, remains a significant challenge in climatology and the Earth system. This paper presents novel physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combined with extreme-value analysis techniques to improve gauge-station rainfall predictions across Thailand. The model leverages a graph-structured representation of gauge stations to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and it offers explainability through teleconnections. We preprocess relevant climate indices that potentially influence regional rainfall. The proposed Graph Attention Network with Long Short-Term Memory (Attention-LSTM) applies the attention mechanism using initial edge features derived from simple orographic-precipitation physics formulation. The embeddings are subsequently processed by LSTM layers. To address extremes, we perform Peak-Over-Threshold (POT) mapping using the novel Spatial Season-aware Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) method, which overcomes limitations of traditional machine-learning models. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms well-established baselines across most regions, including areas prone to extremes, and remains strongly competitive with the state of the art. Compared with the operational forecasting system SEAS5, our real-world application improves extreme-event prediction and offers a practical enhancement to produce high-resolution maps that support decision-making in long-term water management.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Graph Neural Network for Data-Driven Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22096v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling plays a critical role in drug development by predicting drug concentration dynamics across organs. Traditional approaches rely on ordinary differential equations with strong simplifying assumptions, which limit their adaptability to nonlinear physiological interactions. In this study, we explore data-driven alternatives for PBPK prediction using deep learning. Two baseline architectures - a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network - are implemented to capture molecular and temporal dependencies, respectively. To incorporate inter-organ interactions, we propose a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (Dynamic GNN) that models physiological connections as recurrent message-passing processes between organs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Dynamic GNN achieves the highest predictive performance among all models, with an R^2 of 0.9342, an RMSE of 0.0159, and an MAE of 0.0116. In comparison, the MLP baseline obtains an R^2 of 0.8705 and the LSTM achieves 0.8059. These results highlight that explicitly modeling the spatial and temporal dependencies of organ interactions enables more accurate and generalizable drug concentration prediction. The Dynamic GNN provides a scalable, equation-free alternative to traditional PBPK formulations and demonstrates strong potential for data-driven pharmacokinetic modeling in preclinical and clinical research.</p></details> |  |

Neural network compression methods are used to reduce the model size while maintaining reasonable accuracy. Two of the common neural network compression techniques include pruning and quantization. In this research, we empirically examine the effects of three pruning methods and three quantization methods on different GNN models, including graph classification tasks, node classification tasks, and link prediction. We conducted all experiments on three graph datasets, including Cora, Proteins, and BBBP. Our findings demonstrate that unstructured fine-grained and global pruning can significantly reduce the model's size(50\%) while maintaining or even improving precision after fine-tuning the pruned model. The evaluation of different quantization methods on GNN shows diverse impacts on accuracy, inference time, and model size across different datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid GNN-LSE Method for Fast, Robust, and Physically-Consistent AC Power Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22020v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional AC Power Flow (ACPF) solvers like Newton-Raphson (NR) face significant computational and convergence challenges in modern, large-scale power systems. This paper proposes a novel, two-stage hybrid method that integrates a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a robust, iterative Linear State Estimation (LSE) refinement step to produce fast and physically-consistent solutions. The GNN, trained with a physics-informed loss function featuring an efficient dynamic weighting scheme, rapidly predicts a high-quality initial system state. This prediction is then refined using an iterative, direct linear solver inspired by state estimation techniques. This LSE refinement step solves a series of linear equations to enforce physical laws, effectively bypassing the non-linearities and convergence issues of traditional solvers. The proposed GNN-LSE framework is comprehensively validated on systems ranging from small radial distribution networks (IEEE 33-bus, 69-bus) to a large, meshed transmission system (IEEE 118-bus). Results show that our GNN variants are up to $8.4 \times 10^3$ times faster than NR. The LSE refinement provides a fast route to a physically-consistent solution, while heavy-loading stress tests (120%-150% of nominal) and N-1 contingencies demonstrate the method's reliability and generalization. This work presents a powerful and flexible framework for bridging fast, data-driven models with the rigorous constraints of power system physics, offering a practical tool for real-time operations and analysis.</p></details> |  |

DPEB is a curated collection of 22,043 human proteins that integrates four embedding types: structural (AlphaFold2), transformer-based sequence (BioEmbeddings), contextual amino acid patterns (ESM-2: Evolutionary Scale Modeling), and sequence-based n-gram statistics (ProtVec]). AlphaFold2 protein structures are available through public databases (e.g., AlphaFold2 Protein Structure Database), but the internal neural network embeddings are not. DPEB addresses this gap by providing AlphaFold2-derived embeddings for computational modeling. Our benchmark evaluations show GraphSAGE with BioEmbedding achieved the highest PPI prediction performance (87.37% AUROC, 79.16% accuracy). The framework also achieved 77.42% accuracy for enzyme classification and 86.04% accuracy for protein family classification.

We explore whether pretraining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on classical algorithms can improve their performance on molecular property prediction tasks from the Open Graph Benchmark: ogbg-molhiv (HIV inhibition) and ogbg-molclintox (clinical toxicity). GNNs trained on 24 classical algorithms from the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark are used to initialise and freeze selected layers of a second GNN for molecular prediction. Compared to a randomly initialised baseline, the pretrained models achieve consistent wins or ties, with the Segments Intersect algorithm pretraining yielding a 6% absolute gain on ogbg-molhiv and Dijkstra pretraining achieving a 3% gain on ogbg-molclintox. These results demonstrate embedding classical algorithmic priors into GNNs provides useful inductive biases, boosting performance on complex, real-world graph data.</p></details> |  |

A critical challenge in deploying these models is their reliance on sample likelihood computations, which scale prohibitively with system size $n$, often rendering them infeasible for large-scale problems. To address this, we introduce $\textit{HollowFlow}$, a flow-based generative model leveraging a novel non-backtracking graph neural network (NoBGNN). By enforcing a block-diagonal Jacobian structure, HollowFlow likelihoods are evaluated with a constant number of backward passes in $n$, yielding speed-ups of up to $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$: a significant step towards scaling BGs to larger systems. Crucially, our framework generalizes: $\textbf{any equivariant GNN or attention-based architecture}$ can be adapted into a NoBGNN. We validate HollowFlow by training BGs on two different systems of increasing size. For both systems, the sampling and likelihood evaluation time decreases dramatically, following our theoretical scaling laws. For the larger system we obtain a $10^2\times$ speed-up, clearly illustrating the potential of HollowFlow-based approaches for high-dimensional scientific problems previously hindered by computational bottlenecks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

The objective is to find a set of experts that maximizes coverage of the required skills while simultaneously minimizing the costs associated with the experts. Different definitions of cost have traditionally led to distinct problem formulations and algorithmic solutions. We introduce the unified TeamFormation formulation that captures all cost definitions for team formation problems that balance task coverage and expert cost. Specifically, we formulate three TeamFormation variants with different cost functions using quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), and we evaluate two distinct general-purpose solution methods. We show that solutions based on the QUBO formulations of TeamFormation problems are at least as good as those produced by established baselines. Furthermore, we show that QUBO-based solutions leveraging graph neural networks can effectively learn representations of experts and skills to enable transfer learning, allowing node embeddings from one problem instance to be efficiently applied to another.</p></details> |  |

MAGNET serves as a comprehensive solution for training a variety of GNN models, integrating deep learning and other advanced algorithms such as METIS and k-means to facilitate mesh agglomeration and quality metric computation. The library's introduction is outlined through its code structure and primary features. The GNN framework adopts a graph bisection methodology that capitalizes on connectivity and geometric mesh information via SAGE convolutional layers, in line with the methodology proposed by Antonietti et al. (2024). Additionally, the proposed MAGNET library incorporates reinforcement learning to enhance the accuracy and robustness of the model for predicting coarse partitions within a multilevel framework. A detailed tutorial is provided to guide the user through the process of mesh agglomeration and the training of a GNN bisection model. We present several examples of mesh agglomeration conducted by MAGNET, demonstrating the library's applicability across various scenarios. Furthermore, the performance of the newly introduced models is contrasted with that of METIS and k-means, illustrating that the proposed GNN models are competitive regarding partition quality and computational efficiency. Finally, we exhibit the versatility of MAGNET's interface through its integration with Lymph, an open-source library implementing discontinuous Galerkin methods on polytopal grids for the numerical discretization of multiphysics differential problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimating Treatment Effects in Networks using Domain Adversarial Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21457v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in network settings is complicated by interference, meaning that the outcome of an instance can be influenced by the treatment status of others. Existing causal machine learning approaches usually assume a known exposure mapping that summarizes how the outcome of a given instance is influenced by others' treatment, a simplification that is often unrealistic. Furthermore, the interaction between homophily -- the tendency of similar instances to connect -- and the treatment assignment mechanism can induce a network-level covariate shift that may lead to inaccurate treatment effect estimates, a phenomenon that has not yet been explicitly studied. To address these challenges, we propose HINet, a novel method that integrates graph neural networks with domain adversarial training. This combination allows estimating treatment effects under unknown exposure mappings while mitigating the impact of (network-level) covariate shift. An extensive empirical evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pilot Contamination-Aware Graph Attention Network for Power Control in CFmMIMO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00967v3)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization-based power control algorithms are predominantly iterative with high computational complexity, making them impractical for real-time applications in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) systems. Learning-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative, and among them, graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their excellent performance in solving power control problems. However, all existing GNN-based approaches assume ideal orthogonality among pilot sequences for user equipments (UEs), which is unrealistic given that the number of UEs exceeds the available orthogonal pilot sequences in CFmMIMO schemes. Moreover, most learning-based methods assume a fixed number of UEs, whereas the number of active UEs varies over time in practice. Additionally, supervised training necessitates costly computational resources for computing the target power control solutions for a large volume of training samples. To address these issues, we propose a graph attention network for downlink power control in CFmMIMO systems that operates in a self-supervised manner while effectively handling pilot contamination and adapting to a dynamic number of UEs. Experimental results show its effectiveness, even in comparison to the optimal accelerated projected gradient method as a baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Local Limits of Sparse Random Graphs: Color Convergence and the Refined Configuration Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21392v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Local convergence has emerged as a fundamental tool for analyzing sparse random graph models. We introduce a new notion of local convergence, color convergence, based on the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm. Color convergence fully characterizes the class of random graphs that are well-behaved in the limit for message-passing graph neural networks. Building on this, we propose the Refined Configuration Model (RCM), a random graph model that generalizes the configuration model. The RCM is universal with respect to local convergence among locally tree-like random graph models, including Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, stochastic block and configuration models. Finally, this framework enables a complete characterization of the random trees that arise as local limits of such graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Axial Neural Networks for Dimension-Free Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13665v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of foundation models in AI has significantly advanced general-purpose learning, enabling remarkable capabilities in zero-shot inference and in-context learning. However, training such models on physics data, including solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), poses a unique challenge due to varying dimensionalities across different systems. Traditional approaches either fix a maximum dimension or employ separate encoders for different dimensionalities, resulting in inefficiencies. To address this, we propose a dimension-agnostic neural network architecture, the Axial Neural Network (XNN), inspired by parameter-sharing structures such as Deep Sets and Graph Neural Networks. XNN generalizes across varying tensor dimensions while maintaining computational efficiency. We convert existing PDE foundation models into axial neural networks and evaluate their performance across three training scenarios: training from scratch, pretraining on multiple PDEs, and fine-tuning on a single PDE. Our experiments show that XNNs perform competitively with original models and exhibit superior generalization to unseen dimensions, highlighting the importance of multidimensional pretraining for foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Making Classic GNNs Strong Baselines Across Varying Homophily: A Smoothness-Generalization Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09805v3)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success but are often considered to be challenged by varying levels of homophily in graphs. Recent \textit{empirical} studies have surprisingly shown that homophilic GNNs can perform well across datasets of different homophily levels with proper hyperparameter tuning, but the underlying theory and effective architectures remain unclear. To advance GNN universality across varying homophily, we theoretically revisit GNN message passing and uncover a novel \textit{smoothness-generalization dilemma}, where increasing hops inevitably enhances smoothness at the cost of generalization. This dilemma hinders learning in high-order homophilic neighborhoods and all heterophilic ones, where generalization is critical due to complex neighborhood class distributions that are sensitive to shifts induced by noise or sparsity. To address this, we introduce the Inceptive Graph Neural Network (IGNN) built on three simple yet effective design principles, which alleviate the dilemma by enabling distinct hop-wise generalization alongside improved overall generalization with adaptive smoothness. Benchmarking against 30 baselines demonstrates IGNN's superiority and reveals notable universality in certain homophilic GNN variants. Our code and datasets are available at \href{https://github.com/galogm/IGNN}{https://github.com/galogm/IGNN}.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages.

Recently, learning-to-optimize methods (L2O) for linear (LPs) or quadratic programs (QPs) using message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) have gained traction, promising lightweight, data-driven proxies for solving such optimization problems. For example, they replace the costly computation of strong branching scores in branch-and-bound solvers, thereby reducing the need to solve many such optimization problems. However, robust L2O MPNNs remain challenging in data-scarce settings, especially when addressing complex optimization problems such as QPs. This work introduces a principled approach to data augmentation tailored for QPs via MPNNs. Our method leverages theoretically justified data augmentation techniques to generate diverse yet optimality-preserving instances. Furthermore, we integrate these augmentations into a self-supervised contrastive learning framework, thereby pretraining MPNNs for improved performance on L2O tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves generalization in supervised scenarios and facilitates effective transfer learning to related optimization problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 as spotlight</p></details> |

While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) offers a promising pathway to adaptability, existing graph MoE methods remain constrained by their reliance on supervised signals and instability when training heterogeneous experts. We introduce ADaMoRE (Adaptive Mixture of Residual Experts), a principled framework that enables robust, fully unsupervised training of heterogeneous MoE on graphs. ADaMoRE employs a backbone-residual expert architecture where foundational encoders provide stability while specialized residual experts capture diverse computational patterns. A structurally-aware gating network performs fine-grained node routing. The entire architecture is trained end-to-end using a unified unsupervised objective, which integrates a primary reconstruction task with an information-theoretic diversity regularizer to explicitly enforce functional specialization among the experts. Theoretical analysis confirms our design improves data efficiency and training stability. Extensive evaluation across 16 benchmarks validates ADaMoRE's state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised node classification and few-shot learning, alongside superior generalization, training efficiency, and faster convergence on diverse graphs and tasks.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a new graph representation that explicitly captures action information and propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture augmented with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to learn action rankings. Unlike value-function based approaches that must learn a globally consistent function, our action ranking method only needs to learn locally consistent ranking. Our model is trained on data generated from small problem instances that are easily solved by planners and is applied to significantly larger instances where planning is computationally prohibitive. Experimental results across standard planning benchmarks demonstrate that our action-ranking approach not only achieves better generalization to larger problems than those used in training but also outperforms multiple baselines (value function and action ranking) methods in terms of success rate and plan quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated with more results</p></details> |

Consequently, dimension-independent architectures have been proposed for domains where the inputs are graphs, sets, and point clouds. Recent work on graph neural networks has explored whether a model trained on low-dimensional data can transfer its performance to higher-dimensional inputs. We extend this body of work by introducing a general framework for transferability across dimensions. We show that transferability corresponds precisely to continuity in a limit space formed by identifying small problem instances with equivalent large ones. This identification is driven by the data and the learning task. We instantiate our framework on existing architectures, and implement the necessary changes to ensure their transferability. Finally, we provide design principles for designing new transferable models. Numerical experiments support our findings.</p></details> | 75 pages, 10 figures |
| **[TopoFR: A Closer Look at Topology Alignment on Face Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10587v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of face recognition (FR) has undergone significant advancements with the rise of deep learning. Recently, the success of unsupervised learning and graph neural networks has demonstrated the effectiveness of data structure information. Considering that the FR task can leverage large-scale training data, which intrinsically contains significant structure information, we aim to investigate how to encode such critical structure information into the latent space. As revealed from our observations, directly aligning the structure information between the input and latent spaces inevitably suffers from an overfitting problem, leading to a structure collapse phenomenon in the latent space. To address this problem, we propose TopoFR, a novel FR model that leverages a topological structure alignment strategy called PTSA and a hard sample mining strategy named SDE. Concretely, PTSA uses persistent homology to align the topological structures of the input and latent spaces, effectively preserving the structure information and improving the generalization performance of FR model. To mitigate the impact of hard samples on the latent space structure, SDE accurately identifies hard samples by automatically computing structure damage score (SDS) for each sample, and directs the model to prioritize optimizing these samples. Experimental results on popular face benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our TopoFR over the state-of-the-art methods.

Moreover, the complex and diverse local topologies of nodes of real-world TAGs make it challenging for a single mechanism to handle. Large language models (LLMs) perform well in zero-/few-shot learning on TAGs but suffer from a scalability challenge. Therefore, we propose a preference-driven knowledge distillation (PKD) framework to synergize the complementary strengths of LLMs and various GNNs for few-shot node classification. Specifically, we develop a GNN-preference-driven node selector that effectively promotes prediction distillation from LLMs to teacher GNNs. To further tackle nodes' intricate local topologies, we develop a node-preference-driven GNN selector that identifies the most suitable teacher GNN for each node, thereby facilitating tailored knowledge distillation from teacher GNNs to the student GNN. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our proposed framework in few-shot node classification on real-world TAGs.

| **[Graph Data Selection for Domain Adaptation: A Model-Free Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17293v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph domain adaptation (GDA) is a fundamental task in graph machine learning, with techniques like shift-robust graph neural networks (GNNs) and specialized training procedures to tackle the distribution shift problem. Although these model-centric approaches show promising results, they often struggle with severe shifts and constrained computational resources. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model-free framework, GRADATE (GRAph DATa sElector), that selects the best training data from the source domain for the classification task on the target domain. GRADATE picks training samples without relying on any GNN model's predictions or training recipes, leveraging optimal transport theory to capture and adapt to distribution changes. GRADATE is data-efficient, scalable and meanwhile complements existing model-centric GDA approaches. Through comprehensive empirical studies on several real-world graph-level datasets and multiple covariate shift types, we demonstrate that GRADATE outperforms existing selection methods and enhances off-the-shelf GDA methods with much fewer training data.</p></details> |  |

The forward problem is numerically solved using the finite element method (FEM), enabling applicability to a wide range of geometries and PDEs. By leveraging the graph structure inherent to FEM discretizations, we employ physics-inspired graph neural networks as learned regularizers, providing a robust, interpretable, and generalizable alternative to standard approaches. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms classical regularization techniques and achieves accurate reconstructions even in highly ill-posed scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Inference of Primordial Magnetic Field Parameters from CMB with Spherical Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20795v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has emerged as a transformative methodology in modern cosmology, providing powerful tools to extract meaningful physical information from complex astronomical datasets. This paper implements a novel Bayesian graph deep learning framework for estimating key cosmological parameters in a primordial magnetic field (PMF) cosmology directly from simulated Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps. Our methodology utilizes DeepSphere, a spherical convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed to respect the spherical geometry of CMB data through HEALPix pixelization. To advance beyond deterministic point estimates and enable robust uncertainty quantification, we integrate Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) into the framework, capturing aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties that reflect the model confidence in its predictions. The proposed approach demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving $R^{2}$ scores exceeding 0.89 for the magnetic parameter estimation. We further obtain well-calibrated uncertainty estimates through post-hoc training techniques including Variance Scaling and GPNormal. This integrated DeepSphere-BNNs framework not only delivers accurate parameter estimation from CMB maps with PMF contributions but also provides reliable uncertainty quantification, providing the necessary tools for robust cosmological inference in the era of precision cosmology.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Integrating Structural and Semantic Signals in Text-Attributed Graphs with BiGTex](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12474v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) present unique challenges in representation learning by requiring models to capture both the semantic richness of node-associated texts and the structural dependencies of the graph. While graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at modeling topological information, they lack the capacity to process unstructured text. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) are proficient in text understanding but are typically unaware of graph structure. In this work, we propose BiGTex (Bidirectional Graph Text), a novel architecture that tightly integrates GNNs and LLMs through stacked Graph-Text Fusion Units. Each unit allows for mutual attention between textual and structural representations, enabling information to flow in both directions, text influencing structure and structure guiding textual interpretation. The proposed architecture is trained using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA), keeping the LLM frozen while adapting to task-specific signals. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that BiGTex achieves state-of-the-art performance in node classification and generalizes effectively to link prediction. An ablation study further highlights the importance of soft prompting and bi-directional attention in the model's success.</p></details> | 26 pages, 4 figures |

This paper investigates whether machine learning can be applied to prioritizing vulnerabilities reported by program analysis tools. We focus on Node.js packages and collect a benchmark of 1,883 Node.js packages, each containing one reported ACE or ACI vulnerability. We evaluate a variety of machine learning approaches, including classical models, graph neural networks (GNNs), large language models (LLMs), and hybrid models that combine GNN and LLMs, trained on data based on a dynamic program analysis tool's output. The top LLM achieves $F_{1} {=} 0.915$, while the best GNN and classical ML models reaching $F_{1} {=} 0.904$. At a less than 7% false-negative rate, the leading model eliminates 66.9% of benign packages from manual review, taking around 60 ms per package. If the best model is tuned to operate at a precision level of 0.8 (i.e., allowing 20% false positives amongst all warnings), our approach can detect 99.2% of exploitable taint flows while missing only 0.8%, demonstrating strong potential for real-world vulnerability triage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Anomaly Prediction with N-BEATS and Graph Neural Network in Multi-variate Semiconductor Process Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20718v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex and precision-driven process, characterized by thousands of interdependent parameters collected across diverse tools and process steps. Multi-variate time-series analysis has emerged as a critical field for real-time monitoring and fault detection in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor data and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly prediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to advance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential step toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault prevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages: (a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies, and (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is compared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a predefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the forecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by utilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second lifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture inter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting performance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly prediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS model while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower computational cost. These results position the GNN as promising solution for online anomaly forecasting to be deployed in manufacturing environments.</p></details> | 17 pages, 27 figures |

With a lack of sufficient specialized treatment resources, such as inpatient beds or staff, there is an unmet need to develop an automated framework for the same. Current decision-making approaches suffer from severe class imbalances in addiction datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a novel graph neural network (GRACE) framework that formalizes locus of care prediction as a structured learning problem. Further, we perform extensive feature engineering and propose a new approach of obtaining an unbiased meta-graph to train a GNN to overcome the class imbalance problem. Experimental results in real-world data show an improvement of 11-35% in terms of the F1 score of the minority class over competitive baselines.

However, solving this mixed-integer non-linear problem for large-scale systems in near-real-time is currently intractable with existing solvers. Machine learning (ML) approaches have emerged as a promising alternative, but they have limited generalization to unseen topologies, varying operating conditions, and different systems, which limits their practical applicability. This paper formulates NTO for congestion management problem considering linearized AC PF, and proposes a graph neural network (GNN)-accelerated approach. We develop a heterogeneous edge-aware message passing NN to predict effective busbar splitting actions as candidate NTO solutions. The proposed GNN captures local flow patterns, achieves generalization to unseen topology changes, and improves transferability across systems. Case studies show up to 4 orders-of-magnitude speed-up, delivering AC-feasible solutions within one minute and a 2.3% optimality gap on the GOC 2000-bus system. These results demonstrate a significant step toward near-real-time NTO for large-scale systems with topology and cross-system generalization.</p></details> |  |

While effective, rewiring inherently alters the graph's structure, raising the risk of distorting important topology-dependent signals. Yet, despite the growing use of rewiring, little is known about which structural properties must be preserved to ensure both performance gains and structural fidelity. In this work, we provide the first systematic analysis of how rewiring affects a range of graph structural metrics, and how these changes relate to downstream task performance. We study seven diverse rewiring strategies and correlate changes in local and global graph properties with node classification accuracy. Our results reveal a consistent pattern: successful rewiring methods tend to preserve local structure while allowing for flexibility in global connectivity. These findings offer new insights into the design of effective rewiring strategies, bridging the gap between graph theory and practical GNN optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 5 figures, conference</p></details> |

Yet, there are few known attempts to incorporate it within forecasting methods. We address this problem with a graph neural network approach that explicitly models these intransitive relationships through temporal directed graphs, with players as nodes and their historical match outcomes as directed edges. We find the bookmaker Pinnacle Sports poorly handles matches with high intransitive complexity and posit that our graph-based approach is uniquely positioned to capture relational dynamics in these scenarios. When selectively betting on higher intransitivity matchups with our model (65.7% accuracy, 0.215 Brier Score), we achieve significant positive returns of 3.26% ROI with Kelly staking over 1903 bets, suggesting a market inefficiency in handling intransitive matchups that our approach successfully exploits.</p></details> | 39 pages, 8 figures |

Traditional prefetching strategies are often limited by their reliance on predefined heuristics or simplified statistical models, which fail to capture the complex, non-linear dependencies in modern data access patterns. This paper introduces a modular framework leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model and predict access patterns within graph-structured data, focusing on web navigation and hierarchical file systems. The toolchain consists of: a route mapper for extracting structural information, a graph constructor for creating graph representations, a walk session generator for simulating user behaviors, and a gnn prefetch module for training and inference. We provide a detailed conceptual analysis showing how GNN-based approaches can outperform conventional methods by learning intricate dependencies. This work offers both theoretical foundations and a practical, replicable pipeline for future research in graph-driven systems optimization.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods generally adopt the Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) framework, requiring costly environment annotations or heuristically generated synthetic splits. To circumvent these limitations, in this work, we aim to develop an IRM-free method for capturing causal subgraphs. We first identify that causal subgraphs exhibit substantially smaller distributional variations than non-causal components across diverse environments, which we formalize as the Invariant Distribution Criterion and theoretically prove in this paper. Building on this criterion, we systematically uncover the quantitative relationship between distributional shift and representation norm for identifying the causal subgraph, and investigate its underlying mechanisms in depth. Finally, we propose an IRM-free method by introducing a norm-guided invariant distribution objective for causal subgraph discovery and prediction. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in graph generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Based Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks for Simulating Nonlinear Solid Mechanics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06045v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based learned simulators have emerged as a promising approach for simulating physical systems on unstructured meshes, offering speed and generalization across diverse geometries. However, they often struggle with capturing global phenomena, such as bending or long-range correlations usually occurring in solid mechanics, and suffer from error accumulation over long rollouts due to their reliance on local message passing and direct next-step prediction. We address these limitations by introducing the Rolling Diffusion-Batched Inference Network (ROBIN), a novel learned simulator that integrates two key innovations: (i) Rolling Diffusion-Batched Inference (ROBI), a parallelized inference scheme that amortizes the cost of diffusion-based refinement across physical time steps by overlapping denoising steps across a temporal window. (ii) A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network built on algebraic multigrid coarsening, enabling multiscale message passing across different mesh resolutions. This architecture, implemented via Algebraic-hierarchical Message Passing Networks, captures both fine-scale local dynamics and global structural effects critical for phenomena like beam bending or multi-body contact. We validate ROBIN on challenging 2D and 3D solid mechanics benchmarks involving geometric, material, and contact nonlinearities. ROBIN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on all tasks, substantially outperforming existing next-step learned simulators while reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude compared to standard diffusion simulators.</p></details> |  |

GNN accuracy can be improved by increasing the model complexity but this also increases the computational cost and memory requirement during training and inference. In this study, we develop Layer-to-Layer Knowledge Mixing (LKM), a novel self-knowledge distillation method that increases the accuracy of state-of-the-art GNNs while adding negligible computational complexity during training and inference. By minimizing the mean absolute distance between pre-existing hidden embeddings of GNN layers, LKM efficiently aggregates multi-hop and multi-scale information, enabling improved representation of both local and global molecular features. We evaluated LKM using three diverse GNN architectures (DimeNet++, MXMNet, and PAMNet) using datasets of quantum chemical properties (QM9, MD17 and Chignolin). We found that the LKM method effectively reduces the mean absolute error of quantum chemical and biophysical property predictions by up to 9.8% (QM9), 45.3% (MD17 Energy), and 22.9% (Chignolin). This work demonstrates the potential of LKM to significantly improve the accuracy of GNNs for chemical property prediction without any substantial increase in training and inference cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text to Band Gap: Pre-trained Language Models as Encoders for Semiconductor Band Gap Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03456v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate transformer-based language models, including RoBERTa, T5, Llama-3, and MatSciBERT, for predicting the band gaps of semiconductor materials directly from textual descriptions. The inputs encode key material features, such as chemical composition, crystal system, space group, and other structural and electronic properties. Unlike shallow machine learning models, which require extensive feature engineering, or Graph Neural Networks, which rely on graph representations derived from atomic coordinates, pretrained language models can process textual inputs directly, eliminating the need for manual feature preprocessing or structure-based encoding. Material descriptions were constructed in two formats: structured strings with a consistent template and natural language narratives generated via the ChatGPT API. Each model was augmented with a custom regression head and finetuned for band gap prediction task. Language models of different architectures and parameter sizes were all able to predict band gaps from human-readable text with strong accuracy, achieving MAEs in the range of 0.25-0.33 eV, highlighting the success of this approach for scientific regression tasks. Finetuned Llama-3, with 1.2 billion parameters, achieved the highest accuracy (MAE 0.248 eV, R2 0.891). MatSciBERT, pretrained on materials science literature, reached comparable performance (MAE 0.288 eV, R2 0.871) with significantly fewer parameters (110 million), emphasizing the importance of domain-specific pretraining. Attention analysis shows that both models selectively focus on compositional and spin-related features while de-emphasizing geometric features, reflecting the difficulty of capturing spatial information from text. These results establish that pretrained language models can effectively extract complex feature-property relationships from textual material descriptions.</p></details> |  |

We observe that heterogeneity naturally appears in temporal interactions, e.g., a few node pairs can make most interaction events, and interaction events happen at varying intervals. This leads to the problems of ineffective temporal information encoding and forgetting of past interactions for a pair of nodes that interact intermittently for their link prediction. Existing methods, however, do not consider such heterogeneity in their learning process, and thus their learned temporal node embeddings are less effective, especially when predicting the links for infrequently interacting node pairs. To cope with the heterogeneity, we propose a novel framework called TAMI, which contains two effective components, namely log time encoding function (LTE) and link history aggregation (LHA). LTE better encodes the temporal information through transforming interaction intervals into more balanced ones, and LHA prevents the historical interactions for each target node pair from being forgotten. State-of-the-art temporal graph neural networks can be seamlessly and readily integrated into TAMI to improve their effectiveness. Experiment results on 13 classic datasets and three newest temporal graph benchmark (TGB) datasets show that TAMI consistently improves the link prediction performance of the underlying models in both transductive and inductive settings.

| **[Extending machine learning model for implicit solvation to free energy calculations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20103v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The implicit solvent approach offers a computationally efficient framework to model solvation effects in molecular simulations. However, its accuracy often falls short compared to explicit solvent models, limiting its use in precise thermodynamic calculations. Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) present an opportunity to overcome these limitations by leveraging neural networks to develop more precise implicit solvent potentials for diverse applications. A major drawback of current ML-based methods is their reliance on force-matching alone, which can lead to energy predictions that differ by an arbitrary constant and are therefore unsuitable for absolute free energy comparisons. Here, we introduce a novel methodology with a graph neural network (GNN)-based implicit solvent model, dubbed Lambda Solvation Neural Network (LSNN). In addition to force-matching, this network was trained to match the derivatives of alchemical variables, ensuring that solvation free energies can be meaningfully compared across chemical species.. Trained on a dataset of approximately 300,000 small molecules, LSNN achieves free energy predictions with accuracy comparable to explicit-solvent alchemical simulations, while offering a computational speedup and establishing a foundational framework for future applications in drug discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training Robust Graph Neural Networks by Modeling Noise Dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19670v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world applications, node features in graphs often contain noise from various sources, leading to significant performance degradation in GNNs. Although several methods have been developed to enhance robustness, they rely on the unrealistic assumption that noise in node features is independent of the graph structure and node labels, thereby limiting their applicability. To this end, we introduce a more realistic noise scenario, dependency-aware noise on graphs (DANG), where noise in node features create a chain of noise dependencies that propagates to the graph structure and node labels. We propose a novel robust GNN, DA-GNN, which captures the causal relationships among variables in the data generating process (DGP) of DANG using variational inference. In addition, we present new benchmark datasets that simulate DANG in real-world applications, enabling more practical research on robust GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DA-GNN consistently outperforms existing baselines across various noise scenarios, including both DANG and conventional noise models commonly considered in this field. Our code is available at https://github.com/yeonjun-in/torch-DA-GNN.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[AGNES: Adaptive Graph Neural Network and Dynamic Programming Hybrid Framework for Real-Time Nanopore Seed Chaining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16013v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nanopore sequencing enables real-time long-read DNA sequencing with reads exceeding 10 kilobases, but inherent error rates of 12-15 percent present significant computational challenges for read alignment. The critical seed chaining step must connect exact k-mer matches between reads and reference genomes while filtering spurious matches, yet state-of-the-art methods rely on fixed gap penalty functions unable to adapt to varying genomic contexts including tandem repeats and structural variants. This paper presents RawHash3, a hybrid framework combining graph neural networks with classical dynamic programming for adaptive seed chaining that maintains real-time performance while providing statistical guarantees. We formalize seed chaining as graph learning where seeds constitute nodes with 12-dimensional feature vectors and edges encode 8-dimensional spatial relationships including gap consistency. Our architecture employs three-layer EdgeConv GNN with confidence-based method selection that dynamically switches between learned guidance and algorithmic fallback. Comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 synthetic nanopore reads with 5,200 test seeds demonstrates RawHash3 achieves 99.94 percent precision and 40.07 percent recall, representing statistically significant 25.0 percent relative improvement over baseline with p less than 0.001. The system maintains median inference latency of 1.59ms meeting real-time constraints, while demonstrating superior robustness with 100 percent success rate under 20 percent label corruption versus baseline degradation to 30.3 percent. Cross-validation confirms stability establishing graph neural networks as viable approach for production genomics pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 12 figures, 6 tables.

| **[RELATE: A Schema-Agnostic Perceiver Encoder for Multimodal Relational Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19954v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relational multi-table data is common in domains such as e-commerce, healthcare, and scientific research, and can be naturally represented as heterogeneous temporal graphs with multi-modal node attributes. Existing graph neural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring separate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders scalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for Latent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature encoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that aggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node representation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark, where it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while reducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and enables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way toward foundation models for relational graph data.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[gLSTM: Mitigating Over-Squashing by Increasing Storage Capacity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08450v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) leverage the graph structure to transmit information between nodes, typically through the message-passing mechanism. While these models have found a wide variety of applications, they are known to suffer from over-squashing, where information from a large receptive field of node representations is collapsed into a single fixed sized vector, resulting in an information bottleneck. In this paper, we re-examine the over-squashing phenomenon through the lens of model storage and retrieval capacity, which we define as the amount of information that can be stored in a node's representation for later use. We study some of the limitations of existing tasks used to measure over-squashing and introduce a new synthetic task to demonstrate that an information bottleneck can saturate this capacity. Furthermore, we adapt ideas from the sequence modeling literature on associative memories, fast weight programmers, and the xLSTM model to develop a novel GNN architecture with improved capacity. We demonstrate strong performance of this architecture both on our capacity synthetic task, as well as a range of real-world graph benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 22 figures, 7 tables. v2: clarified over-squashing separation in light of related work</p></details> |
