| **[Learning Interior Point Method for AC and DC Optimal Power Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19146v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a feasibility-guaranteed learning interior point method (L-IPM) to solve both AC and DC optimal power flow (OPF) problems. Given the criticality of OPF, the proposed L-IPM uses a hybrid learning model approach rather than relying solely on a simple black-box prediction. The traditional IPM follows a central path from an initial point to the optimal solution. However, each iteration involves solving large linear systems, which becomes increasingly expensive as the matrices grow more ill-conditioned in later steps. To address this, we model the IPM trajectory as a time series and train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to project the IPM central path using only the first few stable iterations, which carry the most informative features about the path to optimality. We introduce a grid-informed methodology that enforces operational constraints on generation, voltage magnitudes, and line flows to ensure feasibility. The grid-informed LSTM serves as a tool for the IPM central path projection and, followed by a final IPM refinement step, significantly reduces the total number of iterations and time required for convergence. We use a sampling method to generate a wide range of load scenarios to improve generalization across diverse operating conditions, efficiently covering the power system's operational space. Simulation results on a 2869-bus European high-voltage transmission system show that the proposed L-IPM significantly reduces solution time by up to 94\%, while maintaining accuracy and feasibility of the solution. By leveraging early iterations and bypassing the final ill-conditioned and computationally demanding steps of traditional IPM, the proposed L-IPM reduces the number of required iterations by up to 85.5\%. Since solution feasibility is also guaranteed, L-IPM outperforms the conventional IPM in both computational efficiency and robustness.</p></details> |  |

A fundamental property of RNNs is their ability to create reliable input/output responses, often linked to how the network handles its memory of the information it processed. Various notions have been proposed to conceptualize the behavior of memory in RNNs, including steady states, echo states, state forgetting, input forgetting, and fading memory. Although these notions are often used interchangeably, their precise relationships remain unclear. This work aims to unify these notions in a common language, derive new implications and equivalences between them, and provide alternative proofs to some existing results. By clarifying the relationships between these concepts, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of RNNs and their temporal information processing capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[MCI-GRU: Stock Prediction Model Based on Multi-Head Cross-Attention and Improved GRU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20679v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As financial markets grow increasingly complex in the big data era, accurate stock prediction has become more critical. Traditional time series models, such as GRUs, have been widely used but often struggle to capture the intricate nonlinear dynamics of markets, particularly in the flexible selection and effective utilization of key historical information. Recently, methods like Graph Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning have shown promise in stock prediction but require high data quality and quantity, and they tend to exhibit instability when dealing with data sparsity and noise. Moreover, the training and inference processes for these models are typically complex and computationally expensive, limiting their broad deployment in practical applications. Existing approaches also generally struggle to capture unobservable latent market states effectively, such as market sentiment and expectations, microstructural factors, and participant behavior patterns, leading to an inadequate understanding of market dynamics and subsequently impact prediction accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a stock prediction model, MCI-GRU, based on a multi-head cross-attention mechanism and an improved GRU. First, we enhance the GRU model by replacing the reset gate with an attention mechanism, thereby increasing the model's flexibility in selecting and utilizing historical information. Second, we design a multi-head cross-attention mechanism for learning unobservable latent market state representations, which are further enriched through interactions with both temporal features and cross-sectional features. Finally, extensive experiments on four main stock markets show that the proposed method outperforms SOTA techniques across multiple metrics. Additionally, its successful application in real-world fund management operations confirms its effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeFlow: Temporal Conditioning for Longitudinal Brain MRI Registration and Aging Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08667v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Longitudinal brain analysis is essential for understanding healthy aging and identifying pathological deviations. Longitudinal registration of sequential brain MRI underpins such analyses. However, existing methods are limited by reliance on densely sampled time series, a trade-off between accuracy and temporal smoothness, and an inability to prospectively forecast future brain states. To overcome these challenges, we introduce \emph{TimeFlow}, a learning-based framework for longitudinal brain MRI registration. TimeFlow uses a U-Net backbone with temporal conditioning to model neuroanatomy as a continuous function of age. Given only two scans from an individual, TimeFlow estimates accurate and temporally coherent deformation fields, enabling non-linear extrapolation to predict future brain states. This is achieved by our proposed inter-/extra-polation consistency constraints applied to both the deformation fields and deformed images. Remarkably, these constraints preserve temporal consistency and continuity without requiring explicit smoothness regularizers or densely sampled sequential data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeFlow outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both future timepoint forecasting and registration accuracy. Moreover, TimeFlow supports novel biological brain aging analyses by differentiating neurodegenerative trajectories from normal aging without requiring segmentation, thereby eliminating the need for labor-intensive annotations and mitigating segmentation inconsistency. TimeFlow offers an accurate, data-efficient, and annotation-free framework for longitudinal analysis of brain aging and chronic diseases, capable of forecasting brain changes beyond the observed study period.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Series Analysis of Spiking Neural Systems via Transfer Entropy and Directed Persistent Homology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19048v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a topological framework for analysing neural time series that integrates Transfer Entropy (TE) with directed Persistent Homology (PH) to characterize information flow in spiking neural systems. TE quantifies directional influence between neurons, producing weighted, directed graphs that reflect dynamic interactions. These graphs are then analyzed using PH, enabling assessment of topological complexity across multiple structural scales and dimensions. We apply this TE+PH pipeline to synthetic spiking networks trained on logic gate tasks, image-classification networks exposed to structured and perturbed inputs, and mouse cortical recordings annotated with behavioral events. Across all settings, the resulting topological signatures reveal distinctions in task complexity, stimulus structure, and behavioral regime. Higher-dimensional features become more prominent in complex or noisy conditions, reflecting interaction patterns that extend beyond pairwise connectivity. Our findings offer a principled approach to mapping directed information flow onto global organizational patterns in both artificial and biological neural systems. The framework is generalizable and interpretable, making it well suited for neural systems with time-resolved and binary spiking data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Network inference via approximate Bayesian computation. Illustration on a stochastic multi-population neural mass model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15787v4)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we propose an adapted sequential Monte Carlo approximate Bayesian computation (SMC-ABC) algorithm for network inference in coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) used for multivariate time series modeling. Our approach is motivated by neuroscience, specifically the challenge of estimating brain connectivity before and during epileptic seizures. To this end, we make four key contributions. First, we introduce a 6N-dimensional SDE to model the activity of N coupled neuronal populations, extending the (single-population) stochastic Jansen and Rit neural mass model used to describe human electroencephalography (EEG) rhythms, particularly epileptic activity. Second, we construct a reliable and efficient numerical splitting scheme for the model simulation. Third, we apply the proposed adapted SMC-ABC algorithm to the neural mass model and validate it on different types of simulated data. Compared to standard SMC-ABC, our approach significantly reduces computational cost by requiring fewer model simulations to reach the desired posterior region, thanks to the inclusion of binary parameters describing the presence or absence of coupling directions. Finally, we apply our method to real multi-channel EEG data, uncovering potential similarities in patients' brain activities across different epileptic seizures, as well as differences between pre-seizure and seizure periods.</p></details> | 37 pages, 22 figures |
| **[STDiff: A State Transition Diffusion Framework for Time Series Imputation in Industrial Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19011v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most deep learning methods for imputing missing values treat the task as completing patterns within a fixed time window. This assumption often fails in industrial systems, where dynamics are driven by control actions, are highly non-stationary, and can experience long, uninterrupted gaps. We propose STDiff, which reframes imputation as learning how the system evolves from one state to the next. STDiff uses a conditional denoising diffusion model with a causal bias aligned to control theory, generating missing values step-by-step based on the most recent known state and relevant control or environmental inputs. On a public wastewater treatment dataset with simulated missing blocks, STDiff consistently achieves the lowest errors, with its advantage increasing for longer gaps. On a raw industrial dataset with substantial real gaps, it produces trajectories that remain dynamically plausible, in contrast to window-based models that tend to flatten or over-smooth. These results support dynamics-aware, explicitly conditioned imputation as a robust approach for industrial time series, and we discuss computational trade-offs and extensions to broader domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[PAX-TS: Model-agnostic multi-granular explanations for time series forecasting via localized perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18982v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting has seen considerable improvement during the last years, with transformer models and large language models driving advancements of the state of the art. Modern forecasting models are generally opaque and do not provide explanations for their forecasts, while well-known post-hoc explainability methods like LIME are not suitable for the forecasting context. We propose PAX-TS, a model-agnostic post-hoc algorithm to explain time series forecasting models and their forecasts. Our method is based on localized input perturbations and results in multi-granular explanations. Further, it is able to characterize cross-channel correlations for multivariate time series forecasts. We clearly outline the algorithmic procedure behind PAX-TS, demonstrate it on a benchmark with 7 algorithms and 10 diverse datasets, compare it with two other state-of-the-art explanation algorithms, and present the different explanation types of the method. We found that the explanations of high-performing and low-performing algorithms differ on the same datasets, highlighting that the explanations of PAX-TS effectively capture a model's behavior. Based on time step correlation matrices resulting from the benchmark, we identify 6 classes of patterns that repeatedly occur across different datasets and algorithms. We found that the patterns are indicators of performance, with noticeable differences in forecasting error between the classes. Lastly, we outline a multivariate example where PAX-TS demonstrates how the forecasting model takes cross-channel correlations into account. With PAX-TS, time series forecasting models' mechanisms can be illustrated in different levels of detail, and its explanations can be used to answer practical questions on forecasts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning the Simplest Neural ODE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02019v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the advent of the ``Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE)'' paper, learning ODEs with deep learning has been applied to system identification, time-series forecasting, and related areas. Exploiting the diffeomorphic nature of ODE solution maps, neural ODEs has also enabled their use in generative modeling. Despite the rich potential to incorporate various kinds of physical information, training Neural ODEs remains challenging in practice. This study demonstrates, through the simplest one-dimensional linear model, why training Neural ODEs is difficult. We then propose a new stabilization method and provide an analytical convergence analysis. The insights and techniques presented here serve as a concise tutorial for researchers beginning work on Neural ODEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted SICE FES 2025</p></details> |
| **[pyFAST: A Modular PyTorch Framework for Time Series Modeling with Multi-source and Sparse Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18891v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern time series analysis demands frameworks that are flexible, efficient, and extensible. However, many existing Python libraries exhibit limitations in modularity and in their native support for irregular, multi-source, or sparse data. We introduce pyFAST, a research-oriented PyTorch framework that explicitly decouples data processing from model computation, fostering a cleaner separation of concerns and facilitating rapid experimentation. Its data engine is engineered for complex scenarios, supporting multi-source loading, protein sequence handling, efficient sequence- and patch-level padding, dynamic normalization, and mask-based modeling for both imputation and forecasting. pyFAST integrates LLM-inspired architectures for the alignment-free fusion of sparse data sources and offers native sparse metrics, specialized loss functions, and flexible exogenous data fusion. Training utilities include batch-based streaming aggregation for evaluation and device synergy to maximize computational efficiency. A comprehensive suite of classical and deep learning models (Linears, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and GNNs) is provided within a modular architecture that encourages extension. Released under the MIT license at GitHub, pyFAST provides a compact yet powerful platform for advancing time series research and applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Pre-trained Time Series Features for Tree Species Classification in the Dutch Forest Inventory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18829v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>National Forest Inventory (NFI)s serve as the primary source of forest information, providing crucial tree species distribution data. However, maintaining these inventories requires labor-intensive on-site campaigns. Remote sensing approaches, particularly when combined with machine learning, offer opportunities to update NFIs more frequently and at larger scales. While the use of Satellite Image Time Series has proven effective for distinguishing tree species through seasonal canopy reflectance patterns, current approaches rely primarily on Random Forest classifiers with hand-designed features and phenology-based metrics. Using deep features from an available pre-trained remote sensing foundation models offers a complementary strategy. These pre-trained models leverage unannotated global data and are meant to used for general-purpose applications and can then be efficiently fine-tuned with smaller labeled datasets for specific classification tasks. This work systematically investigates how deep features improve tree species classification accuracy in the Netherlands with few annotated data. Data-wise, we extracted time-series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ERA5 satellites data and SRTM data using Google Earth Engine. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuning a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model outperforms the current state-of-the-art in NFI classification in the Netherlands by a large margin of up to 10% across all datasets. This demonstrates that classic hand-defined harmonic features are too simple for this task and highlights the potential of using deep AI features for data-limited application like NFI classification. By leveraging openly available satellite data and pre-trained models, this approach significantly improves classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and can effectively complement existing forest inventory processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging GNN to Enhance MEF Method in Predicting ENSO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07410v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable long-lead forecasting of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) remains a long-standing challenge in climate science. The previously developed Multimodal ENSO Forecast (MEF) model uses 80 ensemble predictions by two independent deep learning modules: a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) and a time-series module. In their approach, outputs of the two modules are combined using a weighting strategy wherein one is prioritized over the other as a function of global performance. Separate weighting or testing of individual ensemble members did not occur, however, which may have limited the model to optimize the use of high-performing but spread-out forecasts. In this study, we propose a better framework that employs graph-based analysis to directly model similarity between all 80 members of the ensemble. By constructing an undirected graph whose vertices are ensemble outputs and whose weights on edges measure similarity (via RMSE and correlation), we identify and cluster structurally similar and accurate predictions. From which we obtain an optimized subset of 20 members using community detection methods. The final prediction is then obtained by averaging this optimized subset. This method improves the forecast skill through noise removal and emphasis on ensemble coherence. Interestingly, our graph-based selection shows robust statistical characteristics among top performers, offering new ensemble behavior insights. In addition, we observe that while the GNN-based approach does not always outperform the baseline MEF under every scenario, it produces more stable and consistent outputs, particularly in compound long-lead situations. The approach is model-agnostic too, suggesting that it can be applied directly to other forecasting models with gargantuan ensemble outputs, such as statistical, physical, or hybrid models.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[FLAegis: A Two-Layer Defense Framework for Federated Learning Against Poisoning Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18737v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) has become a powerful technique for training Machine Learning (ML) models in a decentralized manner, preserving the privacy of the training datasets involved. However, the decentralized nature of FL limits the visibility of the training process, relying heavily on the honesty of participating clients. This assumption opens the door to malicious third parties, known as Byzantine clients, which can poison the training process by submitting false model updates. Such malicious clients may engage in poisoning attacks, manipulating either the dataset or the model parameters to induce misclassification. In response, this study introduces FLAegis, a two-stage defensive framework designed to identify Byzantine clients and improve the robustness of FL systems. Our approach leverages symbolic time series transformation (SAX) to amplify the differences between benign and malicious models, and spectral clustering, which enables accurate detection of adversarial behavior. Furthermore, we incorporate a robust FFT-based aggregation function as a final layer to mitigate the impact of those Byzantine clients that manage to evade prior defenses. We rigorously evaluate our method against five poisoning attacks, ranging from simple label flipping to adaptive optimization-based strategies. Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art defenses in both detection precision and final model accuracy, maintaining consistently high performance even under strong adversarial conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 tables, and 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Realizing Reduced and Sparse Biochemical Reaction Networks from Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18096v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a direct optimization framework for learning reduced and sparse chemical reaction networks (CRNs) from time-series trajectory data. In contrast to widely used indirect methods-such as those based on sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy)-which infer reaction dynamics by fitting numerically estimated derivatives, our approach fits entire trajectories by solving a dynamically constrained optimization problem. This formulation enables the construction of reduced CRNs that are both low-dimensional and sparse, while preserving key dynamical behaviors of the original system. We develop an accelerated proximal gradient algorithm to efficiently solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem. Through illustrative examples, including a Drosophila circadian oscillator and a glycolytic oscillator, we demonstrate the ability of our method to recover accurate and interpretable reduced-order CRNs. Notably, the direct approach avoids the derivative estimation step and mitigates error accumulation issues inherent in indirect methods, making it a robust alternative for data-driven CRN realizations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE CDC 2025.

| **[Dynamic Count Models with Flexible Innovation Processes for Irregular Maritime Migration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18716v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the dynamics of weekly sea border crossings in the Mediterranean (2015-2025) and the English Channel (2018-2025), we develop a Bayesian dynamic framework for modeling potentially heteroskedastic count time series. Building on theoretical considerations and empirical stylized facts, our approach specifies a latent log-intensity that follows a random walk driven by either heavy-tailed or stochastic volatility innovations, incorporating an explicit mechanism to separate structural from sampling zeros. Posterior inference is carried out via a straightforward Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We compare alternative innovation specifications through a comprehensive out-of-sample density forecasting exercise, evaluating each model using log predictive scores and empirical coverage up to the 99th percentile of the predictive distribution. The results of two case studies reveal strong evidence for stochastic volatility in sea migration innovations, with stochastic volatility models producing particularly well-calibrated forecasts even at extreme quantiles. The model can be used to develop risk indicators and has direct policy implications for improving governance and preparedness for sea migration surges. The presented methodology readily extends to other zero-inflated non-stationary count time series applications, including epidemiological surveillance and public safety incident monitoring.</p></details> |  |
| **[End to End Autoencoder MLP Framework for Sepsis Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18688v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sepsis is a life threatening condition that requires timely detection in intensive care settings. Traditional machine learning approaches, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost, often rely on manual feature engineering and struggle with irregular, incomplete time-series data commonly present in electronic health records. We introduce an end-to-end deep learning framework integrating an unsupervised autoencoder for automatic feature extraction with a multilayer perceptron classifier for binary sepsis risk prediction. To enhance clinical applicability, we implement a customized down sampling strategy that extracts high information density segments during training and a non-overlapping dynamic sliding window mechanism for real-time inference. Preprocessed time series data are represented as fixed dimension vectors with explicit missingness indicators, mitigating bias and noise. We validate our approach on three ICU cohorts. Our end-to-end model achieves accuracies of 74.6 percent, 80.6 percent, and 93.5 percent, respectively, consistently outperforming traditional machine learning baselines. These results demonstrate the framework's superior robustness, generalizability, and clinical utility for early sepsis detection across heterogeneous ICU environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[STRATA-TS: Selective Knowledge Transfer for Urban Time Series Forecasting with Retrieval-Guided Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18635v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban forecasting models often face a severe data imbalance problem: only a few cities have dense, long-span records, while many others expose short or incomplete histories. Direct transfer from data-rich to data-scarce cities is unreliable because only a limited subset of source patterns truly benefits the target domain, whereas indiscriminate transfer risks introducing noise and negative transfer. We present STRATA-TS (Selective TRAnsfer via TArget-aware retrieval for Time Series), a framework that combines domain-adapted retrieval with reasoning-capable large models to improve forecasting in scarce data regimes. STRATA-TS employs a patch-based temporal encoder to identify source subsequences that are semantically and dynamically aligned with the target query. These retrieved exemplars are then injected into a retrieval-guided reasoning stage, where an LLM performs structured inference over target inputs and retrieved support. To enable efficient deployment, we distill the reasoning process into a compact open model via supervised fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on three parking availability datasets across Singapore, Nottingham, and Glasgow demonstrate that STRATA-TS consistently outperforms strong forecasting and transfer baselines, while providing interpretable knowledge transfer pathways.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty Awareness on Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18630v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised domain adaptation methods seek to generalize effectively on unlabeled test data, especially when encountering the common challenge in time series data that distribution shifts occur between training and testing datasets. In this paper, we propose incorporating multi-scale feature extraction and uncertainty estimation to improve the model's generalization and robustness across domains. Our approach begins with a multi-scale mixed input architecture that captures features at different scales, increasing training diversity and reducing feature discrepancies between the training and testing domains. Based on the mixed input architecture, we further introduce an uncertainty awareness mechanism based on evidential learning by imposing a Dirichlet prior on the labels to facilitate both target prediction and uncertainty estimation. The uncertainty awareness mechanism enhances domain adaptation by aligning features with the same labels across different domains, which leads to significant performance improvements in the target domain. Additionally, our uncertainty-aware model demonstrates a much lower Expected Calibration Error (ECE), indicating better-calibrated prediction confidence. Our experimental results show that this combined approach of mixed input architecture with the uncertainty awareness mechanism achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets, underscoring its effectiveness in unsupervised domain adaptation for time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Multimedia</p></details> |
| **[Unified theory of testing relevant hypothesis in functional time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18624v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a general framework for testing relevant hypotheses in functional time series. Our unified approach covers one-sample, two-sample, and change point problems under contaminated observations with arbitrary sampling schemes. By employing B-spline estimators and the self-normalization technique, we propose nuisance-parameter-free testing procedures, obviating the need for additional procedures such as estimating long-run covariance or measurement-error variance functions. A key challenge arises from related nonparametric statistics may not be tight, complicating the joint weak convergence for the test statistics and self-normalizers, particularly in sparse scenarios. To address this, we leverage a Gaussian approximation in a diverging-dimension regime to derive a pivotal approximate distribution. Then, we develop consistent decision rules, provide sufficient conditions ensuring non-degeneracy, and establish phase transition boundaries from sparse to dense. We also examine the multiple change point scenario and extend the theory when one obtains consistent estimates of the change points. The choice of self-normalizers is further discussed, including the recently developed range-adjusted self-normalizer. Extensive numerical experiments support the proposed theory, and we illustrate our methodologies using the AU.SHF implied volatility and traffic volume datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Learning-based Hybrid System Approach for Detecting Contingencies in Distribution Grids with Inverter-Based Resources](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18500v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a machine-learning based Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) modeling framework to detect contingencies in active distribution networks populated with inverter-based resources (IBRs). In particular, this framework allows detecting unobservable contingencies, which cannot be identified by normal sensing systems. First, a state-space SHS model combining conventional and IRB-based resources is introduced to formulate the dynamic interaction between continuous states of distribution networks and discrete contingency events. This model forms a randomly switching system, where parameters or network topology can change due to contingencies. We consider two contingency classes: (i) physical events, such as line outages, and (ii) measurement anomalies caused by sensor faults. Leveraging multivariate time series data derived from high-frequency sampling of system states and network outputs, a time series-based learning model is trained for real-time contingency detection and classification. Simulation studies, carried out on the IEEE 33-bus distribution system, demonstrate a 96% overall detection accuracy.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |
| **[DRTA: Dynamic Reward Scaling for Reinforcement Learning in Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18474v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in time series data is important for applications in finance, healthcare, sensor networks, and industrial monitoring. Traditional methods usually struggle with limited labeled data, high false-positive rates, and difficulty generalizing to novel anomaly types. To overcome these challenges, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework that integrates dynamic reward shaping, Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and active learning, called DRTA. Our method uses an adaptive reward mechanism that balances exploration and exploitation by dynamically scaling the effect of VAE-based reconstruction error and classification rewards. This approach enables the agent to detect anomalies effectively in low-label systems while maintaining high precision and recall. Our experimental results on the Yahoo A1 and Yahoo A2 benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches. These findings show that our framework is a scalable and efficient solution for real-world anomaly detection tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Frozen in Time: Parameter-Efficient Time Series Transformers via Reservoir-Induced Feature Expansion and Fixed Random Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18130v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers are the de-facto choice for sequence modelling, yet their quadratic self-attention and weak temporal bias can make long-range forecasting both expensive and brittle. We introduce FreezeTST, a lightweight hybrid that interleaves frozen random-feature (reservoir) blocks with standard trainable Transformer layers. The frozen blocks endow the network with rich nonlinear memory at no optimisation cost; the trainable layers learn to query this memory through self-attention. The design cuts trainable parameters and also lowers wall-clock training time, while leaving inference complexity unchanged. On seven standard long-term forecasting benchmarks, FreezeTST consistently matches or surpasses specialised variants such as Informer, Autoformer, and PatchTST; with substantially lower compute. Our results show that embedding reservoir principles within Transformers offers a simple, principled route to efficient long-term time-series prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 tables, 3 figures, accepted at ECAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Riemannian Change Point Detection on Manifolds with Robust Centroid Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18045v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-parametric change-point detection in streaming time series data is a long-standing challenge in signal processing. Recent advancements in statistics and machine learning have increasingly addressed this problem for data residing on Riemannian manifolds. One prominent strategy involves monitoring abrupt changes in the center of mass of the time series. Implemented in a streaming fashion, this strategy, however, requires careful step size tuning when computing the updates of the center of mass. In this paper, we propose to leverage robust centroid on manifolds from M-estimation theory to address this issue. Our proposal consists of comparing two centroid estimates: the classical Karcher mean (sensitive to change) versus one defined from Huber's function (robust to change). This comparison leads to the definition of a test statistic whose performance is less sensitive to the underlying estimation method. We propose a stochastic Riemannian optimization algorithm to estimate both robust centroids efficiently. Experiments conducted on both simulated and real-world data across two representative manifolds demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Unsupervised Deep XAI Framework for Localization of Concurrent Replay Attacks in Nuclear Reactor Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09162v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next generation advanced nuclear reactors are expected to be smaller both in size and power output, relying extensively on fully digital instrumentation and control systems. These reactors will generate a large flow of information in the form of multivariate time series data, conveying simultaneously various non linear cyber physical, process, control, sensor, and operational states. Ensuring data integrity against deception attacks is becoming increasingly important for networked communication and a requirement for safe and reliable operation. Current efforts to address replay attacks, almost universally focus on watermarking or supervised anomaly detection approaches without further identifying and characterizing the root cause of the anomaly. In addition, these approaches rely mostly on synthetic data with uncorrelated Gaussian process and measurement noise and full state feedback or are limited to univariate signals, signal stationarity, linear quadratic regulators, or other linear-time invariant state-space which may fail to capture any unmodeled system dynamics. In the realm of regulated nuclear cyber-physical systems, additional work is needed on characterization of replay attacks and explainability of predictions using real data. Here, we propose an unsupervised explainable AI framework based on a combination of autoencoder and customized windowSHAP algorithm to fully characterize real-time replay attacks, i.e., detection, source identification, timing and type, of increasing complexity during a dynamic time evolving reactor process. The proposed XAI framework was benchmarked on several real world datasets from Purdue's nuclear reactor PUR-1 with up to six signals concurrently being replayed. In all cases, the XAI framework was able to detect and identify the source and number of signals being replayed and the duration of the falsification with 95 percent or better accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added references, corrected typos, grammar check, authors updated</p></details> |
| **[A foundation model with multi-variate parallel attention to generate neuronal activity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20354v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from multi-variate time-series with heterogeneous channel configurations remains a fundamental challenge for deep neural networks, particularly in clinical domains such as intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), where channel setups vary widely across subjects. In this work, we introduce multi-variate parallel attention (MVPA), a novel self-attention mechanism that disentangles content, temporal, and spatial attention, enabling flexible, generalizable, and efficient modeling of time-series data with varying channel counts and configurations. We use MVPA to build MVPFormer, a generative foundation model for human electrophysiology, trained to predict the evolution of iEEG signals across diverse subjects. To support this and future efforts by the community, we release the SWEC iEEG dataset, the largest publicly available iEEG dataset to date, comprising nearly 10,000 hours of recordings from heterogeneous clinical sources. MVPFormer leverages MVPA to achieve strong generalization across subjects, demonstrating expert-level performance in several iEEG tasks. MVPFormer surpasses state-of-the-art Transformer baselines in seizure detection across the SWEC, the MAYO, and the FNUSA datasets, while also achieving state-of-the-art performance on four Brain TreeBank iEEG decoding tasks. We further validate MVPA on standard time-series forecasting and classification tasks, where it matches or exceeds the performance of existing attention-based models. Together, our contributions establish MVPA as a general-purpose attention mechanism for heterogeneous time-series and MVPFormer as the first open-source, open-weights, and open-data iEEG foundation model with SOTA clinical performance.

| **[Utilizing Multiple Testing for Grouping in Singular Spectrum Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01665v3)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key step in separating signal from noise in time series by means of singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is grouping. We present a multiple testing method for the grouping step in SSA. As separability criterion, we utilize the weighted correlation between the signal and the noise component of the (reconstructed) time series, and we test whether this weighted correlation is equal to zero. This test has to be performed for several possible groupings, resulting in a multiple test problem. The null distributions of the corresponding test statistics are approximated by a wild bootstrap procedure. The performance of our proposed method is assessed in a simulation study, and we illustrate its practical application with an analysis of real world data.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlexTSF: A Flexible Forecasting Model for Time Series with Variable Regularities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23160v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting time series with irregular temporal structures remains challenging for universal pre-trained models. Existing approaches often assume regular sampling or depend heavily on imputation, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where irregularities are prevalent due to diverse sensing devices and recording practices. We introduce FlexTSF, a flexible forecasting model specifically designed for time series data with variable temporal regularities. At its foundation lies the IVP Patcher, a continuous-time patching module leveraging Initial Value Problems (IVPs) to inherently support uneven time intervals, variable sequence lengths, and missing values. FlexTSF employs a decoder-only architecture that integrates normalized timestamp inputs and domain-specific statistics through a specialized causal self-attention mechanism, enabling adaptability across domains. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate FlexTSF's effectiveness, significantly outperforming existing models in classic forecasting scenarios, zero-shot generalization, and low-resource fine-tuning conditions. Ablation studies confirm the contributions of each design component and the advantage of not relying on predefined fixed patch lengths.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor-product interactions in Markov-switching models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01555v3)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov-switching models are a powerful tool for modelling time series data that are driven by underlying latent states. As such, they are widely used in behavioural ecology, where discrete states can serve as proxies for behavioural modes and enable inference on latent behaviour driving e.g. observed movement. To understand drivers of behavioural changes, it is common to link model parameters to covariates. Over the last decade, nonparametric approaches have gained traction in this context to avoid unrealistic parametric assumptions. Nonetheless, existing methods are largely limited to univariate smooth functions of covariates, based on penalised splines, while real processes are typically complex requiring consideration of interaction effects. We address this gap by incorporating tensor-product interactions into Markov-switching models, enabling flexible modelling of multidimensional effects in a computationally efficient manner. Based on the extended Fellner-Schall method, we develop an efficient automatic smoothness selection procedure that is robust and scales well with the number of smooth functions in the model. The method builds on a random effects view of the spline coefficients and yields a recursive penalised likelihood procedure. As special cases, this general framework accommodates bivariate smoothing, function-valued random effects, and space-time interactions. We demonstrate its practical utility through three ecological case studies of an African elephant, common fruitflies, and Arctic muskoxen. The methodology is implemented in the LaMa R package, providing applied ecologists with an accessible and flexible tool for semiparametric inference in hidden-state models. The approach has the potential to drastically improve the level of detail in inference, allowing to fit HMMs with hundreds of parameters, 10-20 (potentially bivariate) smooths to thousands of observations.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLaP -- State Detection from Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01783v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ever-growing amount of sensor data from machines, smart devices, and the environment leads to an abundance of high-resolution, unannotated time series (TS). These recordings encode recognizable properties of latent states and transitions from physical phenomena that can be modelled as abstract processes. The unsupervised localization and identification of these states and their transitions is the task of time series state detection (TSSD). Current TSSD algorithms employ classical unsupervised learning techniques, to infer state membership directly from feature space. This limits their predictive power, compared to supervised learning methods, which can exploit additional label information. We introduce CLaP, a new, highly accurate and efficient algorithm for TSSD. It leverages the predictive power of time series classification for TSSD in an unsupervised setting by applying novel self-supervision techniques to detect whether data segments emerge from the same state. To this end, CLaP cross-validates a classifier with segment-labelled subsequences to quantify confusion between segments. It merges labels from segments with high confusion, representing the same latent state, if this leads to an increase in overall classification quality. We conducted an experimental evaluation using 405 TS from five benchmarks and found CLaP to be significantly more precise in detecting states than six state-of-the-art competitors. It achieves the best accuracy-runtime tradeoff and is scalable to large TS. We provide a Python implementation of CLaP, which can be deployed in TS analysis workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Artificial Intelligence-Based Multiscale Temporal Modeling for Anomaly Detection in Cloud Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14503v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study proposes an anomaly detection method based on the Transformer architecture with integrated multiscale feature perception, aiming to address the limitations of temporal modeling and scale-aware feature representation in cloud service environments. The method first employs an improved Transformer module to perform temporal modeling on high-dimensional monitoring data, using a self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies and contextual semantics. Then, a multiscale feature construction path is introduced to extract temporal features at different granularities through downsampling and parallel encoding. An attention-weighted fusion module is designed to dynamically adjust the contribution of each scale to the final decision, enhancing the model's robustness in anomaly pattern modeling. In the input modeling stage, standardized multidimensional time series are constructed, covering core signals such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and task scheduling states, while positional encoding is used to strengthen the model's temporal awareness. A systematic experimental setup is designed to evaluate performance, including comparative experiments and hyperparameter sensitivity analysis, focusing on the impact of optimizers, learning rates, anomaly ratios, and noise levels. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms mainstream baseline models in key metrics, including precision, recall, AUC, and F1-score, and maintains strong stability and detection performance under various perturbation conditions, demonstrating its superior capability in complex cloud environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gaussian Process Modeling with Genotype x Environment Kernels for Wheat Performance Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17730v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing wheat variety selection for high performance in different environmental conditions is critical for reliable food production and stable incomes for growers. We employ a statistical machine learning framework utilizing Gaussian Process (GP) models to capture the effects of genetic and environmental factors on wheat yield and protein content. In doing so, selecting suitable covariance kernels to account for the distinct characteristics of the information is essential. The GP approach is closely related to linear mixed-effect models for genotype x environment predictions, where random additive and interaction effects are modeled with covariance structures. However, while commonly used linear mixed effect models in plant breeding rely on Euclidean-based kernels, we also test kernels specifically designed for strings and time series. The resulting GP models are capable of competitively predicting outcomes for (1) new environmental conditions, and (2) new varieties, even in scenarios with little to no previous data for the new conditions or variety. While we focus on a wheat test case using a novel dataset collected in Switzerland, the GP approach presented here can be applied and extended to a wide range of agricultural applications and beyond, paving the way for improved decision-making and data acquisition strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[WaveStitch: Flexible and Fast Conditional Time Series Generation with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06231v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating temporal data under conditions is crucial for forecasting, imputation, and generative tasks. Such data often has metadata and partially observed signals that jointly influence the generated values. However, existing methods face three key limitations: (1) they condition on either the metadata or observed values, but rarely both together; (2) they adopt either training-time approaches that fail to generalize to unseen scenarios, or inference-time approaches that ignore metadata; and (3) they suffer from trade-offs between generation speed and temporal coherence across time windows--choosing either slow but coherent autoregressive methods or fast but incoherent parallel ones. We propose WaveStitch, a novel diffusion-based method to overcome these hurdles through: (1) dual-sourced conditioning on both metadata and partially observed signals; (2) a hybrid training-inference architecture, incorporating metadata during training and observations at inference via gradient-based guidance; and (3) a novel pipeline-style paradigm that generates time windows in parallel while preserving coherence through an inference-time conditional loss and a stitching mechanism. Across diverse datasets, WaveStitch demonstrates adaptability to arbitrary patterns of observed signals, achieving 1.81x lower mean-squared-error compared to the state-of-the-art, and generates data up to 166.48x faster than autoregressive methods while maintaining coherence.

Motivated by various applications, a two-sample test as well as a generalization for multiple matrices are proposed. A partial version of the test is also studied to check whether a partial set of eigenvectors is shared across samples. Additionally, a novel algorithm for the considered testing methods is introduced. Simulation studies demonstrate favorable performance for all designs. Finally, the theoretical results are utilized to decouple vector autoregression models into multiple univariate time series, and to test for the same stationary distribution in recurrent Markov chains. These applications are demonstrated using macroeconomic indices of 8 countries and streamflow data, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Tracking Temporal Evolution of Topological Features in Image Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17530v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topological Data Analysis (TDA) can be used to detect and characterize holes in an image, such as zero-dimensional holes (connected components) or one-dimensional holes (loops). However, there is currently no widely accepted statistical framework for modeling spatiotemporal dependence in the evolution of topological features, such as holes, within a time series of images. We propose a hypothesis testing framework to identify statistically significant topological features of images in space and time, simultaneously. This addition of time may induce higher-dimensional topological features which can be used to establish temporal connections between the lower-dimensional features at each point in time. The temporal evolution of these lower-dimensional features is then represented on a zigzag persistence diagram, as a topological summary statistic focused on time dynamics. We demonstrate that the method effectively captures the emergence and progression of topological features in a study of a series of images of a wounded cell as it repairs. The proposed method outperforms a current approach in a simulation study that includes features of the wound healing process. Since, the wounded cell images exhibit nonlinear, dynamic, spatial, and temporal structures during single-cell repair, they provide a good application for this method.</p></details> | 24 pages, 9 Figures |
| **[Modeling Irregular Astronomical Time Series with Neural Stochastic Delay Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17521v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Astronomical time series from large-scale surveys like LSST are often irregularly sampled and incomplete, posing challenges for classification and anomaly detection. We introduce a new framework based on Neural Stochastic Delay Differential Equations (Neural SDDEs) that combines stochastic modeling with neural networks to capture delayed temporal dynamics and handle irregular observations. Our approach integrates a delay-aware neural architecture, a numerical solver for SDDEs, and mechanisms to robustly learn from noisy, sparse sequences. Experiments on irregularly sampled astronomical data demonstrate strong classification accuracy and effective detection of novel astrophysical events, even with partial labels. This work highlights Neural SDDEs as a principled and practical tool for time series analysis under observational constraints.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods often rely on imputation, which may introduce bias or fail to capture the underlying temporal dynamics. In this paper, we propose TANDEM (Temporal Attention-guided Neural Differential Equations for Missingness), an attention-guided neural differential equation framework that effectively classifies time series data with missing values. Our approach integrates raw observation, interpolated control path, and continuous latent dynamics through a novel attention mechanism, allowing the model to focus on the most informative aspects of the data. We evaluate TANDEM on 30 benchmark datasets and a real-world medical dataset, demonstrating its superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods. Our framework not only improves classification accuracy but also provides insights into the handling of missing data, making it a valuable tool in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[GateTS: Versatile and Efficient Forecasting via Attention-Inspired routed Mixture-of-Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17515v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate univariate forecasting remains a pressing need in real-world systems, such as energy markets, hydrology, retail demand, and IoT monitoring, where signals are often intermittent and horizons span both short- and long-term. While transformers and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are increasingly favored for time-series forecasting, a key gap persists: MoE models typically require complicated training with both the main forecasting loss and auxiliary load-balancing losses, along with careful routing/temperature tuning, which hinders practical adoption. In this paper, we propose a model architecture that simplifies the training process for univariate time series forecasting and effectively addresses both long- and short-term horizons, including intermittent patterns. Our approach combines sparse MoE computation with a novel attention-inspired gating mechanism that replaces the traditional one-layer softmax router. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our gating design naturally promotes balanced expert utilization and achieves superior predictive accuracy without requiring the auxiliary load-balancing losses typically used in classical MoE implementations. The model achieves better performance while utilizing only a fraction of the parameters required by state-of-the-art transformer models, such as PatchTST. Furthermore, experiments across diverse datasets confirm that our MoE architecture with the proposed gating mechanism is more computationally efficient than LSTM for both long- and short-term forecasting, enabling cost-effective inference. These results highlight the potential of our approach for practical time-series forecasting applications where both accuracy and computational efficiency are critical.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Interpretable Differentiable Logic Networks for Time-Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17512v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable logic networks (DLNs) have shown promising results in tabular domains by combining accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency. In this work, we apply DLNs to the domain of TSC for the first time, focusing on univariate datasets. To enable DLN application in this context, we adopt feature-based representations relying on Catch22 and TSFresh, converting sequential time series into vectorized forms suitable for DLN classification. Unlike prior DLN studies that fix the training configuration and vary various settings in isolation via ablation, we integrate all such configurations into the hyperparameter search space, enabling the search process to select jointly optimal settings. We then analyze the distribution of selected configurations to better understand DLN training dynamics. We evaluate our approach on 51 publicly available univariate TSC benchmarks. The results confirm that classification DLNs maintain their core strengths in this new domain: they deliver competitive accuracy, retain low inference cost, and provide transparent, interpretable decision logic, thus aligning well with previous DLN findings in the realm of tabular classification and regression tasks.</p></details> |  |

This study investigates the application of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques specifically adapted for time-series ECG analysis. Using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset, a convolutional neural network-based model was developed for arrhythmia classification, with R-peak-based segmentation via the Pan-Tompkins algorithm. To increase the dataset size and to reduce class imbalance, an additional 12-lead ECG dataset was incorporated. A user needs assessment was carried out to identify what kind of explanation would be preferred by medical professionals. Medical professionals indicated a preference for saliency map-based explanations over counterfactual visualisations, citing clearer correspondence with ECG interpretation workflows. Four SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based approaches: permutation importance, KernelSHAP, gradient-based methods, and Deep Learning Important FeaTures (DeepLIFT), were implemented and compared. The model achieved 98.3% validation accuracy on MIT-BIH but showed performance degradation on the combined dataset, underscoring dataset variability challenges. Permutation importance and KernelSHAP produced cluttered visual outputs, while gradient-based and DeepLIFT methods highlighted waveform regions consistent with clinical reasoning, but with variability across samples. Findings emphasize the need for domain-specific XAI adaptations in ECG analysis and highlight saliency mapping as a more clinically intuitive approach</p></details> |  |

Despite their strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs remain underutilized for motion sensor data due to the lack of semantic context in time-series, computational constraints, and challenges in processing numerical inputs. SensorLLM addresses these limitations through a Sensor-Language Alignment stage, where the model aligns sensor inputs with trend descriptions. Special tokens are introduced to mark channel boundaries. This alignment enables LLMs to capture numerical variations, channel-specific features, and data of varying durations, without requiring human annotations. In the subsequent Task-Aware Tuning stage, we refine the model for HAR classification, achieving performance that matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate that SensorLLM evolves into an effective sensor learner, reasoner, and classifier through human-intuitive Sensor-Language Alignment, generalizing across diverse HAR datasets. We believe this work establishes a foundation for future research on time-series and text alignment, paving the way for foundation models in sensor data analysis.

Unlike existing neural ODEs that predict only state trajectories, UPN simultaneously model both state evolution and its associated uncertainty by parameterizing coupled differential equations for mean and covariance dynamics. The architecture efficiently propagates uncertainty through nonlinear dynamics without discretization artifacts by solving coupled ODEs for state and covariance evolution while enabling state-dependent, learnable process noise. The continuous-depth formulation adapts its evaluation strategy to each input's complexity, provides principled uncertainty quantification, and handles irregularly-sampled observations naturally. Experimental results demonstrate UPN's effectiveness across multiple domains: continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with uncertainty quantification, time-series forecasting with well-calibrated confidence intervals, and robust trajectory prediction in both stable and chaotic dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |

However, practitioners often resort to ad-hoc, non-standardized scripts, as common metrics are often unsuitable for specialized, structured outputs (e.g., automated plans, time-series) or holistic comparison across modalities (e.g., text, audio, and image). This fragmentation hinders comparability and slows AI system development. To address this challenge, we present GAICo (Generative AI Comparator): a deployed, open-source Python library that streamlines and standardizes GenAI output comparison. GAICo provides a unified, extensible framework supporting a comprehensive suite of reference-based metrics for unstructured text, specialized structured data formats, and multimedia (images, audio). Its architecture features a high-level API for rapid, end-to-end analysis, from multi-model comparison to visualization and reporting, alongside direct metric access for granular control. We demonstrate GAICo's utility through a detailed case study evaluating and debugging complex, multi-modal AI Travel Assistant pipelines. GAICo empowers AI researchers and developers to efficiently assess system performance, make evaluation reproducible, improve development velocity, and ultimately build more trustworthy AI systems, aligning with the goal of moving faster and safer in AI deployment.

Because of the lack of transparency, it is challenging to understand the reasoning behind the model's predictions. Here, we present an approach to making a deep learning-based solar storm prediction model interpretable, where solar storms include solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). This deep learning model, built based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) network with an attention mechanism, aims to predict whether an active region (AR) on the Sun's surface that produces a flare within 24 hours will also produce a CME associated with the flare. The crux of our approach is to model data samples in an AR as time series and use the LSTM network to capture the temporal dynamics of the data samples. To make the model's predictions accountable and reliable, we leverage post hoc model-agnostic techniques, which help elucidate the factors contributing to the predicted output for an input sequence and provide insights into the model's behavior across multiple sequences within an AR. To our knowledge, this is the first time that interpretability has been added to an LSTM-based solar storm prediction model.</p></details> | 6 pages, 8 figures |

The information transmission rate is the fundamental measure for systems with time-varying signals, yet computing it is extremely challenging. In particular, the rate cannot be obtained directly from experimental time-series data without approximations, because of the high dimensionality of the signal trajectory space. Path Weight Sampling (PWS) is a computational technique that makes it possible to obtain the information rate exactly for any stochastic system. However, it requires a mathematical model of the system of interest, be it described by a master equation or a set of differential equations. Here, we present a technique that employs Machine Learning (ML) to develop a generative model from experimental time-series data, which is then combined with PWS to obtain the information rate. We demonstrate the accuracy of this technique, called ML-PWS, by comparing its results on synthetic time-series data generated from a non-linear model against ground-truth results obtained by applying PWS directly to the same model. We illustrate the utility of ML-PWS by applying it to neuronal time-series data.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |

Although Transformer-based models have made significant breakthroughs in forecasting, their effectiveness for time series forecasting remains debatable. In this paper, we revisit the significance of self-attention and propose a simple yet effective mechanism, Periodic-Nested Group Attention, namely PENGUIN. Our approach highlights the importance of explicitly modeling periodic patterns and incorporating relative attention bias for effective time series modeling. To this end, we introduce a periodic-nested relative attention bias that captures periodic structures directly. To handle multiple coexisting periodicities (e.g., daily and weekly cycles), we design a grouped attention mechanism, where each group targets a specific periodicity using a multi-query attention mechanism. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that PENGUIN consistently outperforms both MLP-based and Transformer-based models.</p></details> |  |

Such time series usually arise when a longer temporal or spatio-temporal point process is sliced into smaller time units; for example, when an annual process is sliced into 365 daily replications. We assume the point processes follow a doubly-stochastic Poisson model with log-Gaussian intensity functions. The proposed autocorrelograms are computationally simple and based on binning. The asymptotic distribution of the autocorrelations is established. The ability of the method to detect the patterns of common autoregressive and moving-average time series models is shown by simulation. Two examples of application to temporal and spatial point-process time series are shown, pertaining bike demand in the Divvy bike-sharing system of Chicago and street theft in Chicago, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Unlike the traditional factor analysis which flattens matrix observations into vectors, we adopt a matrix factor model in order to fully explore the intrinsic matrix structure in the data, allowing interaction between the row and column stochastic trends, and subsequently improving the estimation convergence. It also reduces the computation complexity in estimation. The main estimation methodology is built on the eigenanalysis of sample row and column covariance matrices when the nonstationary matrix factors are of full rank and the idiosyncratic components are temporally stationary, and is further extended to tackle a more flexible setting when the matrix factors are cointegrated and the idiosyncratic components may be nonstationary. Under some mild conditions which allow the existence of weak factors, we derive the convergence theory for the estimated factor loading matrices and nonstationary factor matrices. In particular, the developed methodology and theory are applicable to the general case of heterogeneous strengths over weak factors. An easy-to-implement ratio criterion is adopted to consistently estimate the size of latent factor matrix. Both simulation and empirical studies are conducted to examine the numerical performance of the developed model and methodology in finite samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Time Series into LLMs via Multi-layer Steerable Embedding Fusion for Enhanced Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16059v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series (TS) data are ubiquitous across various application areas, rendering time series forecasting (TSF) a fundamental task. With the astounding advances in large language models (LLMs), a variety of methods have been developed to adapt LLMs for time series forecasting. Despite unlocking the potential of LLMs in comprehending TS data, existing methods are inherently constrained by their shallow integration of TS information, wherein LLMs typically access TS representations at shallow layers, primarily at the input layer. This causes the influence of TS representations to progressively fade in deeper layers and eventually leads to ineffective adaptation between textual embeddings and TS representations. In this paper, we propose the Multi-layer Steerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF), a novel framework that enables LLMs to directly access time series patterns at all depths, thereby mitigating the progressive loss of TS information in deeper layers. Specifically, MSEF leverages off-the-shelf time series foundation models to extract semantically rich embeddings, which are fused with intermediate text representations across LLM layers via layer-specific steering vectors. These steering vectors are designed to continuously optimize the alignment between time series and textual modalities and facilitate a layer-specific adaptation mechanism that ensures efficient few-shot learning capabilities.

| **[Generative Foundation Model for Structured and Unstructured Electronic Health Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16054v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic health records (EHRs) are rich clinical data sources but complex repositories of patient data, spanning structured elements (demographics, vitals, lab results, codes), unstructured clinical notes and other modalities of data. Harnessing this heterogeneity is critical for improving patient outcomes. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled foundation models that can learn from multiple data modalities and support clinical tasks. However, most current approaches simply serialize numeric EHR data into text, which risks losing temporal and quantitative detail. We introduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that natively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and fuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a LLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining, where it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while also performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction (NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for clinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day readmission). In clinical prediction, GDP demonstrated superior performance on MIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC = 0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC = 0.817, and 30-day readmission AUROC = 0.627. For narrative generation, GDP achieved ROUGE-L = 0.135 and BERTScore-F1 = 0.545. In a blinded human evaluation, GDP-Instruct scored highest on faithfulness, fluency, and overall clinical utility, suggesting reduced hospital documentation workload without sacrificing accuracy. Our results demonstrate that a single multimodal foundation model can both predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical narratives. Furthermore, GDP's flexible architecture can be extended to additional modalities.</p></details> |  |

It builds upon the work of Altuhaifa, which used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data from 1975-2018 to evaluate these models. Altuhaifa's study found that ARIMA (0,2,2), SES with smoothing parameter $\alpha=0.995$, and HDES with parameters $\alpha=0.4$ and $\beta=0.9$ were the optimal models from their analysis, with HDES providing the lowest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 132.91. The paper extends the dataset to 2021 and re-evaluates the models. Using the same SEER data from 1975-2021, it identifies ARIMA (0,2,2), SES ($\alpha=0.999$), and HDES ($\alpha=0.5221$, $\beta=0.5219$) as the best-fitting models. Interestingly, ARIMA (0,2,2) and HDES yield the lowest RMSE of 2.56. To obtain forecasts with higher accuracy, an average model (HDES-ARIMA) consisting of HDES and ARIMA was constructed to leverage their strengths. The HDES-ARIMA model also achieves an RMSE of 2.56. The forecast from the average model suggests declining lung cancer mortality rates in the United States. The study highlights how expanding datasets and re-evaluating models can provide updated insights. It recommends further analysis using monthly data separated by gender, ethnicity, and state to understand lung cancer mortality dynamics in the United States. Overall, advanced time series methods like HDES and ARIMA show strong potential for accurately forecasting this major public health issue.</p></details> |  |

| **[Transforming Causality: Transformer-Based Temporal Causal Discovery with Prior Knowledge Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15928v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel framework for temporal causal discovery and inference that addresses two key challenges: complex nonlinear dependencies and spurious correlations. Our approach employs a multi-layer Transformer-based time-series forecaster to capture long-range, nonlinear temporal relationships among variables. After training, we extract the underlying causal structure and associated time lags from the forecaster using gradient-based analysis, enabling the construction of a causal graph. To mitigate the impact of spurious causal relationships, we introduce a prior knowledge integration mechanism based on attention masking, which consistently enforces user-excluded causal links across multiple Transformer layers. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, achieving a 12.8% improvement in F1-score for causal discovery and 98.9% accuracy in estimating causal lags.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tutorial on the Probabilistic Unification of Estimation Theory, Machine Learning, and Generative AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15719v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extracting meaning from uncertain, noisy data is a fundamental problem across time series analysis, pattern recognition, and language modeling. This survey presents a unified mathematical framework that connects classical estimation theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning, including deep learning and large language models. By analyzing how techniques such as maximum likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, and attention mechanisms address uncertainty, the paper illustrates that many AI methods are rooted in shared probabilistic principles. Through illustrative scenarios including system identification, image classification, and language generation, we show how increasingly complex models build upon these foundations to tackle practical challenges like overfitting, data sparsity, and interpretability. In other words, the work demonstrates that maximum likelihood, MAP estimation, Bayesian classification, and deep learning all represent different facets of a shared goal: inferring hidden causes from noisy and/or biased observations. It serves as both a theoretical synthesis and a practical guide for students and researchers navigating the evolving landscape of machine learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Time-Series Causal Discovery with Approximate Causal Ordering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05500v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery in time-series data presents a significant computational challenge. Standard algorithms are often prohibitively expensive for datasets with many variables or samples. This study introduces and validates a heuristic approximation of the VarLiNGAM algorithm to address this scalability problem. The standard VarLiNGAM method relies on an iterative search, recalculating statistical dependencies after each step. Our heuristic modifies this procedure by omitting the iterative refinement. This change permits a one-time precomputation of all necessary statistical values. The algorithmic modification reduces the time complexity from $O(m^3n)$ to $O(m^2n + m^3)$ while keeping the space complexity at $O(m^2)$, where $m$ is the number of variables and $n$ is the number of samples. While an approximation, our approach retains VarLiNGAM's essential structure and empirical reliability. On large-scale financial data with up to 400 variables, our algorithm achieves a 7--13x speedup over the standard implementation and a 4.5x speedup over a GPU-accelerated version. Evaluations across medical imaging, web server monitoring, and finance demonstrate the heuristic's robustness and practical scalability. This work offers a validated balance between computational efficiency and discovery quality, making large-scale causal analysis feasible on personal computers.</p></details> |  |

By modeling the grid as a graph and using voltage magnitude data of individual nodes in the grid, the mutual information between pairs of nodes is computed using different approximation methods. Using the well-known Chow-Liu algorithm, a maximum spanning tree based on mutual information is computed to estimate the power grid topology. This manuscript explores the application of this method to different datasets and explores the domain of applicability. The data quality, precision, time windows, frequency and the method for calculating the mutual information are varied to see the effect on the successful reconstruction of the graph and it's leaf nodes. Success shown for IEEE networks generated with MATPOWER and data generated using GridLAB-D. The algorithm is then cross-validated on IEEE networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI-Powered Machine Learning Approaches for Fault Diagnosis in Industrial Pumps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15550v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a practical approach for early fault detection in industrial pump systems using real-world sensor data from a large-scale vertical centrifugal pump operating in a demanding marine environment. Five key operational parameters were monitored: vibration, temperature, flow rate, pressure, and electrical current. A dual-threshold labeling method was applied, combining fixed engineering limits with adaptive thresholds calculated as the 95th percentile of historical sensor values. To address the rarity of documented failures, synthetic fault signals were injected into the data using domain-specific rules, simulating critical alerts within plausible operating ranges. Three machine learning classifiers - Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - were trained to distinguish between normal operation, early warnings, and critical alerts. Results showed that Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved high accuracy across all classes, including minority cases representing rare or emerging faults, while the SVM model exhibited lower sensitivity to anomalies. Visual analyses, including grouped confusion matrices and time-series plots, indicated that the proposed hybrid method provides robust detection capabilities. The framework is scalable, interpretable, and suitable for real-time industrial deployment, supporting proactive maintenance decisions before failures occur. Furthermore, it can be adapted to other machinery with similar sensor architectures, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for predictive maintenance in complex systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[CC-Time: Cross-Model and Cross-Modality Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12235v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the success of pre-trained language models (PLMs) in various application fields beyond natural language processing, language models have raised emerging attention in the field of time series forecasting (TSF) and have shown great prospects. However, current PLM-based TSF methods still fail to achieve satisfactory prediction accuracy matching the strong sequential modeling power of language models. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Model and Cross-Modality Learning with PLMs for time series forecasting (CC-Time). We explore the potential of PLMs for time series forecasting from two aspects: 1) what time series features could be modeled by PLMs, and 2) whether relying solely on PLMs is sufficient for building time series models. In the first aspect, CC-Time incorporates cross-modality learning to model temporal dependency and channel correlations in the language model from both time series sequences and their corresponding text descriptions. In the second aspect, CC-Time further proposes the cross-model fusion block to adaptively integrate knowledge from the PLMs and time series model to form a more comprehensive modeling of time series patterns. Extensive experiments on nine real-world datasets demonstrate that CC-Time achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy in both full-data training and few-shot learning situations.</p></details> |  |

They include tasks such as summation or finding the median among the items of the same group, and within a specified number of the last observed tuples for sliding window aggregation (SWAG). They have a wide range of applications including database analytics, operating systems, bank security and medical sensors. Existing challenges include the hardware complexity that comes with efficiently handling per-group states using hash-based approaches. This paper presents an adaptable pipeline for calculating a wide range of aggregation queries with high throughput. It is then adapted for SWAG and achieves up to 476x speedup over the CPU core of the same platform. It achieves unparalleled levels of performance and functionality such as a throughput of 1 GT/s on our setup for SWAG without groups, and more advanced operators with up to 4x the window sizes than the state-of-the-art with groups as an approximation for SWAG featuring per-group windows using a fraction of the resources and no DRAM.</p></details> |  |

We present DiagECG, a novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task, enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model, DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

| **[Learning ECG Representations via Poly-Window Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15225v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is foundational for cardiovascular disease diagnosis, yet the performance of deep learning models is often constrained by limited access to annotated data. Self-supervised contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from unlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG recordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning framework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired by the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages the model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features that persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive experiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate that poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to four times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock pre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we achieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total computation time, making our method practical for training foundational models. Through extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate robustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window contrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated ECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised representation learning in biomedical time-series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication in IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics 2025.

However, manual inspection of EEG characteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error. Although machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively developed, they continue to face challenges from the non-stationarity and variability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) signals, often leading to poor generalization on unseen datasets. This research proposed a Sleep Stage Classification method by developing Multivariate Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) for joint EEG and EOG representation learning. Specifically, SleepDIFFormer was developed to process EEG and EOG signals using our Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) for time series, trained with cross-domain alignment. Our method mitigated spatial and temporal attention noise while learning a domain-invariant joint EEG-EOG representation through feature distribution alignment, thereby enabling generalization to unseen target datasets. Empirically, we evaluated our method on five different sleep staging datasets and compared it with existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted thorough ablation analyses of SleepDIFFormer and interpreted the differential attention weights, highlighting their relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns. These findings have implications for advancing automated sleep stage classification and its application to sleep quality assessment. Our source code is publicly available at https://github.com/Ben1001409/SleepDIFFormer</p></details> | 8 Pages |
| **[On the Performance of Linear Adaptive Filters driven by the Ergodic Chaotic Logistic Map](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15143v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chaotic dynamical systems are increasingly considered for use in coding and transmission systems. This stems from their parameter sensitivity and spectral characteristics. The latter are relevant for channel estimation methods. In particular the logistic map $f_\lambda =\lambda x\left( 1-x\right) $ has been employed in chaotic coding and spread spectrum transmission systems. For $\lambda =4$ the statistical properties of sequences generated by $f_4$ are considered as ideal drive signals for channel estimation schemes. This assumption is proven in the present paper. To this end the higher order statistical moments and the autocorrelation of time series generated by $f_4$ are derived. It is shown that for $\lambda =4$ the zero mean time series is uncorrelated. The adaptation performance of finite impulse response (FIR) digital adaptive filters (DAF) used for channel estimation is analyzed. It is shown that using zero mean sequences of $f_4$ leads to the maximal possible FIR DAF performance. An optimal value for the damping parameter in the LMS scheme is derived that leads to the maximal performance and ensures stability. The analytic considerations are confirmed by simulation results.</p></details> |  |

Implementing smart charging mechanisms can mitigate these adverse effects and defer or even avoid upgrades. This study assesses the performance of two smart charging strategies - Time of Use (TOU) pricing and Load Balancing (LB) on seven representative real-world feeders identified using k-means clustering. A time series-based steady-state load flow analysis was conducted on these feeders to simulate the impact of EV charging under both strategies across four different EV enrollment scenarios and three representative days to capture seasonal load characteristics. A grid upgrade strategy has been proposed to strengthen the power grid to support EV integration with minimal cost. Results demonstrate that both TOU and LB strategies effectively manage the additional EV load with reduced upgrade requirement and cost to existing infrastructure compared to the case without smart charging strategies and LB outperforms TOU when the customer enrollment levels are high. These findings support the viability of smart charging in facilitating EV integration while maintaining distribution network reliability and reducing investment cost.</p></details> |  |

However, satellite time series are voluminous and often corrupted, making them challenging to use. We present TESSERA, an open, global, land-oriented remote sensing foundation model that uses self-supervised learning to generate `ready-to-use' embeddings at 10~m scale from pixel-level satellite time-series data. TESSERA uses two encoders to combine optical data with synthetic aperture radar backscatter coefficients at 10~m resolution to create embeddings that are fused with a multilayer perceptron to create annual global embedding maps. We compare our work with state-of-the-art task-specific models and other foundation models in five diverse downstream tasks and find that TESSERA closely matches or outperforms these baselines. We believe that TESSERA's ease of use, state-of-the-art performance, openness, and computation- and labelled data-efficiency will prove transformative in a wide range of ecological applications.</p></details> |  |

However, a persistent challenge remains the short battery lifetime of such compact sensor edge devices. Integrating artificial intelligence can help overcome this limitation by enabling intelligent real-time decision-making, thereby reducing the energy consumption and prolonging the battery life. However, this remains challenging due to data sparsity and the limited resources of the device restricting the overall model size. In this work, we introduce a multi-task neural network that combines the functionalities of precise self-localization within the gastrointestinal tract with the ability to detect anomalies in the small intestine within a single model. Throughout the development process, we consistently restricted the total number of parameters to ensure the feasibility to deploy such model in a small capsule. We report the first multi-task results using the recently published Galar dataset, integrating established multi-task methods and Viterbi decoding for subsequent time-series analysis. This outperforms current single-task models and represents a significant advance in AI-based approaches in this field. Our model achieves an accuracy of 93.63% on the localization task and an accuracy of 87.48% on the anomaly detection task.

This enables smart meters to report consumption values at predefined intervals to utility providers for purposes including demand balancing, load forecasting, dynamic billing, and operational efficiency. Compared to traditional power grids, smart grids offer advantages such as enhanced reliability, improved energy efficiency, and increased security. However, utility providers can compromise user privacy by analyzing fine-grained readings and extracting individuals' daily activities from this time-series data. To address this concern, we propose a collusion-resistant, privacy-preserving aggregation protocol for smart metering in operational services. Our protocol ensures privacy by leveraging techniques such as partially additive homomorphic encryption, aggregation, data perturbation, and data minimization. The scheme aggregates perturbed readings using the additive homomorphic property of the Paillier cryptosystem to provide results for multiple operational purposes. We evaluate the protocol in terms of both performance and privacy. Computational, memory, and communication overhead were examined. The total execution time with 1024-bit key size is about 2.21 seconds. We also evaluated privacy through the normalized conditional entropy (NCE) metric. Higher NCE values, closer to 1, indicate stronger privacy. By increasing noise scale, the NCE value rises, showing perturbed values retain minimal information about the original, thereby reducing risks. Overall, evaluation demonstrates the protocol's efficiency while employing various privacy-preserving techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Focusing on conditions observed over half tidal cycles, we observe that such data fall within the framework of functional extreme value theory, but violate standard assumptions due to temporal dependence and short-tailed behavior.a To address this, we propose a two-stage methodology. First, we introduce an autoregressive model to eliminate temporal dependence between cycles. Second, considering the model residuals, we adapt existing techniques based on Pareto processes. This allows us to build a simulator of extreme scenarios, by applying inverse transformations. These simulations depend on an initial time series, which can be randomly selected to tune the desired level of extremes. We validate the simulator performance by comparing simulated times series with observations, through several criteria, based on principal component analysis, extreme value analysis, and classification algorithms. The approach is applied to the surge data, on the G{\^a}vres site, located in southern Brittany, France.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have inspired the development of numerous time series foundation models (TSFMs) for time series forecasting, their effectiveness in EPF remains uncertain. To address this gap, we benchmark several state-of-the-art pretrained models--Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-T5, TimesFM, Moirai, Time-MoE, and TimeGPT--against established statistical and machine learning (ML) methods for EPF. Using 2024 day-ahead auction (DAA) electricity prices from Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria, and Belgium, we generate daily forecasts with a one-day horizon. Chronos-Bolt and Time-MoE emerge as the strongest among the TSFMs, performing on par with traditional models. However, the biseasonal MSTL model, which captures daily and weekly seasonality, stands out for its consistent performance across countries and evaluation metrics, with no TSFM statistically outperforming it.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Organ-Agents, a multi-agent framework that simulates human physiology via LLM-driven agents. Each Simulator models a specific system (e.g., cardiovascular, renal, immune). Training consists of supervised fine-tuning on system-specific time-series data, followed by reinforcement-guided coordination using dynamic reference selection and error correction. We curated data from 7,134 sepsis patients and 7,895 controls, generating high-resolution trajectories across 9 systems and 125 variables. Organ-Agents achieved high simulation accuracy on 4,509 held-out patients, with per-system MSEs <0.16 and robustness across SOFA-based severity strata. External validation on 22,689 ICU patients from two hospitals showed moderate degradation under distribution shifts with stable simulation. Organ-Agents faithfully reproduces critical multi-system events (e.g., hypotension, hyperlactatemia, hypoxemia) with coherent timing and phase progression. Evaluation by 15 critical care physicians confirmed realism and physiological plausibility (mean Likert ratings 3.9 and 3.7). Organ-Agents also enables counterfactual simulations under alternative sepsis treatment strategies, generating trajectories and APACHE II scores aligned with matched real-world patients. In downstream early warning tasks, classifiers trained on synthetic data showed minimal AUROC drops (<0.04), indicating preserved decision-relevant patterns. These results position Organ-Agents as a credible, interpretable, and generalizable digital twin for precision diagnosis, treatment simulation, and hypothesis testing in critical care.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Autoregressive Switching Processes with Cumulative Shrinkage Priors for Graphical Modeling of Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03385v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a flexible Bayesian approach for sparse Gaussian graphical modeling of multivariate time series. We account for temporal correlation in the data by assuming that observations are characterized by an underlying and unobserved hidden discrete autoregressive process. We assume multivariate Gaussian emission distributions and capture spatial dependencies by modeling the state-specific precision matrices via graphical horseshoe priors. We characterize the mixing probabilities of the hidden process via a cumulative shrinkage prior that accommodates zero-inflated parameters for non-active components, and further incorporate a sparsity-inducing Dirichlet prior to estimate the effective number of states from the data. For posterior inference, we develop a sampling procedure that allows estimation of the number of discrete autoregressive lags and the number of states, and that cleverly avoids having to deal with the changing dimensions of the parameter space. We thoroughly investigate performance of our proposed methodology through several simulation studies. We further illustrate the use of our approach for the estimation of dynamic brain connectivity based on fMRI data collected on a subject performing a task-based experiment on latent learning</p></details> |  |

While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline model development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to domain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory management, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible workflow automation. In this paper, we introduce \textsf{TS-Agent}, a modular agentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling workflows for financial applications. The agent formalizes the pipeline as a structured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection, code refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and experimental feedback. Central to our architecture is a planner agent equipped with structured knowledge banks, curated libraries of models and refinement strategies, which guide exploration, while improving interpretability and reducing error propagation. \textsf{TS-Agent} supports adaptive learning, robust debugging, and transparent auditing, key requirements for high-stakes environments such as financial services. Empirical evaluations on diverse financial forecasting and synthetic data generation tasks demonstrate that \textsf{TS-Agent} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic baselines, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and decision traceability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Energy-Aware Time-Series Model Deployment on Embedded FPGAs for Resilient Combined Sewer Overflow Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13905v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extreme weather events, intensified by climate change, increasingly challenge aging combined sewer systems, raising the risk of untreated wastewater overflow. Accurate forecasting of sewer overflow basin filling levels can provide actionable insights for early intervention, helping mitigating uncontrolled discharge. In recent years, AI-based forecasting methods have offered scalable alternatives to traditional physics-based models, but their reliance on cloud computing limits their reliability during communication outages. To address this, we propose an end-to-end forecasting framework that enables energy-efficient inference directly on edge devices. Our solution integrates lightweight Transformer and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, compressed via integer-only quantization for efficient on-device execution. Moreover, an automated hardware-aware deployment pipeline is used to search for optimal model configurations by jointly minimizing prediction error and energy consumption on an AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 FPGA. Evaluated on real-world sewer data, the selected 8-bit Transformer model, trained on 24 hours of historical measurements, achieves high accuracy (MSE 0.0376) at an energy cost of 0.370 mJ per inference. In contrast, the optimal 8-bit LSTM model requires significantly less energy (0.009 mJ, over 40x lower) but yields 14.89% worse accuracy (MSE 0.0432) and much longer training time. This trade-off highlights the need to align model selection with deployment priorities, favoring LSTM for ultra-low energy consumption or Transformer for higher predictive accuracy. In general, our work enables local, energy-efficient forecasting, contributing to more resilient combined sewer systems. All code can be found in the GitHub Repository (https://github.com/tianheng-ling/EdgeOverflowForecast).</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, 1 table, accepted by the 11th IEEE International Smart Cities Conference</p></details> |

In this survey, we first systematically evaluate five storage architectures (Graph Databases, Multi-Model Databases, Data Lakes, Vector Databases, and Time-Series Databases), focusing on their suitability for addressing EAI's core requirements, including physical grounding, low-latency access, and dynamic scalability. We then analyze five retrieval paradigms (Fusion Strategy-Based Retrieval, Representation Alignment-Based Retrieval, Graph-Structure-Based Retrieval, Generation Model-Based Retrieval, and Efficient Retrieval-Based Optimization), revealing a fundamental tension between achieving long-term semantic coherence and maintaining real-time responsiveness. Based on this comprehensive analysis, we identify key bottlenecks, spanning from the foundational Physical Grounding Gap to systemic challenges in cross-modal integration, dynamic adaptation, and open-world generalization. Finally, we outline a forward-looking research agenda encompassing physics-aware data models, adaptive storage-retrieval co-optimization, and standardized benchmarking, to guide future research toward principled data management solutions for EAI. Our survey is based on a comprehensive review of more than 180 related studies, providing a rigorous roadmap for designing the robust, high-performance data management frameworks essential for the next generation of autonomous embodied systems.</p></details> |  |

We consider a variant, where given a set of trajectories and a number of parts, we jointly partition the set of trajectories and learn linear dynamical system (LDS) models for each part, so as to minimize the maximum error across all the models. We present globally convergent methods and EM heuristics, accompanied by promising computational results. The key highlight of this method is that it does not require a predefined hidden state dimension but instead provides an upper bound. Additionally, it offers guidance for determining regularization in the system identification.</p></details> |  |

However, current DDPM-based probabilistic time series imputation methodologies are confronted with two types of challenges: 1)\textit{The backbone modules of the denoising parts are not capable of achieving sequence modeling with low time complexity.} 2)~\textit{The architecture of denoising modules can not handle the dependencies in the time series data effectively.} To address the first challenge, we explore the potential of state space model, namely Mamba, as the backbone denoising module for DDPMs. To tackle the second challenge, we carefully devise several SSM-based blocks for time series data modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art time series imputation results on multiple real-world datasets.

| **[On the reconstruction limits of complex networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01437v3)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network reconstruction consists in retrieving the hidden interaction structure of a system from observations. Many reconstruction algorithms have been proposed, although less research has been devoted to describe their theoretical limitations. In this work, we take a first-principles approach and build on our earlier definition of reconstructability-the fraction of structural information recoverable from data. We relate this quantity to the true data-generating (TDG) process and delineate an information-theoretic reconstruction limit, i.e., the upper bound of the mutual information between the true underlying graph and any graph reconstructed from observations. These concepts lead us to a principled numerical method to assess the validity of empirically reconstructed networks, based on model selection and a quantity we introduce: the reconstruction index. This index approximates the reconstructability from data, quantifies the variability of the reconstructed network ensemble, and is shown to predict reconstruction error without requiring knowledge of the true underlying network. We characterize this method and test it on empirical time series and networks.</p></details> |  |

| **[Optimizing Highway Traffic Flow in Mixed Autonomy: A Multiagent Truncated Rollout Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19203v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offers substantial opportunities to enhance traffic efficiency. However, in mixed autonomy environments where CAVs coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs), achieving efficient coordination among CAVs remains challenging due to heterogeneous driving behaviors. To address this, this paper proposes a multiagent truncated rollout approach that enhances CAV speed coordination to improve highway throughput while reducing computational overhead. In this approach, a traffic density evolution equation is formulated that comprehensively accounts for the presence or absence of CAVs, and a distributed coordination control framework is established accordingly. By incorporating kinematic information from neighbor agents and employing an agent-by-agent sequential solution mechanism, our method enables explicit cooperation among CAVs. Furthermore, we introduce a truncated rollout scheme that adaptively shortens the optimization horizon based on the evaluation of control sequences. This significantly reduces the time complexity, thereby improving real-time performance and scalability. Theoretical analysis provides rigorous guarantees on the stability and performance improvement of the system. Simulations conducted on real-world bottleneck scenarios demonstrate that, in large-scale mixed traffic flows, the proposed method outperforms conventional model predictive control methods by reducing both the average travel time in the bottleneck area and overall computational time, highlighting its strong potential for practical deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combining Static and Dynamic Traffic with Delay Guarantees in Time-Sensitive Networking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18883v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To support reliable and low-latency communication, Time-Sensitive Networking introduced protocols and interfaces for resource allocation in Ethernet. However, the implementation of these allocation algorithms has not yet been covered by the standards. Our work focuses on deadline-guaranteeing resource allocation for networks with static and dynamic traffic. To achieve this, we combine offline network optimization heuristics with online admission control and, thus, allow for new flow registrations while the network is running. We demonstrate our solution on Credit-Based Shaper networks by using the delay analysis framework Network Calculus. We compare our approach with an intuitive and a brute-force algorithm, where we can achieve significant improvements, both, in terms of quality and runtime. Thereby, our results show that we can guarantee maximum end-to-end delays and also increase the flexibility of the network while requiring only minimal user input.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code published as DYRECTsn (https://github.com/Kathess/DYRECTsn): an open-source TSN framework for dynamic traffic with latency guarantees.

However, in complex UAV perspectives, challenges such as small target scale variations, occlusions, nonlinear crossing motions, and motion blur severely hinder the stability of multi-object tracking. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel multi-object tracking framework, SocialTrack, aimed at enhancing the tracking accuracy and robustness of small targets in complex urban traffic environments. The specialized small-target detector enhances the detection performance by employing a multi-scale feature enhancement mechanism. The Velocity Adaptive Cubature Kalman Filter (VACKF) improves the accuracy of trajectory prediction by incorporating a velocity dynamic modeling mechanism. The Group Motion Compensation Strategy (GMCS) models social group motion priors to provide stable state update references for low-quality tracks, significantly improving the target association accuracy in complex dynamic environments. Furthermore, the Spatio-Temporal Memory Prediction (STMP) leverages historical trajectory information to predict the future state of low-quality tracks, effectively mitigating identity switching issues. Extensive experiments on the UAVDT and MOT17 datasets demonstrate that SocialTrack outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across several key metrics. Significant improvements in MOTA and IDF1, among other core performance indicators, highlight its superior robustness and adaptability. Additionally, SocialTrack is highly modular and compatible, allowing for seamless integration with existing trackers to further enhance performance.</p></details> |  |

| **[Real-time Traffic Simulation and Management for Large-scale Urban Air Mobility: Integrating Route Guidance and Collision Avoidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01235v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the spatial heterogeneity of land use patterns in most cities, large-scale UAM deployments will likely focus on specific areas, such as intertransfer traffic between suburbs and city centers. However, large-scale UAM operations connecting multiple origin-destination pairs raise concerns about air traffic safety and efficiency due to potential conflict movements, particularly at major conflict points analogous to roadway junctions. To meet the safety and efficiency requirements of future UAM operations, this work proposes an air traffic management framework that integrates route guidance and collision avoidance. The route guidance mechanism optimizes aircraft distribution across both spatial and temporal dimensions by regulating their paths (composed of waypoints). Given the optimized paths, the collision avoidance algorithm generates collision-free aircraft trajectories between waypoints in the 3D space. To enable large-scale applications, we develop fast approximation methods for centralized path planning and adopt the velocity obstacle model for distributed collision avoidance. To our knowledge, this work is one of the first to integrate route guidance and collision avoidance for UAM. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework enables efficient and flexible UAM operations, including air traffic assignment, local congestion mitigation, and dynamic no-fly zone management. Compared with a collision-free baseline strategy, the proposed framework achieves considerable improvements in traffic safety and efficiency, with increases in the average minimum separation (+98.2%), the average travel speed (+70.2%), and the trip completion rate (+130%), along with a reduction in the energy consumption (-23.0%). The proposed framework demonstrates its potential for real-time traffic simulation and management in large-scale UAM systems.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[LLM-based Human-like Traffic Simulation for Self-driving Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16962v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring realistic traffic dynamics is a prerequisite for simulation platforms to evaluate the reliability of self-driving systems before deployment in the real world. Because most road users are human drivers, reproducing their diverse behaviors within simulators is vital. Existing solutions, however, typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or narrow data-driven models, which capture only fragments of real driving behaviors and offer limited driving style diversity and interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce HDSim, an HD traffic generation framework that combines cognitive theory with large language model (LLM) assistance to produce scalable and realistic traffic scenarios within simulation platforms. The framework advances the state of the art in two ways: (i) it introduces a hierarchical driver model that represents diverse driving style traits, and (ii) it develops a Perception-Mediated Behavior Influence strategy, where LLMs guide perception to indirectly shape driver actions. Experiments reveal that embedding HDSim into simulation improves detection of safety-critical failures in self-driving systems by up to 68% and yields realism-consistent accident interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cyber Orbits of Large Scale Network Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16847v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of high-performance graph libraries, such as the GraphBLAS, has enabled the analysis of massive network data sets and revealed new models for their behavior. Physical analogies for complicated network behavior can be a useful aid to understanding these newly discovered network phenomena. Prior work leveraged the canonical Gull's Lighthouse problem and developed a computational heuristic for modeling large scale network traffic using this model. A general solution using this approach requires overcoming the essential mathematical singularities in the resulting differential equations. Further investigation reveals a simpler physical interpretation that alleviates the need for solving challenging differential equations. Specifically, that the probability of observing a source at a temporal ``distance'' $r(t)$ at time $t$ is $p(t) \propto 1/r(t)^2$. This analogy aligns with many physical phenomena and can be a rich source of intuition. Applying this physical analogy to the observed source correlations in the Anonymized Network Sensing Graph Challenge data leads to an elegant cyber orbit analogy that may assist with the understanding network behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 pag...</summary><p>2 pages, 1 figure, 10 reference, to appear at IEEE HPEC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Highly Accurate and Diverse Traffic Data: The DeepScenario Open 3D Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17371v3)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 3D trajectory data is crucial for advancing autonomous driving. Yet, traditional datasets are usually captured by fixed sensors mounted on a car and are susceptible to occlusion. Additionally, such an approach can precisely reconstruct the dynamic environment in the close vicinity of the measurement vehicle only, while neglecting objects that are further away. In this paper, we introduce the DeepScenario Open 3D Dataset (DSC3D), a high-quality, occlusion-free dataset of 6 degrees of freedom bounding box trajectories acquired through a novel monocular camera drone tracking pipeline. Our dataset includes more than 175,000 trajectories of 14 types of traffic participants and significantly exceeds existing datasets in terms of diversity and scale, containing many unprecedented scenarios such as complex vehicle-pedestrian interaction on highly populated urban streets and comprehensive parking maneuvers from entry to exit. DSC3D dataset was captured in five various locations in Europe and the United States and include: a parking lot, a crowded inner-city, a steep urban intersection, a federal highway, and a suburban intersection. Our 3D trajectory dataset aims to enhance autonomous driving systems by providing detailed environmental 3D representations, which could lead to improved obstacle interactions and safety. We demonstrate its utility across multiple applications including motion prediction, motion planning, scenario mining, and generative reactive traffic agents. Our interactive online visualization platform and the complete dataset are publicly available at https://app.deepscenario.com, facilitating research in motion prediction, behavior modeling, and safety validation.</p></details> |  |

In particular, as a powerful evolutionary machine learning approach, Genetic Programming (GP) is utilized to evolve human-understandable phase urgency functions to measure the urgency of activating a green light for a specific phase. However, current GP-based methods are unable to treat the common traffic features of different traffic signal phases consistently. To address this issue, we propose to use a symmetric phase urgency function to calculate the phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. This is represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the urgency of a turn movement in the phase. We then propose a GP method to evolve the symmetric phase urgency function. We evaluate our proposed method on the well-known cityflow traffic simulator, based on multiple public real-world datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed symmetric urgency function representation can significantly improve the performance of the learned traffic signal control policies over the traditional GP representation on a wide range of scenarios. Further analysis shows that the proposed method can evolve effective, human-understandable and easily deployable traffic signal control policies.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel deep learning model, the Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph Attention Network (STGAtt). By leveraging a unified graph representation and an attention mechanism, STGAtt effectively captures complex spatial-temporal dependencies. Unlike methods relying on separate spatial and temporal dependency modeling modules, STGAtt directly models correlations within a Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph, dynamically weighing connections across both dimensions. To further enhance its capabilities, STGAtt partitions traffic flow observation signal into neighborhood subsets and employs a novel exchanging mechanism, enabling effective capture of both short-range and long-range correlations. Extensive experiments on the PEMS-BAY and SHMetro datasets demonstrate STGAtt's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines across various prediction horizons. Visualization of attention weights confirms STGAtt's ability to adapt to dynamic traffic patterns and capture long-range dependencies, highlighting its potential for real-world traffic flow forecasting applications.</p></details> |  |

The literature has effectively tackled such a problem, mostly with automated planning techniques leveraging the PDDL+ language and solvers. However, such language has limitations when it comes to specifying optimisation statements and computing optimal plans. In this paper, we provide an alternative solution to the traffic signal optimisation problem based on Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP). We devise an encoding in a CASP language, which is then solved by means of clingcon 3, a system extending the well-known ASP solver clingo. We performed experiments on real historical data from the town of Huddersfield in the UK, comparing our approach to the PDDL+ model that obtained the best results for the considered benchmark. The results showed the potential of our approach for tackling the traffic signal optimisation problem and improving the solution quality of the PDDL+ plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP), Proceedings of ICLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Digital Life of Parisian Parks: Multifunctionality and Urban Context Uncovered by Mobile Application Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15516v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Landscape architecture typically considers urban parks through the lens of form and function. While past research on equitable access has focused mainly on form, studies of functions have been constrained by limited scale and coarse measurement. Existing efforts have partially quantified functions through small-scale surveys and movement data (e.g., GPS) or general usage records (e.g., CDR), but have not captured the activities and motivations underlying park visits. As a result, our understanding of the functional roles urban parks play remains incomplete. To address this gap, we introduce a method that refines mobile base station coverage using antenna azimuths, enabling clearer distinction of mobile traffic within parks versus surrounding areas. Using Paris as a case study, we analyze a large-scale set of passively collected per-app mobile network traffic - 492 million hourly records for 45 parks. We test two hypotheses: the central-city hypothesis, which posits multifunctional parks emerge in dense, high-rent areas due to land scarcity; and the socio-spatial hypothesis, which views parks as reflections of neighborhood routines and preferences. Our analysis shows that parks have distinctive mobile traffic signatures, differing from both their surroundings and from each other. By clustering parks on temporal and app usage patterns, we identify three functional types - lunchbreak, cultural, and recreational - with different visitation motivations. Centrally located parks (cultural and lunchbreak) display more diverse app use and temporal variation, while suburban (recreational) parks reflect digital behaviors of nearby communities, with app preferences aligned to neighborhood income. These findings demonstrate the value of mobile traffic as a proxy for studying urban green space functions, with implications for park planning, public health, and well-being.</p></details> |  |

Lightweight models like MobileNet and EfficientNet, which utilize depthwise convolution for feature extraction, have been developed for these devices. However, CIM macros often face challenges in accelerating depthwise convolution, including underutilization of CIM memory and heavy buffer traffic. The latter, in particular, has been overlooked despite its significant impact on latency and energy consumption. To address this, we introduce a novel CIM dataflow that significantly reduces buffer traffic by maximizing data reuse and improving memory utilization during depthwise convolution. The proposed dataflow is grounded in solid theoretical principles, fully demonstrated in this paper. When applied to MobileNet and EfficientNet models, our dataflow reduces buffer traffic by 77.4-87.0%, leading to a total reduction in data traffic energy and latency by 10.1-17.9% and 15.6-27.8%, respectively, compared to the baseline (conventional weight-stationary dataflow).</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Computer Design</p></details> |

Adaptive routing faces two main challenges: 1) how to accurately measure/estimate time-varying traffic matrices? 2) how to control the network and application performance degradation caused by frequent route changes? In this paper, we develop a novel data-enabled predictive traffic engineering (DeeP-TE) algorithm that minimizes the network congestion by gracefully adapting routing configurations over time. Our control algorithm can generate routing updates directly from the historical routing data and the corresponding link rate data, without direct traffic matrix measurement or estimation. Numerical experiments on real network topologies with real traffic matrices demonstrate that the proposed DeeP-TE routing adaptation algorithm can achieve close-to-optimal control effectiveness with significantly lower routing variations than the baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structured Prompting and Multi-Agent Knowledge Distillation for Traffic Video Interpretation and Risk Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13439v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models (VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Although Transformer-based models offer strong global modeling, they often struggle with rigid temporal encoding and weak space-time fusion. We propose STPFormer, a Spatio-Temporal Pattern-Aware Transformer that achieves state-of-the-art performance via unified and interpretable representation learning. It integrates four modules: Temporal Position Aggregator (TPA) for pattern-aware temporal encoding, Spatial Sequence Aggregator (SSA) for sequential spatial learning, Spatial-Temporal Graph Matching (STGM) for cross-domain alignment, and an Attention Mixer for multi-scale fusion. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that STPFormer consistently sets new SOTA results, with ablation and visualizations confirming its effectiveness and generalizability.</p></details> |  |

They must be understood as unavoidable and sporadic outcomes of traffic networks. No public dataset contains 3D annotations of real-world accidents recorded from roadside camera and LiDAR sensors. We present the TUM Traffic Accid3nD (TUMTraf-Accid3nD) dataset, a collection of real-world highway accidents in different weather and lighting conditions. It contains vehicle crashes at high-speed driving with 2,634,233 labeled 2D bounding boxes, instance masks, and 3D bounding boxes with track IDs. In total, the dataset contains 111,945 labeled image and point cloud frames recorded from four roadside cameras and LiDARs at 25 Hz. The dataset contains six object classes and is provided in the OpenLABEL format. We propose an accident detection model that combines a rule-based approach with a learning-based one. Experiments and ablation studies on our dataset show the robustness of our proposed method.

This study presents a decentralized, federated learning framework tailored for traffic sign detection in vehicular networks to enable collaborative model training without sharing raw data. The framework partitioned traffic sign classes across vehicles for specialized local training using lightweight object detectors, aggregated model parameters via algorithms like FedProx, FedAdam and FedAVG in a simulated environment with the Flower framework, and evaluated multiple configurations including varying server rounds, local epochs, client participation fractions, and data distributions. Experiments demonstrated that increasing server rounds from 2 to 20 boosted accuracy from below 0.1 to over 0.8, moderate local epochs (8-10) provided optimal efficiency with accuracies around 0.67, higher client participation fractions enhanced generalization up to 0.83, FedProx outperformed other aggregators in handling heterogeneity, non-IID data distributions reduced performance compared to IID, and training duration primarily scaled with the number of rounds rather than aggregation strategy. We conclude that this federated approach may offer a scalable, privacy-preserving solution for real-world vehicular deployments, potentially guiding future integrations of robust aggregation and communication optimizations to advance intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> | 7 pages, 10 figures |
| **[RIFT: Closed-Loop RL Fine-Tuning for Realistic and Controllable Traffic Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03344v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving both realism and controllability in closed-loop traffic simulation remains a key challenge in autonomous driving. Dataset-based methods reproduce realistic trajectories but suffer from covariate shift in closed-loop deployment, compounded by simplified dynamics models that further reduce reliability. Conversely, physics-based simulation methods enhance reliable and controllable closed-loop interactions but often lack expert demonstrations, compromising realism. To address these challenges, we introduce a dual-stage AV-centric simulation framework that conducts open-loop imitation learning pre-training in a data-driven simulator to capture trajectory-level realism and route-level controllability, followed by closed-loop reinforcement learning fine-tuning in a physics-based simulator to enhance style-level controllability and mitigate covariate shift. In the fine-tuning stage, we propose RIFT, a novel RL fine-tuning strategy that evaluates all candidate modalities through group-relative optimization with a dual-clip surrogate objective, enhancing style-level controllability and mitigating covariate shift, while preserving the trajectory-level realism and route-level controllability inherited from IL pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFT improves realism and controllability in traffic simulation while simultaneously exposing the limitations of modern AV systems in closed-loop evaluation.

| **[Physics-informed deep operator network for traffic state estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12593v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic state estimation (TSE) fundamentally involves solving high-dimensional spatiotemporal partial differential equations (PDEs) governing traffic flow dynamics from limited, noisy measurements. While Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) enforce PDE constraints point-wise, this paper adopts a physics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet) framework that reformulates TSE as an operator learning problem. Our approach trains a parameterized neural operator that maps sparse input data to the full spatiotemporal traffic state field, governed by the traffic flow conservation law. Crucially, unlike PINNs that enforce PDE constraints point-wise, PI-DeepONet integrates traffic flow conservation model and the fundamental diagram directly into the operator learning process, ensuring physical consistency while capturing congestion propagation, spatial correlations, and temporal evolution. Experiments on the NGSIM dataset demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines. Further analysis reveals insights into optimal function generation strategies and branch network complexity. Additionally, the impact of input function generation methods and the number of functions on model performance is explored, highlighting the robustness and efficacy of proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review in Transportmetrica B: Transport Dynamics</p></details> |

Observing unsolicited and erroneous traffic, such as unanswered traffic or errors, is fundamental to detect misconfiguration, temporary failures or attacks. ChamaleoNet transforms any production network into a transparent monitor to let administrators collect unsolicited and erroneous traffic directed to hosts, whether offline or active, hosting a server or a client, protected by a firewall, or unused addresses. ChamaleoNet is programmed to ignore well-formed traffic and collect only erroneous packets, including those generated by misconfigured or infected internal hosts, and those sent by external actors which scan for services. Engineering such a system poses several challenges, from scalability to privacy. Leveraging the SDN paradigm, ChamaleoNet processes the traffic flowing through a campus/corporate network and focuses on erroneous packets only, lowering the pressure on the collection system while respecting privacy regulations by design. ChamaleoNet enables the seamless integration with active deceptive systems like honeypots that can impersonate unused hosts/ports/services and engage with senders. The SDN in-hardware filtering reduces the traffic to the controller by 96%, resulting in a scalable solution, which we offer as open source. Simple analytics unveil internal misconfigured and infected hosts, identify temporary failures, and enhance visibility on external radiation produced by attackers looking for vulnerable services.</p></details> | 17 pages, 16 figures |

However, existing MLLMs in this domain primarily focus on coarse-grained image-level or video-level comprehension and often struggle to handle fine-grained visual details or localized scene components, limiting their applicability in complex accident scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose SafePLUG, a novel framework that empowers MLLMs with both Pixel-Level Understanding and temporal Grounding for comprehensive traffic accident analysis. SafePLUG supports both arbitrary-shaped visual prompts for region-aware question answering and pixel-level segmentation based on language instructions, while also enabling the recognition of temporally anchored events in traffic accident scenarios. To advance the development of MLLMs for traffic accident understanding, we curate a new dataset containing multimodal question-answer pairs centered on diverse accident scenarios, with detailed pixel-level annotations and temporal event boundaries. Experimental results show that SafePLUG achieves strong performance on multiple tasks, including region-based question answering, pixel-level segmentation, temporal event localization, and accident event understanding. These capabilities lay a foundation for fine-grained understanding of complex traffic scenes, with the potential to improve driving safety and enhance situational awareness in smart transportation systems.

| **[Euclidean Approach to Green-Wave Theory Applied to Traffic Signal Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12146v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Travel on long arterials with signalized intersections can be inefficient if not coordinated properly. As the number of signals increases, coordination becomes more challenging and traditional progression schemes tend to break down. Long progressions save travel time and fuel, reduce pollution and traffic accidents by providing a smoother flow of traffic. This paper introduces a green-wave theory that can be applied to a network of intersecting arterial roads. It enables uninterrupted flow on arbitrary long signalized arterials using a Road-to-Traveler-Feedback Device. The approach is modelled after Euclid. We define concepts such as RGW-roads (roads where vehicles traveling at the recommended speed make all traffic signals), green-arrows (representing vehicle platoons), real nodes (representing signalized intersections where RGW-roads intersect) and virtual nodes, green-wave speed, blocks, etc. - the analogue of Euclid's postulates. We then use geometric reasoning to deduce results: green-arrow lengths have a maximum value, are restricted to discrete lengths, and green-arrow laws of motion imply that select existing arterial roads can be converted to RGW-roads. The signal timings and offsets that are produced have been shown to be effective using a simulation model developed previously called RGW-SIM.</p></details> | 74 pages, 49 figures |
| **[Scale-Disentangled spatiotemporal Modeling for Long-term Traffic Emission Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11923v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term traffic emission forecasting is crucial for the comprehensive management of urban air pollution. Traditional forecasting methods typically construct spatiotemporal graph models by mining spatiotemporal dependencies to predict emissions. However, due to the multi-scale entanglement of traffic emissions across time and space, these spatiotemporal graph modeling method tend to suffer from cascading error amplification during long-term inference. To address this issue, we propose a Scale-Disentangled Spatio-Temporal Modeling (SDSTM) framework for long-term traffic emission forecasting. It leverages the predictability differences across multiple scales to decompose and fuse features at different scales, while constraining them to remain independent yet complementary. Specifically, the model first introduces a dual-stream feature decomposition strategy based on the Koopman lifting operator. It lifts the scale-coupled spatiotemporal dynamical system into an infinite-dimensional linear space via Koopman operator, and delineates the predictability boundary using gated wavelet decomposition. Then a novel fusion mechanism is constructed, incorporating a dual-stream independence constraint based on cross-term loss to dynamically refine the dual-stream prediction results, suppress mutual interference, and enhance the accuracy of long-term traffic emission prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on a road-level traffic emission dataset within Xi'an's Second Ring Road demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces a curated dataset of more than 3 million people involved in accidents in Ohio over six years (2017-2022), aggregated to more than 2.3 million vehicle-level records for predictive analysis. The primary contribution is a transparent and reproducible methodology that combines Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and explainable artificial intelligence (AI) to identify and interpret key risk factors associated with severe crashes. Using the JADBio AutoML platform, predictive models were constructed to distinguish between severe and non-severe crash outcomes. The models underwent rigorous feature selection across stratified training subsets, and their outputs were interpreted using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to quantify the contribution of individual features. A final Ridge Logistic Regression model achieved an AUC-ROC of 85.6% on the training set and 84.9% on a hold-out test set, with 17 features consistently identified as the most influential predictors. Key features spanned demographic, environmental, vehicle, human, and operational categories, including location type, posted speed, minimum occupant age, and pre-crash action. Notably, certain traditionally emphasized factors, such as alcohol or drug impairment, were less influential in the final model compared to environmental and contextual variables. Emphasizing methodological rigor and interpretability over mere predictive performance, this study offers a scalable framework to support Vision Zero with aligned interventions and advanced data-informed traffic safety policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

To address this, we introduce a novel, end-to-end approach, $\texttt{AirTrafficGen}$, that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate and control the generation of complex ATC scenarios. Our method uses a purpose-built, graph-based representation to encode sector topology (including airspace geometry, routes, and fixes) into a format LLMs can process. Through rigorous benchmarking, we show that state-of-the-art models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, OpenAI o3, GPT-oss-120b and GPT-5 can generate high-traffic scenarios while maintaining operational realism. Our engineered prompting enables fine-grained control over interaction presence, type, and location. Initial findings suggest these models are also capable of iterative refinement, correcting flawed scenarios based on simple textual feedback. This approach provides a scalable alternative to manual scenario design, addressing the need for a greater volume and variety of ATC training and validation simulations. More broadly, this work showcases the potential of LLMs for complex planning in safety-critical domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages and appendices</p></details> |

However, the realism of a simulation depends extensively on the quality of input data. This paper presents an intersection traffic simulation tool that leverages real-world vehicle turning movement count (TMC) data from the City of Toronto to model traffic in an urban environment at an individual or multiple intersections using Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO). The simulation performed in this research focuses specifically on intersection-level traffic generation without creating full vehicle routes through the network. This also helps keep the network's complexity to a minimum. The simulated traffic is evaluated against actual data to show that the simulation closely reproduces real intersection flows. This validates that the real data can drive practical simulations, and these scenarios can replace synthetic or random generated data, which is prominently used in developing new traffic-related methodologies. This is the first tool to integrate TMC data from Toronto into SUMO via an easy-to-use Graphical User Interface. This work contributes to the research and traffic planning community on data-driven traffic simulation. It provides transportation engineers with a framework to evaluate intersection design and traffic signal optimization strategies using readily available aggregate traffic data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2025 21st DCOSS-IoT, Code is available at Github: https://github.com/ANTS-OntarioTechU/CrossFlow</p></details> |

To address this, we integrate a bio-inspired event camera with an RGB camera to provide high dynamic range information and propose a motion cue fusion network (MCFNet), which achieves optimal spatiotemporal alignment and adaptive cross-modal feature fusion under challenging lighting. Specifically, an event correction module (ECM) temporally aligns asynchronous event streams with image frames via optical-flow-based warping, jointly optimized with the detection network to learn task-aware event representations. The event dynamic upsampling module (EDUM) enhances spatial resolution of event frames to match image structures, ensuring precise spatiotemporal alignment. The cross-modal mamba fusion module (CMM) uses adaptive feature fusion with a novel interlaced scanning mechanism, effectively integrating complementary information for robust detection. Experiments conducted on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate that MCFNet significantly outperforms existing methods in various poor lighting and fast moving traffic scenarios. Notably, on the DSEC-Det dataset, MCFNet achieves a remarkable improvement, surpassing the best existing methods by 7.4% in mAP50 and 1.7% in mAP metrics, respectively. The code is available at https://github.com/Charm11492/MCFNet.</p></details> |  |

Participants completed six driving scenarios that combined two levels of cognitive distraction (with/without mental calculations) and three levels of driving environment complexity. Throughout the experiment, participants were free to activate or deactivate an ACC. We analyzed two gaze-based indicators of driver cognitive distraction: the percent road center, and the gaze dispersions (horizontal and vertical). Our results show that vertical gaze dispersion increases with traffic complexity, while ACC use leads to gaze concentration toward the road center. Cognitive distraction reduces road center gaze and increases vertical dispersion. Complementary analyses revealed that these observations actually arise mainly between mental calculations, while periods of mental calculations are characterized by a temporary increase in gaze concentration.</p></details> |  |

Participants drove in six scenarios, combining two levels of cognitive distraction (presence/absence of a mental calculation task) and three levels of driving environment complexity (different traffic conditions). Throughout the experiment, they were free to activate or deactivate ACC (ACC use, two levels). We analyzed three EDA-based indicators of cognitive distraction: SCL (mean skin conductance level), SCR amplitude (mean amplitude of skin conductance responses), and SCR rate (rate of skin conductance responses). Results indicate that all three indicators were significantly influenced by cognitive distraction and ACC use, while environment complexity influenced SCL and SCR amplitude, but not SCR rate. These findings suggest that EDA-based indicators reflect variations in drivers' mental workload due not only to cognitive distraction, but also to driving environment and automation use.</p></details> |  |

Although advanced Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) and pre-trained models have achieved significant progress in traffic prediction, two key challenges remain: (i) limited contextual capacity when modeling complex spatio-temporal dependencies, and (ii) low predictability at fine-grained spatio-temporal points due to heterogeneous patterns. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we propose RAST, a universal framework that integrates retrieval-augmented mechanisms with spatio-temporal modeling to address these challenges. Our framework consists of three key designs: 1) Decoupled Encoder and Query Generator to capture decoupled spatial and temporal features and construct a fusion query via residual fusion; 2) Spatio-temporal Retrieval Store and Retrievers to maintain and retrieve vectorized fine-grained patterns; and 3) Universal Backbone Predictor that flexibly accommodates pre-trained STGNNs or simple MLP predictors. Extensive experiments on six real-world traffic networks, including large-scale datasets, demonstrate that RAST achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

These limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction performance and lightweight deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Metering traffic flows for perimeter control through auction-based signalling using connected vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09678v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban traffic congestion remains a critical challenge in modern cities, with traffic signal control systems often struggling to manage congestion during peak travel times. Perimeter control of a Protected Network (PN) has emerged as a potential solution to reducing gridlock in urban networks. This paper proposes a novel auction-based mechanism for green time allocation at signalized intersections, for effective perimeter control application. Utilising a Sealed Bid, Second Price auction framework, our approach combines real-time traffic monitoring with market-inspired mechanisms to regulate vehicle inflows into PN areas. Unlike existing methods that focus primarily on gated links, our system allocates budgets to individual traffic movements, providing greater flexibility in managing multi-directional flows. We evaluate the proposed mechanism using a test case intersection with a single controlled inflow, comparing it against a volume-based fixed-time approach. The results demonstrate that our auction-based method controls flows into the PN with improved accuracy, outperforming the volume-based approach in terms of inflow regulation, queue management and delays. The framework can be applied in real time to any generic intersection, offering a scalable solution for urban traffic management. This work bridges the gap between perimeter control and market-based intersection auctions, providing a pathway for further research on adaptive traffic management systems.</p></details> |  |

The exponential growth of data collected from base stations poses significant challenges to processing and analysis. While machine learning (ML) algorithms have emerged as powerful tools for handling these large datasets and providing accurate predictions, their environmental impact, particularly in terms of energy consumption, is often overlooked in favor of their predictive capabilities. This study investigates the potential of two bio-inspired models: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Reservoir Computing through Echo State Networks (ESNs) for cellular traffic forecasting. The evaluation focuses on both their predictive performance and energy efficiency. These models are implemented in both centralized and federated settings to analyze their effectiveness and energy consumption in decentralized systems. Additionally, we compare bio-inspired models with traditional architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), to provide a comprehensive evaluation. Using data collected from three diverse locations in Barcelona, Spain, we examine the trade-offs between predictive accuracy and energy demands across these approaches. The results indicate that bio-inspired models, such as SNNs and ESNs, can achieve significant energy savings while maintaining predictive accuracy comparable to traditional architectures. Furthermore, federated implementations were tested to evaluate their energy efficiency in decentralized settings compared to centralized systems, particularly in combination with bio-inspired models. These findings offer valuable insights into the potential of bio-inspired models for sustainable and privacy-preserving cellular traffic forecasting.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

This study addresses binary VPN detection, distinguishing VPN-encrypted from non-VPN traffic using wavelet transform-based features across multiple machine learning models. Unlike previous studies focused on application-level classification within encrypted traffic, we specifically evaluate the fundamental task of VPN identification regardless of application type. We analyze the impact of wavelet decomposition levels and dataset filtering on classification performance across significantly imbalanced data, where filtering reduces some traffic categories by up to 95%. Our results demonstrate that Random Forest (RF) achieves superior performance with an F1-score of 99%, maintaining robust accuracy even after significant dataset filtering. Neural Networks (NN) show comparable effectiveness with an F1-score of 98% when trained on wavelet level 12, while Support Vector Machines (SVM) exhibit notable sensitivity to dataset reduction, with F1-scores dropping from 90% to 85% after filtering. Comparing wavelet decomposition at levels 5 and 12, we observe improved classification performance at level 12, particularly for variable traffic types, though the marginal gains may not justify the additional computational overhead. These findings establish RF as the most reliable model for VPN traffic classification while highlighting key performance tradeoffs in feature extraction and preprocessing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at SoftCOM 2025</p></details> |

Focusing resources on the causes of congestion is a potentially efficient strategy for reducing slowdowns. We present NEXICA, an algorithm to discover which parts of the highway system tend to cause slowdowns on other parts of the highway. We use time series of road speeds as inputs to our causal discovery algorithm. Finding other algorithms inadequate, we develop a new approach that is novel in three ways. First, it concentrates on just the presence or absence of events in the time series, where an event indicates the temporal beginning of a traffic slowdown. Second, we develop a probabilistic model using maximum likelihood estimation to compute the probabilities of spontaneous and caused slowdowns between two locations on the highway. Third, we train a binary classifier to identify pairs of cause/effect locations trained on pairs of road locations where we are reasonably certain a priori of their causal connections, both positive and negative. We test our approach on six months of road speed data from 195 different highway speed sensors in the Los Angeles area, showing that our approach is superior to state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and computation speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of short paper in 32nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems (ACM SIGSPATIAL 2024)</p></details> |
| **[From Micro to Macro Flow Modeling: Characterizing Heterogeneity of Mixed-Autonomy Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09432v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most autonomous-vehicles (AVs) driving strategies are designed and analyzed at the vehicle level, yet their aggregate impact on macroscopic traffic flow is still not understood, particularly the flow heterogeneity that emerges when AVs interact with human-driven vehicles (HVs). Existing validation techniques for macroscopic flow models rely on high-resolution spatiotemporal data spanning entire road segments which are rarely available for mixed-autonomy traffic. AVs record detailed Lagrangian trajectories of the ego vehicle and surrounding traffic through onboard sensors. Leveraging these Lagrangian observations to validate mixed-autonomy flow models therefore remains an open research challenge. This paper closes the gap between microscopic Lagrangian data and macroscopic Euclidean traffic models by introducing a continuous traffic-heterogeneity attribute. We represent traffic flow with two coupled conservation laws with one for vehicle number and one for the traffic attribute. Reconstruction methods are designed to derive the traffic attribute from Lagrangian vehicle trajectories. When abundant trajectory data are available, we characterize traffic heterogeneity by extracting drivers' desired speed and local behavioral uncertainty from trajectories. In data-scarce mixed traffic, we design an end-to-end mapping that infers the traffic heterogeneity solely from trajectories in the current spatiotemporal region. Experiments across multiple traffic datasets show that the proposed model effectively captures traffic heterogeneity by clustering the fundamental diagram scatter into attribute-based groups. The calibration errors of traffic flow dynamics are also reduce by 20% relative to the Aw-Rascle-Zhang model benchmark. Detailed analyses further show that the model generalizes well, maintaining nearly the same accuracy when evaluated under a variety of previously unseen traffic conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Carbon Pricing in Traffic Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09280v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic is a significant source of global carbon emissions. In this paper, we study how carbon pricing can be used to guide traffic towards equilibria that respect given emission budgets. In particular, we consider a general multi-commodity flow model with flow-dependent externalities. These externalities may represent carbon emissions, entering a priced area, or the traversal of paths regulated by tradable credit schemes. We provide a complete characterization of all flows that can be attained as Wardrop equilibria when assigning a single price to each externality. More precisely, we show that every externality budget achievable by any feasible flow in the network can also be achieved as a Wardrop equilibrium by setting appropriate prices. For extremal and Pareto-minimal budgets, we show that there are prices such that all equilibria respect the budgets. Although the proofs of existence of these particular prices rely on fixed-point arguments and are non-constructive, we show that in the case where the equilibrium minimizes a convex potential, the prices can be obtained as Lagrange multipliers of a suitable convex program. In the case of a single externality, we prove that the total externality caused by the traffic flow is decreasing in the price. For increasing, continuous, and piecewise affine travel time functions with a single externality, we give an output-polynomial algorithm that computes all equilibria implementable by pricing the externality. Even though there are networks where the output size is exponential in the input size, we show that the minimal price obeying a given budget can be computed in polynomial time. This allows the efficient computation of the market price of tradable credit schemes. Overall, our results show that carbon pricing is a viable and (under mild assumptions) tractable approach to achieve all feasible emission goals in traffic networks.</p></details> | 29 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Generalising Traffic Forecasting to Regions without Traffic Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08947v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation systems. Accurate forecasting relies on continuous observations collected by traffic sensors. However, due to high deployment and maintenance costs, not all regions are equipped with such sensors. This paper aims to forecast for regions without traffic sensors, where the lack of historical traffic observations challenges the generalisability of existing models. We propose a model named GenCast, the core idea of which is to exploit external knowledge to compensate for the missing observations and to enhance generalisation. We integrate physics-informed neural networks into GenCast, enabling physical principles to regularise the learning process. We introduce an external signal learning module to explore correlations between traffic states and external signals such as weather conditions, further improving model generalisability. Additionally, we design a spatial grouping module to filter localised features that hinder model generalisability. Extensive experiments show that GenCast consistently reduces forecasting errors on multiple real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety Perspective on Assisted Lane Changes: Insights from Open-Road, Live-Traffic Experiments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09233v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the assisted lane change functionality of five different vehicles equipped with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). The goal is to examine novel, under-researched features of commercially available ADAS technologies. The experimental campaign, conducted in the I-24 highway near Nashville, TN, US, collected data on the kinematics and safety margins of assisted lane changes in real-world conditions. The results show that the kinematics of assisted lane changes are consistent for each system, with four out of five vehicles using slower speeds and decelerations than human drivers. However, one system consistently performed more assertive lane changes, completing the maneuver in around 5 seconds. Regarding safety margins, only three vehicles are investigated. Those operated in the US are not restricted by relevant UN regulations, and their designs were found not to adhere to these regulatory requirements. A simulation method used to classify the challenge level for the vehicle receiving the lane change, showing that these systems can force trailing vehicles to decelerate to keep a safe gap. One assisted system was found to have performed a maneuver that posed a hard challenge level for the other vehicle, raising concerns about the safety of these systems in real-world operation. All three vehicles were found to carry out lane changes that induced decelerations to the vehicle in the target lane. Those decelerations could affect traffic flow, inducing traffic shockwaves.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 Figures |

The recent success of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs raises the question of how to deploy them efficiently, considering their underlying structure. During the inference in MoE LLMs, only a small part of the experts is selected to process a given token. Moreover, in practice, the experts' load is highly imbalanced. For efficient deployment, one has to distribute the model across a large number of servers using a model placement algorithm. Thus, to improve cluster utilization, the model placement algorithm has to take into account the network topology. This work focuses on the efficient topology-aware placement of the pre-trained MoE LLMs in the inference stage. We propose an integer linear program (ILP) that determines the optimal placement of experts, minimizing the expected number of transmissions. Due to the internal structure, this optimization problem can be solved with a standard ILP solver. We demonstrate that ILP-based placement strategy yields lower network traffic than competitors for small-scale (DeepSeekMoE~16B) and large-scale (DeepSeek-R1~671B) models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combat Urban Congestion via Collaboration: Heterogeneous GNN-based MARL for Coordinated Platooning and Traffic Signal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10948v3)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the years, reinforcement learning has emerged as a popular approach to develop signal control and vehicle platooning strategies either independently or in a hierarchical way. However, jointly controlling both in real-time to alleviate traffic congestion presents new challenges, such as the inherent physical and behavioral heterogeneity between signal control and platooning, as well as coordination between them. This paper proposes an innovative solution to tackle these challenges based on heterogeneous graph multi-agent reinforcement learning and traffic theories. Our approach involves: 1) designing platoon and signal control as distinct reinforcement learning agents with their own set of observations, actions, and reward functions to optimize traffic flow; 2) designing coordination by incorporating graph neural networks within multi-agent reinforcement learning to facilitate seamless information exchange among agents on a regional scale; 3) applying alternating optimization for training, allowing agents to update their own policies and adapt to other agents' policies. We evaluate our approach through SUMO simulations, which show convergent results in terms of both travel time and fuel consumption, and superior performance compared to other adaptive signal control methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Traffic Load-Aware Resource Management Strategy for Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08555v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) represent a promising technology that enables diverse underwater applications through acoustic communication. However, it encounters significant challenges including harsh communication environments, limited energy supply, and restricted signal transmission. This paper aims to provide efficient and reliable communication in underwater networks with limited energy and communication resources by optimizing the scheduling of communication links and adjusting transmission parameters (e.g., transmit power and transmission rate). The efficient and reliable communication multi-objective optimization problem (ERCMOP) is formulated as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP). A Traffic Load-Aware Resource Management (TARM) strategy based on deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is presented to address this problem. Specifically, a traffic load-aware mechanism that leverages the overhear information from neighboring nodes is designed to mitigate the disparity between partial observations and global states. Moreover, by incorporating a solution space optimization algorithm, the number of candidate solutions for the deep MARL-based decision-making model can be effectively reduced, thereby optimizing the computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the adaptability of TARM in various scenarios with different transmission demands and collision probabilities, while also validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in supporting efficient and reliable communication in underwater networks with limited resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</p></details> |

One crucial step is modeling the volume of traffic demand. But past demand modeling approaches have relied on unrealistic or suboptimal heuristics, and they have failed to adequately account for the effects of noisy and multimodal data on simulation outcomes. In this work, we integrate advances in AI to construct a three-step, end-to-end pipeline for systematically modeling traffic demand from detector data: computer vision for vehicle counting from noisy camera footage, combinatorial optimization for vehicle route generation from multimodal data, and large language models for iterative simulation refinement from natural language feedback. Using a road network from Strongsville, Ohio as a testbed, we show that our pipeline accurately captures the city's traffic patterns in a granular simulation. Beyond Strongsville, incorporating noise and multimodality makes our framework generalizable to municipalities with different levels of data and infrastructure availability.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages; 1 table; 6 figures; extended version of accepted version, published at the 2025 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC '25)</p></details> |
| **[A Physics-informed Deep Operator for Real-Time Freeway Traffic State Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08002v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic state estimation (TSE) falls methodologically into three categories: model-driven, data-driven, and model-data dual-driven. Model-driven TSE relies on macroscopic traffic flow models originated from hydrodynamics. Data-driven TSE leverages historical sensing data and employs statistical models or machine learning methods to infer traffic state. Model-data dual-driven traffic state estimation attempts to harness the strengths of both aspects to achieve more accurate TSE. From the perspective of mathematical operator theory, TSE can be viewed as a type of operator that maps available measurements of inerested traffic state into unmeasured traffic state variables in real time. For the first time this paper proposes to study real-time freeway TSE in the idea of physics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet), which is an operator-oriented architecture embedding traffic flow models based on deep neural networks. The paper has developed an extended architecture from the original PI-DeepONet. The extended architecture is featured with: (1) the acceptance of 2-D data input so as to support CNN-based computations; (2) the introduction of a nonlinear expansion layer, an attention mechanism, and a MIMO mechanism; (3) dedicated neural network design for adaptive identification of traffic flow model parameters. A traffic state estimator built on the basis of this extended PI-DeepONet architecture was evaluated with respect to a short freeway stretch of NGSIM and a large-scale urban expressway in China, along with other four baseline TSE methods. The evaluation results demonstrated that this novel TSE method outperformed the baseline methods with high-precision estimation results of flow and mean speed.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Noise-Aware Generative Microscopic Traffic Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07453v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately modeling individual vehicle behavior in microscopic traffic simulation remains a key challenge in intelligent transportation systems, as it requires vehicles to realistically generate and respond to complex traffic phenomena such as phantom traffic jams. While traditional human driver simulation models offer computational tractability, they do so by abstracting away the very complexity that defines human driving. On the other hand, recent advances in infrastructure-mounted camera-based roadway sensing have enabled the extraction of vehicle trajectory data, presenting an opportunity to shift toward generative, agent-based models. Yet, a major bottleneck remains: most existing datasets are either overly sanitized or lack standardization, failing to reflect the noisy, imperfect nature of real-world sensing. Unlike data from vehicle-mounted sensors-which can mitigate sensing artifacts like occlusion through overlapping fields of view and sensor fusion-infrastructure-based sensors surface a messier, more practical view of challenges that traffic engineers encounter. To this end, we present the I-24 MOTION Scenario Dataset (I24-MSD)-a standardized, curated dataset designed to preserve a realistic level of sensor imperfection, embracing these errors as part of the learning problem rather than an obstacle to overcome purely from preprocessing. Drawing from noise-aware learning strategies in computer vision, we further adapt existing generative models in the autonomous driving community for I24-MSD with noise-aware loss functions. Our results show that such models not only outperform traditional baselines in realism but also benefit from explicitly engaging with, rather than suppressing, data imperfection. We view I24-MSD as a stepping stone toward a new generation of microscopic traffic simulation that embraces the real-world challenges and is better aligned with practical needs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Traffic Oscillations in Mixed Traffic Flow with Scalable Deep Koopman Predictive Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00043v3)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mitigating traffic oscillations in mixed flows of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) is critical for enhancing traffic stability. A key challenge lies in modeling the nonlinear, heterogeneous behaviors of HDVs within computationally tractable predictive control frameworks. This study proposes an adaptive deep Koopman predictive control framework (AdapKoopPC) to address this issue. The framework features a novel deep Koopman network, AdapKoopnet, which represents complex HDV car-following dynamics as a linear system in a high-dimensional space by adaptively learning from naturalistic data. This learned linear representation is then embedded into a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme, enabling real-time, scalable, and optimal control of CAVs. We validate our framework using the HighD dataset and extensive numerical simulations. Results demonstrate that AdapKoopnet achieves superior trajectory prediction accuracy over baseline models. Furthermore, the complete AdapKoopPC controller significantly dampens traffic oscillations with lower computational cost, exhibiting strong performance even at low CAV penetration rates. The proposed framework offers a scalable and data-driven solution for enhancing stability in realistic mixed traffic environments. The code is made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Competition Helps: Achieving Optimal Traffic Flow with Multiple Autonomous Planners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07145v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inefficiency of selfish routing in congested networks is a classical problem in algorithmic game theory, often captured by the Price of Anarchy (i.e., the ratio between the social cost of decentralized decisions and that of a centrally optimized solution.) With the advent of autonomous vehicles, capable of receiving and executing centrally assigned routes, it is natural to ask whether their deployment can eliminate this inefficiency. At first glance, a central authority could simply compute an optimal traffic assignment and instruct each vehicle to follow its assigned path. However, this vision overlooks critical challenges: routes must be individually rational (no vehicle has an incentive to deviate), and in practice, multiple planning agents (e.g., different companies) may coexist and compete. Surprisingly, we show that such competition is not merely an obstacle but a necessary ingredient for achieving optimal outcomes. In this work, we design a routing mechanism that embraces competition and converges to an optimal assignment, starting from the classical Pigou network as a foundational case.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models are often task-oriented and are trained with tailored data, which limits their effectiveness in diverse mobile network tasks of Base Station (BS) deployment, resource allocation, energy optimization, etc. and hinders generalization across different urban environments. Foundation models have made remarkable strides across various domains of NLP and CV due to their multi-tasking adaption and zero/few-shot learning capabilities. In this paper, we propose an innovative Foundation model for Mo}bile traffic forecasting (FoMo), aiming to handle diverse forecasting tasks of short/long-term predictions and distribution generation across multiple cities to support network planning and optimization. FoMo combines diffusion models and transformers, where various spatio-temporal masks are proposed to enable FoMo to learn intrinsic features of different tasks, and a contrastive learning strategy is developed to capture the correlations between mobile traffic and urban contexts, thereby improving its transfer learning capability. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world datasets demonstrate that FoMo outperforms current models concerning diverse forecasting tasks and zero/few-shot learning, showcasing a strong universality.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, KDD 2025</p></details> |

While Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have shown benefits in modeling complex traffic dependencies, the existing GCN-based approaches cannot fully extract and fuse multi-granular spatiotemporal features across various spatial and temporal scales sufficiently in a complete manner, proven to yield less accurate results. Besides, as extracting multi-granular features across scales has been a promising strategy across domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, and time-series forecasting, pioneering studies have attempted to leverage a similar mechanism for spatiotemporal traffic data mining. However, additional feature extraction branches introduced in prior studies critically increased model complexity and extended inference time, making it challenging to provide fast forecasts. In this paper, we propose MultiGran-STGCNFog, an efficient fog distributed inference system with a novel traffic forecasting model that employs multi-granular spatiotemporal feature fusion on generated dynamic traffic graphs to fully capture interdependent traffic dynamics. The proposed scheduling algorithm GA-DPHDS, optimizing layer execution order and layer-device scheduling scheme simultaneously, contributes to considerable inference throughput improvement by coordinating heterogeneous fog devices in a pipelined manner. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over selected GCN baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 34th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2025)</p></details> |

An advertising campaign hopes to maximize the effect (such as conversions) under constraints (such as budget and cost-per-click). The mainstream control of campaigns is auto-bidding, where the performance depends on the decision of the bidding algorithm in each request. The most widely used auto-bidding algorithms include Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control, linear programming (LP), reinforcement learning (RL), etc. Existing methods either do not consider the entire time traffic, or have too high computational complexity. In this paper, the live advertising has high requirements for real-time bidding (second-level control) and faces the difficulty of unknown future traffic. Therefore, we propose a lightweight bidding algorithm Binary Constrained Bidding (BiCB), which neatly combines the optimal bidding formula given by mathematical analysis and the statistical method of future traffic estimation, and obtains good approximation to the optimal result through a low complexity solution. In addition, we complement the form of upper and lower bound constraints for traditional auto-bidding modeling and give theoretical analysis of BiCB. Sufficient offline and online experiments prove BiCB's good performance and low engineering cost.</p></details> |  |

Deep learning has advanced video-based traffic monitoring through video question answering (VideoQA) models, enabling structured insight extraction from traffic videos. However, existing VideoQA models struggle with the complexity of real-world traffic scenes, where multiple concurrent events unfold across spatiotemporal dimensions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \textbf{InterAct VideoQA}, a curated dataset designed to benchmark and enhance VideoQA models for traffic monitoring tasks. The InterAct VideoQA dataset comprises 8 hours of real-world traffic footage collected from diverse intersections, segmented into 10-second video clips, with over 25,000 question-answer (QA) pairs covering spatiotemporal dynamics, vehicle interactions, incident detection, and other critical traffic attributes. State-of-the-art VideoQA models are evaluated on InterAct VideoQA, exposing challenges in reasoning over fine-grained spatiotemporal dependencies within complex traffic scenarios. Additionally, fine-tuning these models on InterAct VideoQA yields notable performance improvements, demonstrating the necessity of domain-specific datasets for VideoQA. InterAct VideoQA is publicly available as a benchmark dataset to facilitate future research in real-world deployable VideoQA models for intelligent transportation systems.

Existing work either assumes all locations are equipped with sensors or focuses on short-term forecast. This paper studies partial sensing forecast of long-term traffic, assuming sensors are available only at some locations. The problem is challenging due to the unknown data distribution at unsensed locations, the intricate spatio-temporal correlation in long-term forecasting, as well as noise to traffic patterns. We propose a Spatio-temporal Long-term Partial sensing Forecast model (SLPF) for traffic prediction, with several novel contributions, including a rank-based embedding technique to reduce the impact of noise in data, a spatial transfer matrix to overcome the spatial distribution shift from sensed locations to unsensed locations, and a multi-step training process that utilizes all available data to successively refine the model parameters for better accuracy. Extensive experiments on several real-world traffic datasets demonstrate its superior performance.

However, accurate forecasting is difficult due to intricate spatial and temporal patterns that exist due to the mobility of users. Existing AI-based traffic forecasting models often trade-off accuracy and computational efficiency. We present Hierarchical SpatioTemporal Mamba (HiSTM), which combines a dual spatial encoder with a Mamba-based temporal module and attention mechanism. HiSTM employs selective state space methods to capture spatial and temporal patterns in network traffic. In our evaluation, we use a real-world dataset to compare HiSTM against several baselines, showing a 29.4% MAE improvement over the STN baseline while using 94% fewer parameters. We show that the HiSTM generalizes well across different datasets and improves in accuracy over longer time-horizons.</p></details> |  |
| **[Channel-Independent Federated Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04517v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, traffic prediction has achieved remarkable success and has become an integral component of intelligent transportation systems. However, traffic data is typically distributed among multiple data owners, and privacy constraints prevent the direct utilization of these isolated datasets for traffic prediction. Most existing federated traffic prediction methods focus on designing communication mechanisms that allow models to leverage information from other clients in order to improve prediction accuracy. Unfortunately, such approaches often incur substantial communication overhead, and the resulting transmission delays significantly slow down the training process. As the volume of traffic data continues to grow, this issue becomes increasingly critical, making the resource consumption of current methods unsustainable. To address this challenge, we propose a novel variable relationship modeling paradigm for federated traffic prediction, termed the Channel-Independent Paradigm(CIP). Unlike traditional approaches, CIP eliminates the need for inter-client communication by enabling each node to perform efficient and accurate predictions using only local information. Based on the CIP, we further develop Fed-CI, an efficient federated learning framework, allowing each client to process its own data independently while effectively mitigating the information loss caused by the lack of direct data sharing among clients. Fed-CI significantly reduces communication overhead, accelerates the training process, and achieves state-of-the-art performance while complying with privacy regulations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that Fed-CI consistently outperforms existing methods across all datasets and federated settings. It achieves improvements of 8%, 14%, and 16% in RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, respectively, while also substantially reducing communication costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reconstructing Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Traffic Flow Modeling: a Multi-Gradient Descent and Pareto Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13241v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is crucial in modern traffic flow modeling because it combines the benefits of both physics-based and data-driven approaches. In conventional PIML, physical information is typically incorporated by constructing a hybrid loss function that combines data-driven loss and physics loss through linear scalarization. The goal is to find a trade-off between these two objectives to improve the accuracy of model predictions. However, from a mathematical perspective, linear scalarization is limited to identifying only the convex region of the Pareto front, as it treats data-driven and physics losses as separate objectives. Given that most PIML loss functions are non-convex, linear scalarization restricts the achievable trade-off solutions. Moreover, tuning the weighting coefficients for the two loss components can be both time-consuming and computationally challenging. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a paradigm shift in PIML by reformulating the training process as a multi-objective optimization problem, treating data-driven loss and physics loss independently. We apply several multi-gradient descent algorithms (MGDAs), including traditional multi-gradient descent (TMGD) and dual cone gradient descent (DCGD), to explore the Pareto front in this multi-objective setting. These methods are evaluated on both macroscopic and microscopic traffic flow models. In the macroscopic case, MGDAs achieved comparable performance to traditional linear scalarization methods. Notably, in the microscopic case, MGDAs significantly outperformed their scalarization-based counterparts, demonstrating the advantages of a multi-objective optimization approach in complex PIML scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Given the prohibitive computational cost of learning individual policies for each intersection, some researchers explore learning a universal policy to control each intersection in a decentralized manner, where the key challenge is to construct a universal representation method for heterogeneous intersections. However, existing methods are limited to universally representing information of heterogeneous ego intersections, neglecting the essential representation of influence from their heterogeneous neighbors. Universally incorporating neighborhood information is nontrivial due to the intrinsic complexity of traffic flow interactions, as well as the challenge of modeling collective influences from neighbor intersections. To address these challenges, we propose CityLight, which learns a universal policy based on representations obtained with two major modules: a Neighbor Influence Encoder to explicitly model neighbor's influence with specified traffic flow relation and connectivity to the ego intersection; a Neighbor Influence Aggregator to attentively aggregate the influence of neighbors based on their mutual competitive relations. Extensive experiments on five city-scale datasets, ranging from 97 to 13,952 intersections, confirm the efficacy of CityLight, with an average throughput improvement of 11.68% and a lift of 22.59% for generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |

While most existing attacks exploit ML techniques for discovering such traffic patterns, they underperform on wireless traffic, especially Wi-Fi, due to its heavy noise and packet losses of wireless sniffing. In addition, these approaches commonly target at distinguishing chunked IoT event traffic samples, and they failed at effectively tracking multiple events simultaneously. In this work, we propose WiFinger, a fine-grained multi-IoT event fingerprinting approach against noisy traffic. WiFinger turns the traffic pattern classification task into a subsequence matching problem and introduces novel techniques to account for the high time complexity while maintaining high accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on Wi-Fi traffic, achieving an average recall of 85% (vs. 0.49% and 0.46%) for various IoT events while maintaining almost zero false positives for most of them.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIDAR: Mimicking LiDAR Detection for Traffic Applications with a Lightweight Plug-and-Play Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02858v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As autonomous driving (AD) technology advances, increasing research has focused on leveraging cooperative perception (CP) data collected from multiple AVs to enhance traffic applications. Due to the impracticality of large-scale real-world AV deployments, simulation has become the primary approach in most studies. While game-engine-based simulators like CARLA generate high-fidelity raw sensor data (e.g., LiDAR point clouds) which can be used to produce realistic detection outputs, they face scalability challenges in multi-AV scenarios. In contrast, microscopic traffic simulators such as SUMO scale efficiently but lack perception modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we propose MIDAR, a LiDAR detection mimicking model that approximates realistic LiDAR detections using vehicle-level features readily available from microscopic traffic simulators. Specifically, MIDAR predicts true positives (TPs) and false negatives (FNs) from ideal LiDAR detection results based on the spatial layouts and dimensions of surrounding vehicles. A Refined Multi-hop Line-of-Sight (RM-LoS) graph is constructed to encode the occlusion relationships among vehicles, upon which MIDAR employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP architecture to propagate features from the ego AV and occluding vehicles to the prediction target. MIDAR achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating the detection results generated by CenterPoint, a mainstream 3D LiDAR detection model, on the nuScenes AD dataset. Two CP-based traffic applications further validate the necessity of such realistic detection modeling, particularly for tasks requiring accurate individual vehicle observations (e.g., position, speed, lane index). As demonstrated in the applications, MIDAR can be seamlessly integrated into traffic simulators and trajectory datasets and will be open-sourced upon publication.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |

In this paper, we introduce Traffic-R1, a foundation model with human-like reasoning for TSC systems. Our model is developed through self-exploration and iteration of reinforced large language models (LLMs) with expert guidance in a simulated traffic environment. Compared to traditional reinforcement learning (RL) and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers three significant advantages. First, Traffic-R1 delivers zero-shot generalisation, transferring unchanged to new road networks and out-of-distribution incidents by utilizing its internal traffic control policies and human-like reasoning. Second, its 3B-parameter architecture is lightweight enough for real-time inference on mobile-class chips, enabling large-scale edge deployment. Third, Traffic-R1 provides an explainable TSC process and facilitates multi-intersection communication through its self-iteration and a new synchronous communication network. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that Traffic-R1 sets a new state of the art, outperforming strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In practice, the model now manages signals for more than 55,000 drivers daily, shortening average queues by over 5% and halving operator workload.

| **[Distillation-Enhanced Clustering Acceleration for Encrypted Traffic Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02282v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic classification plays a significant role in network service management. The advancement of deep learning has established pretrained models as a robust approach for this task. However, contemporary encrypted traffic classification systems face dual limitations. Firstly, pretrained models typically exhibit large-scale architectures, where their extensive parameterization results in slow inference speeds and high computational latency. Secondly, reliance on labeled data for fine-tuning restricts these models to predefined supervised classes, creating a bottleneck when novel traffic types emerge in the evolving Internet landscape. To address these challenges, we propose NetClus, a novel framework integrating pretrained models with distillation-enhanced clustering acceleration. During fine-tuning, NetClus first introduces a cluster-friendly loss to jointly reshape the latent space for both classification and clustering. With the fine-tuned model, it distills the model into a lightweight Feed-Forward Neural Network model to retain semantics. During inference, NetClus performs heuristic merge with near-linear runtime, and valid the cluster purity with newly proposed metrics ASI to identify emergent traffic types while expediting classification. Benchmarked against existing pretrained methods, NetClus achieves up to 6.2x acceleration while maintaining classification degradation below 1%.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Real-Time Conflict Prediction for Large Truck Merging in Mixed Traffic at Work Zone Lane Closures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02109v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large trucks substantially contribute to work zone-related crashes, primarily due to their large size and blind spots. When approaching a work zone, large trucks often need to merge into an adjacent lane because of lane closures caused by construction activities. This study aims to enhance the safety of large truck merging maneuvers in work zones by evaluating the risk associated with merging conflicts and establishing a decision-making strategy for merging based on this risk assessment. To predict the risk of large trucks merging into a mixed traffic stream within a work zone, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is employed. For a large truck intending to merge, it is critical that the immediate downstream vehicle in the target lane maintains a minimum safe gap to facilitate a safe merging process. Once a conflict-free merging opportunity is predicted, large trucks are instructed to merge in response to the lane closure. Our LSTM-based conflict prediction method is compared against baseline approaches, which include probabilistic risk-based merging, 50th percentile gap-based merging, and 85th percentile gap-based merging strategies. The results demonstrate that our method yields a lower conflict risk, as indicated by reduced Time Exposed Time-to-Collision (TET) and Time Integrated Time-to-Collision (TIT) values relative to the baseline models. Furthermore, the findings indicate that large trucks that use our method can perform early merging while still in motion, as opposed to coming to a complete stop at the end of the current lane prior to closure, which is commonly observed with the baseline approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Traffic Scene Generation from Natural Language Description for Autonomous Vehicles with Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09575v3)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating realistic and controllable traffic scenes from natural language can greatly enhance the development and evaluation of autonomous driving systems. However, this task poses unique challenges: (1) grounding free-form text into spatially valid and semantically coherent layouts, (2) composing scenarios without predefined locations, and (3) planning multi-agent behaviors and selecting roads that respect agents' configurations. To address these, we propose a modular framework, TTSG, comprising prompt analysis, road retrieval, agent planning, and a novel plan-aware road ranking algorithm to solve these challenges. While large language models (LLMs) are used as general planners, our design integrates them into a tightly controlled pipeline that enforces structure, feasibility, and scene diversity. Notably, our ranking strategy ensures consistency between agent actions and road geometry, enabling scene generation without predefined routes or spawn points. The framework supports both routine and safety-critical scenarios, as well as multi-stage event composition. Experiments on SafeBench demonstrate that our method achieves the lowest average collision rate (3.5\%) across three critical scenarios. Moreover, driving captioning models trained on our generated scenes improve action reasoning by over 30 CIDEr points. These results underscore our proposed framework for flexible, interpretable, and safety-oriented simulation.</p></details> |  |

Widely used datasets, such as Mapillary, often provide only coarse-grained labels - without distinguishing semantically important types such as stop signs or speed limit signs. To this end, we present a new validation set for traffic signs derived from the Mapillary dataset called Mapillary Vistas Validation for Traffic Signs (MVV), where we decompose composite traffic signs into granular, semantically meaningful categories. The dataset includes pixel-level instance masks and has been manually annotated by expert annotators to ensure label fidelity. Further, we benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs against the self-supervised DINOv2 model on this dataset and show that DINOv2 consistently outperforms all VLM baselines-not only on traffic sign recognition, but also on heavily represented categories like vehicles and humans. Our analysis reveals significant limitations in current vision-language models for fine-grained visual understanding and establishes DINOv2 as a strong baseline for dense semantic matching in autonomous driving scenarios. This dataset and evaluation framework pave the way for more reliable, interpretable, and scalable perception systems.

Network traffic classification(ETC) can analyzes attributes such as application categories and malicious intent, supporting network management services like QoS optimization, intrusion detection, and targeted billing. As the prevalence of traffic encryption increases, deep learning models are relied upon for content-agnostic analysis of packet sequences. However, the emergence of new services and attack variants often leads to incremental tasks for ETC models. To ensure model effectiveness, incremental learning techniques are essential; however, recent studies indicate that neural networks experience declining plasticity as tasks increase. We identified plasticity issues in existing incremental learning methods across diverse traffic samples and proposed the PRIME framework. By observing the effective rank of model parameters and the proportion of inactive neurons, the PRIME architecture can appropriately increase the parameter scale when the model's plasticity deteriorates. Experiments show that in multiple encrypted traffic datasets and different category increment scenarios, the PRIME architecture performs significantly better than other incremental learning algorithms with minimal increase in parameter scale.</p></details> |  |

To reduce reliance on handcrafted features and labeled data, recent methods focus on learning generic representations through pre-training on large-scale unlabeled data. However, current pre-trained models face two limitations originating from the adopted Transformer architecture: (1) Limited model efficiency due to the self-attention mechanism with quadratic complexity; (2) Unstable traffic scalability to longer byte sequences, as the explicit positional encodings fail to generalize to input lengths not seen during pre-training. In this paper, we investigate whether convolutions, with linear complexity and implicit positional encoding, are competitive with Transformers in encrypted traffic classification with pre-training. We first conduct a systematic comparison, and observe that convolutions achieve higher efficiency and scalability, with lower classification performance. To address this trade-off, we propose NetConv, a novel pre-trained convolution model for encrypted traffic classification. NetConv employs stacked traffic convolution layers, which enhance the ability to capture localized byte-sequence patterns through window-wise byte scoring and sequence-wise byte gating. We design a continuous byte masking pre-training task to help NetConv learn protocol-specific patterns. Experimental results on four tasks demonstrate that NetConv improves average classification performance by 6.88% and model throughput by 7.41X over existing pre-trained models.</p></details> | Under review |

Many existing approaches adopt an SQL-based paradigm for querying such large-scale video databases; however, this constrains queries to rigid patterns with predefined semantic categories, significantly limiting analytical flexibility. In this work, we explore a language-driven video analytics paradigm aimed at enabling flexible and efficient querying of high-volume video data driven by natural language. Particularly, we build \textsc{Lava}, a system that accepts natural language queries and retrieves traffic targets across multiple levels of granularity and arbitrary categories. \textsc{Lava} comprises three main components: 1) a multi-armed bandit-based efficient sampling method for video segment-level localization; 2) a video-specific open-world detection module for object-level retrieval; and 3) a long-term object trajectory extraction scheme for temporal object association, yielding complete trajectories for object-of-interests. To support comprehensive evaluation, we further develop a novel benchmark by providing diverse, semantically rich natural language predicates and fine-grained annotations for multiple videos. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that \textsc{Lava} improves $F_1$-scores for selection queries by $\mathbf{14\%}$, reduces MPAE for aggregation queries by $\mathbf{0.39}$, and achieves top-$k$ precision of $\mathbf{86\%}$, while processing videos $ \mathbf{9.6\times} $ faster than the most accurate baseline.

It is an important problem in intelligent transportation systems, with a plethora of methods been proposed. Existing efforts mainly focus on capturing and utilizing spatio-temporal dependencies to predict future traffic flows. Though promising, they fall short in adapting to test-time environmental changes of traffic conditions. To tackle this challenge, we propose to introduce large language models (LLMs) to help traffic flow forecasting and design a novel method named Large Language Model Enhanced Traffic Flow Predictor (LEAF). LEAF adopts two branches, capturing different spatio-temporal relations using graph and hypergraph structures respectively. The two branches are first pre-trained individually, and during test-time, they yield different predictions. Based on these predictions, a large language model is used to select the most likely result. Then, a ranking loss is applied as the learning objective to enhance the prediction ability of the two branches. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LEAF.</p></details> | Accepted by ACL 2025 |

Nevertheless, the telecom industry still heavily relies on manual expert intervention. Existing studies have been focused on exhaustively explore the spatial-temporal correlations. However, they often overlook the underlying characteristics of cellular traffic, which are shaped by the sporadic and bursty nature of telecom services. Additionally, concept drift creates substantial obstacles to maintaining satisfactory accuracy in continuous cellular forecasting tasks. To resolve these problems, we put forward an online cellular traffic prediction method grounded in Multi-Grained Spatial-Temporal feature Complementarity (MGSTC). The proposed method is devised to achieve high-precision predictions in practical continuous forecasting scenarios. Concretely, MGSTC segments historical data into chunks and employs the coarse-grained temporal attention to offer a trend reference for the prediction horizon. Subsequently, fine-grained spatial attention is utilized to capture detailed correlations among network elements, which enables localized refinement of the established trend. The complementarity of these multi-grained spatial-temporal features facilitates the efficient transmission of valuable information. To accommodate continuous forecasting needs, we implement an online learning strategy that can detect concept drift in real-time and promptly switch to the appropriate parameter update stage. Experiments carried out on four real-world datasets demonstrate that MGSTC outperforms eleven state-of-the-art baselines consistently.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ACM TKDD. 26 pages, 12 figures,</p></details> |

In reality, internet traffic is non-Markovian, and past states do influence routing performance. Moreover, common deep RL approaches use function approximators, such as neural networks, that do not model the spatial structure in network topologies. To address these shortcomings, we design a network environment with non-Markovian traffic and introduce a spatial-temporal RL (STRL) framework for packet routing. Our approach outperforms traditional baselines by more than 19% during training and 7% for inference despite a change in network topology.</p></details> |  |
| **[EP-Diffuser: An Efficient Diffusion Model for Traffic Scene Generation and Prediction via Polynomial Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05422v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the prediction horizon increases, predicting the future evolution of traffic scenes becomes increasingly difficult due to the multi-modal nature of agent motion. Most state-of-the-art (SotA) prediction models primarily focus on forecasting the most likely future. However, for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles, it is equally important to cover the distribution for plausible motion alternatives. To address this, we introduce EP-Diffuser, a novel parameter-efficient diffusion-based generative model designed to capture the distribution of possible traffic scene evolutions. Conditioned on road layout and agent history, our model acts as a predictor and generates diverse, plausible scene continuations. We benchmark EP-Diffuser against two SotA models in terms of accuracy and plausibility of predictions on the Argoverse 2 dataset. Despite its significantly smaller model size, our approach achieves both highly accurate and plausible traffic scene predictions. We further evaluate model generalization ability in an out-of-distribution (OoD) test setting using Waymo Open dataset and show superior robustness of our approach.

Current technologies face two significant challenges: first, the traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution, resulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional convolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution classes; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small targets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract multi-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage framework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. For traffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable vision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to specifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For traffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal Contrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a Vision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL learns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating class confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method achieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for all-class recognition. The model also obtains 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall, significantly outperforming mainstream algorithms and demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization in complex, open-world scenarios.</p></details> | 11pages, 5 figures |

However, existing traffic simulation methods face challenges in their controllability. To address this, we propose a novel diffusion-based and LLM-enhanced traffic simulation framework. Our approach incorporates a high-level understanding module and a low-level refinement module, which systematically examines the hierarchical structure of traffic elements, guides LLMs to thoroughly analyze traffic scenario descriptions step by step, and refines the generation by self-reflection, enhancing their understanding of complex situations. Furthermore, we propose a Frenet-frame-based cost function framework that provides LLMs with geometrically meaningful quantities, improving their grasp of spatial relationships in a scenario and enabling more accurate cost function generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) demonstrate that our method can handle more intricate descriptions and generate a broader range of scenarios in a controllable manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |

Nevertheless, the complete potential of Green Wave systems has yet to be explored. Utilizing emerging technologies and advanced algorithms, such as AI or V2X, would aid in achieving more robust traffic management strategies, especially when integrated with Green Wave. This work comprehensively surveys existing traffic control strategies that enable Green Waves and analyzes their impact on future traffic management systems and urban infrastructure. Understanding previous research on traffic management and its effect on traffic efficiency and safety helps explore the integration of Green Wave solutions with smart city initiatives for effective traffic signal coordination. This paper also discusses the advantages of using Green Wave strategies for emission reduction and considers road safety issues for vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians and cyclists. Finally, the existing challenges and research gaps in building robust and successful Green Wave systems are discussed to articulate explicitly the future requirement of sustainable urban transport.</p></details> |  |

Autonomous driving technologies have emerged as a potential solution. Among traffic control methods, reinforcement learning has shown superior performance over traffic signals in various scenarios. However, prior research has largely focused on small-scale networks or isolated intersections, leaving large-scale mixed traffic control largely unexplored. This study presents the first attempt to use decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning for large-scale mixed traffic control in which some intersections are managed by traffic signals and others by robot vehicles. Evaluating a real-world network in Colorado Springs, CO, USA with 14 intersections, we measure traffic efficiency via average waiting time of vehicles at intersections and the number of vehicles reaching their destinations within a time window (i.e., throughput). At 80% RV penetration rate, our method reduces waiting time from 6.17s to 5.09s and increases throughput from 454 vehicles per 500 seconds to 493 vehicles per 500 seconds, outperforming the baseline of fully signalized intersections. These findings suggest that integrating reinforcement learning-based control large-scale traffic can improve overall efficiency and may inform future urban planning strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2025</p></details> |

However, as System Optimum makes some drivers better off than others, voluntary acceptance seems dubious. To overcome this issue, we propose a new concept of Wardropian cycles, which, in contrast to previous utopian visions, makes the assignment fair on top of being optimal, which amounts to satisfaction of both Wardrop's principles. Such cycles, represented as sequences of permutations to the daily assignment matrices, always exist and equalise, after a limited number of days, average travel times among travellers (like in User Equilibrium) while preserving everyday optimality of path flows (like in System Optimum). We propose exact methods to compute such cycles and reduce their length and within-cycle inconvenience to the users. As identification of optimal cycles turns out to be NP-hard in many aspects, we introduce a greedy heuristic efficiently approximating the optimal solution. Finally, we introduce and discuss a new paradigm of Cyclical User Equilibrium, which ensures stability of optimal Wardropian Cycles under unilateral deviations. We complement our theoretical study with large-scale simulations. In Barcelona, 670 vehicle-hours of Price-of-Anarchy are eliminated using cycles with a median length of 11 days-though 5% of cycles exceed 90 days. However, in Berlin, just five days of applying the greedy assignment rule significantly reduces initial inequity. In Barcelona, Anaheim, and Sioux Falls, less than 7% of the initial inequity remains after 10 days, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach in improving traffic performance with more ubiquitous social acceptability.</p></details> |  |

Recent LiDAR scene flow models utilize the rigid-motion assumption at the instance level, assuming objects are rigid bodies. However, these instance-level methods are not suitable for sparse radar point clouds. In this work, we present a novel Traffic-Aware Radar Scene-Flow (TARS) estimation method, which utilizes motion rigidity at the traffic level. To address the challenges in radar scene flow, we perform object detection and scene flow jointly and boost the latter. We incorporate the feature map from the object detector, trained with detection losses, to make radar scene flow aware of the environment and road users. From this, we construct a Traffic Vector Field (TVF) in the feature space to achieve holistic traffic-level scene understanding in our scene flow branch. When estimating the scene flow, we consider both point-level motion cues from point neighbors and traffic-level consistency of rigid motion within the space. TARS outperforms the state of the art on a proprietary dataset and the View-of-Delft dataset, improving the benchmarks by 23% and 15%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task, which aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using limited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task. This framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the Lane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies and distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained lane traffic states. Based on existing research, we designed several baseline models with the potential to solve the FRTI task and conducted extensive experiments on six datasets representing different road conditions to validate the effectiveness of the RoadDiff model in addressing the FRTI task.

However, the dynamic traffic flow forecasting is a highly nonlinear problem with complex temporal-spatial dependencies. Although the existing methods has provided great contributions to mine the temporal-spatial patterns in the complex traffic networks, they fail to encode the globally temporal-spatial patterns and are prone to overfit on the pre-defined geographical correlations, and thus hinder the model's robustness on the complex traffic environment. To tackle this issue, in this work, we proposed a multi-grained temporal-spatial graph learning framework to adaptively augment the globally temporal-spatial patterns obtained from a crafted graph transformer encoder with the local patterns from the graph convolution by a crafted gated fusion unit with residual connection techniques. Under these circumstances, our proposed model can mine the hidden global temporal-spatial relations between each monitor stations and balance the relative importance of local and global temporal-spatial patterns. Experiment results demonstrate the strong representation capability of our proposed method and our model consistently outperforms other strong baselines on various real-world traffic networks.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches often hinge on predefined driver models, objective optimization, or reliance on pre-recorded driving datasets, imposing limitations on their scalability, versatility, and adaptability. In this paper, we introduce TrafficMCTS, an innovative framework that harnesses the synergy of group-based Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and Social Value Orientation (SVO) to engender a multifaceted traffic flow with varying driving styles and cooperative tendencies.

While the abundance of data has fueled significant breakthroughs, particularly in machine learning-based methods, it also raises concerns regarding privacy, cybersecurity, and data freshness. These issues can erode public trust in intelligent transportation systems. Recently, regulations have introduced the "right to be forgotten", allowing users to request the removal of their private data from models. As machine learning models can remember old data, simply removing it from back-end databases is insufficient in such systems. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel learning paradigm for TSEP-Machine Unlearning TSEP-which enables a trained TSEP model to selectively forget privacy-sensitive, poisoned, or outdated data. By empowering models to "unlearn," we aim to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of data-driven traffic TSEP.</p></details> |  |
| **[LSDM: LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model for Service-Level Mobile Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17795v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Service-level mobile traffic prediction for individual users is essential for network efficiency and quality of service enhancement. However, current prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model (LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions, showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in terms of the coefficient of determination.

We propose Ctx2TrajGen, a context-aware trajectory generation framework that synthesizes realistic urban driving behaviors using GAIL. Leveraging PPO and WGAN-GP, our model addresses nonlinear interdependencies and training instability inherent in microscopic settings. By explicitly conditioning on surrounding vehicles and road geometry, Ctx2TrajGen generates interaction-aware trajectories aligned with real-world context.

| **[Cross-domain Multi-step Thinking: Zero-shot Fine-grained Traffic Sign Recognition in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01534v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we propose Cross-domain Multi-step Thinking (CdMT) to improve zero-shot fine-grained traffic sign recognition (TSR) performance in the wild. Zero-shot fine-grained TSR in the wild is challenging due to the cross-domain problem between clean template traffic signs and real-world counterparts, and existing approaches particularly struggle with cross-country TSR scenarios, where traffic signs typically differ between countries. The proposed CdMT framework tackles these challenges by leveraging the multi-step reasoning capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs). We introduce context, characteristic, and differential descriptions to design multiple thinking processes for LMMs. Context descriptions, which are enhanced by center coordinate prompt optimization, enable the precise localization of target traffic signs in complex road images and filter irrelevant responses via novel prior traffic sign hypotheses. Characteristic descriptions, which are derived from in-context learning with template traffic signs, bridge cross-domain gaps and enhance fine-grained TSR. Differential descriptions refine the multimodal reasoning ability of LMMs by distinguishing subtle differences among similar signs. CdMT is independent of training data and requires only simple and uniform instructions, enabling it to achieve cross-country TSR. We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and two real-world datasets from different countries. The proposed CdMT framework achieved superior performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods on all five datasets, with recognition accuracies of 0.93, 0.89, 0.97, 0.89, and 0.85 on the GTSRB, BTSD, TT-100K, Sapporo, and Yokohama datasets, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published by Knowledge-Based Systems</p></details> |

While existing RL-based methods demonstrate effectiveness in reducing vehicular congestion, their predominant focus on vehicle-centric optimization leaves pedestrian mobility needs and safety challenges unaddressed. In this paper, we present a deep RL framework for adaptive control of eight traffic signals along a real-world urban corridor, jointly optimizing both pedestrian and vehicular efficiency. Our single-agent policy is trained using real-world pedestrian and vehicle demand data derived from Wi-Fi logs and video analysis. The results demonstrate significant performance improvements over traditional fixed-time signals, reducing average wait times per pedestrian and per vehicle by up to 67% and 52% respectively, while simultaneously decreasing total wait times for both groups by up to 67% and 53%. Additionally, our results demonstrate generalization capabilities across varying traffic demands, including conditions entirely unseen during training, validating RL's potential for developing transportation systems that serve all road users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2025</p></details> |

All of them promise astonishing performance in encrypted traffic classification (up to 98% accuracy). In this paper, with a networking expert mindset, we critically reassess their performance. Through extensive analysis, we demonstrate that the reported successes are heavily influenced by data preparation problems, which allow these models to find easy shortcuts - spurious correlation between features and labels - during fine-tuning that unrealistically boost their performance. When such shortcuts are not present - as in real scenarios - these models perform poorly. We also introduce Pcap-Encoder, an LM-based representation learning model that we specifically design to extract features from protocol headers. Pcap-Encoder appears to be the only model that provides an instrumental representation for traffic classification. Yet, its complexity questions its applicability in practical settings. Our findings reveal flaws in dataset preparation and model training, calling for a better and more conscious test design. We propose a correct evaluation methodology and stress the need for rigorous benchmarking.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at ACM SIGCOMM 2025.

To address this growing concern, we introduce Beacon, a naturalistic driving dataset capturing traffic dynamics during blackouts at two major intersections in Memphis, TN, USA. The dataset provides detailed traffic movements, including timesteps, origin, and destination lanes for each vehicle over four hours of peak periods. We analyze traffic demand, vehicle trajectories, and density across different scenarios, demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction under unsignalized, signalized, and mixed traffic conditions. We find that integrating robot vehicles (RVs) into traffic flow can substantially reduce intersection delays, with wait time improvements of up to 82.6%. However, this enhanced traffic efficiency comes with varying environmental impacts, as decreased vehicle idling may lead to higher overall CO2 emissions. To the best of our knowledge, Beacon is the first publicly available traffic dataset for naturalistic driving behaviors during blackouts at intersections.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2025</p></details> |

| **[Quantum Graph Attention Network: A Novel Quantum Multi-Head Attention Mechanism for Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17630v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose the Quantum Graph Attention Network (QGAT), a hybrid graph neural network that integrates variational quantum circuits into the attention mechanism. At its core, QGAT employs strongly entangling quantum circuits with amplitude-encoded node features to enable expressive nonlinear interactions. Distinct from classical multi-head attention that separately computes each head, QGAT leverages a single quantum circuit to simultaneously generate multiple attention coefficients. This quantum parallelism facilitates parameter sharing across heads, substantially reducing computational overhead and model complexity. Classical projection weights and quantum circuit parameters are optimized jointly in an end-to-end manner, ensuring flexible adaptation to learning tasks. Empirical results demonstrate QGAT's effectiveness in capturing complex structural dependencies and improved generalization in inductive scenarios, highlighting its potential for scalable quantum-enhanced learning across domains such as chemistry, biology, and network analysis. Furthermore, experiments confirm that quantum embedding enhances robustness against feature and structural noise, suggesting advantages in handling real-world noisy data. The modularity of QGAT also ensures straightforward integration into existing architectures, allowing it to easily augment classical attention-based models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Network-Based Topology Optimization for Self-Supporting Structures in Additive Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19169v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a machine learning-based framework for topology optimization of self-supporting structures, specifically tailored for additive manufacturing (AM). By employing a graph neural network (GNN) that acts as a neural field over the finite element mesh, the framework effectively learns and predicts continuous material distributions. An integrated AM filter ensures printability by eliminating unsupported overhangs, while the optimization process minimizes structural compliance under volume and stress constraints. The stress constraint is enforced using a differentiable p-norm aggregation of von Mises stress, promoting mechanical reliability in the optimized designs. A key advantage of the approach lies in its fully differentiable architecture, which leverages automatic differentiation throughout the optimization loop--eliminating the need for explicit sensitivity derivation for both the filter and the stress constraint. Numerical experiments demonstrate the ability of the framework to generate stress-constrained manufacturable topologies under various loading and boundary conditions, offering a practical pathway toward AM-ready high-performance designs with reduced post-processing requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Multi-facet Paths for Heterogeneous Graph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20648v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) and heterogeneous GNNs (HGNNs) have advanced node embeddings and relationship learning for various tasks. However, existing methods often rely on domain-specific predefined meta-paths, which are coarse-grained and focus solely on aspects like node type, limiting their ability to capture complex interactions. We introduce MF2Vec, a model that uses multi-faceted (fine-grained) paths instead of predefined meta-paths. MF2Vec extracts paths via random walks and generates multi-faceted vectors, ignoring predefined schemas. This method learns diverse aspects of nodes and their relationships, constructs a homogeneous network, and creates node embeddings for classification, link prediction, and clustering. Extensive experiments show that MF2Vec outperforms existing methods, offering a more flexible and comprehensive framework for analyzing complex networks. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MF2Vec-6ABC.</p></details> |  |
| **[MCI-GRU: Stock Prediction Model Based on Multi-Head Cross-Attention and Improved GRU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20679v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As financial markets grow increasingly complex in the big data era, accurate stock prediction has become more critical. Traditional time series models, such as GRUs, have been widely used but often struggle to capture the intricate nonlinear dynamics of markets, particularly in the flexible selection and effective utilization of key historical information. Recently, methods like Graph Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning have shown promise in stock prediction but require high data quality and quantity, and they tend to exhibit instability when dealing with data sparsity and noise. Moreover, the training and inference processes for these models are typically complex and computationally expensive, limiting their broad deployment in practical applications. Existing approaches also generally struggle to capture unobservable latent market states effectively, such as market sentiment and expectations, microstructural factors, and participant behavior patterns, leading to an inadequate understanding of market dynamics and subsequently impact prediction accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a stock prediction model, MCI-GRU, based on a multi-head cross-attention mechanism and an improved GRU. First, we enhance the GRU model by replacing the reset gate with an attention mechanism, thereby increasing the model's flexibility in selecting and utilizing historical information. Second, we design a multi-head cross-attention mechanism for learning unobservable latent market state representations, which are further enriched through interactions with both temporal features and cross-sectional features. Finally, extensive experiments on four main stock markets show that the proposed method outperforms SOTA techniques across multiple metrics. Additionally, its successful application in real-world fund management operations confirms its effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Triangulation-Based Graph Rewiring for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19071v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the leading paradigm for learning over graph-structured data. However, their performance is limited by issues inherent to graph topology, most notably oversquashing and oversmoothing. Recent advances in graph rewiring aim to mitigate these limitations by modifying the graph topology to promote more effective information propagation. In this work, we introduce TRIGON, a novel framework that constructs enriched, non-planar triangulations by learning to select relevant triangles from multiple graph views. By jointly optimizing triangle selection and downstream classification performance, our method produces a rewired graph with markedly improved structural properties such as reduced diameter, increased spectral gap, and lower effective resistance compared to existing rewiring methods. Empirical results demonstrate that TRIGON outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on node classification tasks across a range of homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CIKM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Automated discovery of finite volume schemes using Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19052v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have deeply modified the landscape of numerical simulations by demonstrating strong capabilities in approximating solutions of physical systems. However, their ability to extrapolate beyond their training domain (\textit{e.g.} larger or structurally different graphs) remains uncertain. In this work, we establish that GNNs can serve purposes beyond their traditional role, and be exploited to generate numerical schemes, in conjunction with symbolic regression. First, we show numerically and theoretically that a GNN trained on a dataset consisting solely of two-node graphs can extrapolate a first-order Finite Volume (FV) scheme for the heat equation on out-of-distribution, unstructured meshes. Specifically, if a GNN achieves a loss $\varepsilon$ on such a dataset, it implements the FV scheme with an error of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$. Using symbolic regression, we show that the network effectively rediscovers the exact analytical formulation of the standard first-order FV scheme. We then extend this approach to an unsupervised context: the GNN recovers the first-order FV scheme using only a residual loss similar to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with no access to ground-truth data. Finally, we push the methodology further by considering higher-order schemes: we train (i) a 2-hop and (ii) a 2-layers GNN using the same PINN loss, that autonomously discover (i) a second-order correction term to the initial scheme using a 2-hop stencil, and (ii) the classic second-order midpoint scheme. These findings follows a recent paradigm in scientific computing: GNNs are not only strong approximators, but can be active contributors to the development of novel numerical methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[VISION: Robust and Interpretable Code Vulnerability Detection Leveraging Counterfactual Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18933v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential cybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner. However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset. Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to 97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20 vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalization, Expressivity, and Universality of Graph Neural Networks on Attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05464v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyze the universality and generalization of graph neural networks (GNNs) on attributed graphs, i.e., with node attributes. To this end, we propose pseudometrics over the space of all attributed graphs that describe the fine-grained expressivity of GNNs. Namely, GNNs are both Lipschitz continuous with respect to our pseudometrics and can separate attributed graphs that are distant in the metric. Moreover, we prove that the space of all attributed graphs is relatively compact with respect to our metrics. Based on these properties, we prove a universal approximation theorem for GNNs and generalization bounds for GNNs on any data distribution of attributed graphs. The proposed metrics compute the similarity between the structures of attributed graphs via a hierarchical optimal transport between computation trees. Our work extends and unites previous approaches which either derived theory only for graphs with no attributes, derived compact metrics under which GNNs are continuous but without separation power, or derived metrics under which GNNs are continuous and separate points but the space of graphs is not relatively compact, which prevents universal approximation and generalization analysis.</p></details> |  |

HGNN-DDI leverages graph representation learning to model heterogeneous biomedical networks, enabling effective information propagation across diverse node and edge types. Experimental results on benchmark DDI datasets demonstrate that HGNN-DDI outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in prediction accuracy and robustness, highlighting its potential to support safer drug development and precision medicine.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures.

However, GNNs lack the inherent semantic understanding capability of rich textual node attributes, limiting their effectiveness in applications. On the other hand, we empirically observe that for existing GNN models, no one can consistently outperforms others across diverse datasets. In this paper, we study whether LLMs can act as an ensembler for multi-GNNs and propose the LensGNN model. The model first aligns multiple GNNs, mapping the representations of different GNNs into the same space. Then, through LoRA fine-tuning, it aligns the space between the GNN and the LLM, injecting graph tokens and textual information into LLMs. This allows LensGNN to ensemble multiple GNNs and take advantage of the strengths of LLM, leading to a deeper understanding of both textual semantic information and graph structural information. The experimental results show that LensGNN outperforms existing models. This research advances text-attributed graph ensemble learning by providing a robust and superior solution for integrating semantic and structural information.

Based on extensions of standard results in graphon analysis to graphon-signals, the paper proved a generalization bound and a sampling lemma for MPNNs. However, there are some missing ingredients in that paper, limiting its applicability in practical settings of graph machine learning. In the current paper, we introduce several refinements and extensions to existing results that address these shortcomings. In detail, 1) we extend the main results in the paper to graphon-signals with multidimensional signals (rather than 1D signals), 2) we extend the Lipschitz continuity to MPNNs with readout with respect to cut distance (rather than MPNNs without readout with respect to cut metric), 3) we improve the generalization bound by utilizing robustness-type generalization bounds, and 4) we extend the analysis to non-symmetric graphons and kernels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Network Based Action Ranking for Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04752v3)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel approach to learn relational policies for classical planning based on learning to rank actions. We introduce a new graph representation that explicitly captures action information and propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture augmented with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to learn action rankings. Unlike value-function based approaches that must learn a globally consistent function, our action ranking method only needs to learn locally consistent ranking, which is more sample-efficient. Our model is trained on data generated from small problem instances that are easily solved by planners and is applied to significantly larger instances where planning is computationally prohibitive. Experimental results across standard planning benchmarks demonstrate that our action-ranking approach not only achieves better generalization to larger problems than those used in training but also outperforms multiple baseline (value function and action ranking) methods in terms of success rate and plan quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 Pag...</summary><p>6 Pages, 1 figure.

However, existing 3D world models are primarily limited to single-material dynamics using a particle-based Graph Neural Network model, and often require time-consuming 3D scene reconstruction to obtain 3D particle tracks for training. In this work, we present ParticleFormer, a Transformer-based point cloud world model trained with a hybrid point cloud reconstruction loss, supervising both global and local dynamics features in multi-material, multi-object robot interactions. ParticleFormer captures fine-grained multi-object interactions between rigid, deformable, and flexible materials, trained directly from real-world robot perception data without an elaborate scene reconstruction. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness both in 3D scene forecasting tasks, and in downstream manipulation tasks using a Model Predictive Control (MPC) policy. In addition, we extend existing dynamics learning benchmarks to include diverse multi-material, multi-object interaction scenarios. We validate our method on six simulation and three real-world experiments, where it consistently outperforms leading baselines by achieving superior dynamics prediction accuracy and less rollout error in downstream visuomotor tasks.

Preserving this equivalence, GNNs can universally approximate any target function on graphs in probability up to any precision. However, these results are limited to attributed discrete-dynamic graphs represented as sequences of connected graph snapshots. Real-world systems, such as communication networks, financial transaction networks, and molecular interactions, evolve asynchronously and may split into disconnected components. In this paper, we extend the theory of attributed discrete-dynamic graphs to attributed continuous-time dynamic graphs with arbitrary connectivity. To this end, we introduce a continuous-time dynamic 1-WL test, prove its equivalence to continuous-time dynamic unfolding trees, and identify a class of continuous-time dynamic GNNs (CGNNs) based on discrete-dynamic GNN architectures that retain both distinguishing power and universal approximation guarantees. Our constructive proofs further yield practical design guidelines, emphasizing a compact and expressive CGNN architecture with piece-wise continuously differentiable temporal functions to process asynchronous, disconnected graphs.</p></details> |  |

These architectures have inspired numerous enhancements, including multigrid approaches and $K$-hop aggregation (using neighbours of distance $K$), yet they often introduce significant complexity and suffer from limited in-depth investigations. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel Graph Transformer architecture that leverages the adjacency matrix as an attention mask. The proposed approach incorporates innovative augmentations, including Dilated Sliding Windows and Global Attention, to extend receptive fields without sacrificing computational efficiency. Through extensive experimentation, we evaluate model size, adjacency matrix augmentations, positional encoding and $K$-hop configurations using challenging 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) datasets. We also train over 60 models to find a scaling law between training FLOPs and parameters. The introduced models demonstrate remarkable scalability, performing on meshes with up to 300k nodes and 3 million edges. Notably, the smallest model achieves parity with MeshGraphNet while being $7\times$ faster and $6\times$ smaller. The largest model surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by $38.8$\% on average and outperforms MeshGraphNet by $52$\% on the all-rollout RMSE, while having a similar training speed.

However, their performance in multi-agent path finding (MAPF) tasks has been less than satisfactory, with only a few studies exploring this area. MAPF is a complex problem requiring both planning and multi-agent coordination. To improve the performance of LLM in MAPF tasks, we propose a novel framework, LLM-NAR, which leverages neural algorithmic reasoners (NAR) to inform LLM for MAPF. LLM-NAR consists of three key components: an LLM for MAPF, a pre-trained graph neural network-based NAR, and a cross-attention mechanism. This is the first work to propose using a neural algorithmic reasoner to integrate GNNs with the map information for MAPF, thereby guiding LLM to achieve superior performance. LLM-NAR can be easily adapted to various LLM models. Both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing LLM-based approaches in solving MAPF problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

However, existing spiking GNNs predominantly operate in Euclidean space and rely on fixed geometric assumptions, limiting their capacity to model complex graph structures such as hierarchies and cycles. To overcome these limitations, we propose \method{}, a novel Geometry-Aware Spiking Graph Neural Network that unifies spike-based neural dynamics with adaptive representation learning on Riemannian manifolds. \method{} features three key components: a Riemannian Embedding Layer that projects node features into a pool of constant-curvature manifolds, capturing non-Euclidean structures; a Manifold Spiking Layer that models membrane potential evolution and spiking behavior in curved spaces via geometry-consistent neighbor aggregation and curvature-based attention; and a Manifold Learning Objective that enables instance-wise geometry adaptation through jointly optimized classification and link prediction losses defined over geodesic distances. All modules are trained using Riemannian SGD, eliminating the need for backpropagation through time. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that GSG achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and energy efficiency compared to both Euclidean SNNs and manifold-based GNNs, establishing a new paradigm for curvature-aware, energy-efficient graph learning.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose S$^2$G-Net, a novel neural architecture that unifies state-space sequence modeling with multi-view Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for ICU LOS prediction. The temporal path employs Mamba state-space models (SSMs) to capture patient trajectories, while the graph path leverages an optimized GraphGPS backbone, designed to integrate heterogeneous patient similarity graphs derived from diagnostic, administrative, and semantic features. Experiments on the large-scale MIMIC-IV cohort dataset show that S$^2$G-Net consistently outperforms sequence models (BiLSTM, Mamba, Transformer), graph models (classic GNNs, GraphGPS), and hybrid approaches across all primary metrics. Extensive ablation studies and interpretability analyses highlight the complementary contributions of each component of our architecture and underscore the importance of principled graph construction. These results demonstrate that S$^2$G-Net provides an effective and scalable solution for ICU LOS prediction with multi-modal clinical data.</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are limited by fixed label spaces, while Large Language Models (LLMs) lack structural inductive biases. Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) provide a zero-shot alternative via explicit, long chain-of-thought reasoning. Inspired by this, we propose a GNN-free approach that reformulates graph tasks--node classification, link prediction, and graph classification--as textual reasoning problems solved by LRMs. We introduce the first datasets with detailed reasoning traces for these tasks and develop Graph-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that leverages task-specific rethink templates to guide reasoning over linearized graphs. Experiments demonstrate that Graph-R1 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in zero-shot settings, producing interpretable and effective predictions. Our work highlights the promise of explicit reasoning for graph learning and provides new resources for future research.</p></details> |  |

In addition, we incorporate molecular fingerprints as a complementary modality and introduce a mechanism of interaction between attention to adaptively fuse information across representations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that MLFGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both classification and regression tasks.

Traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often require re-training for different graph tasks and datasets. Although the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced new paradigms in natural language processing, their potential for generic graph mining, training a single model to simultaneously handle diverse tasks and datasets, remains under-explored. To this end, our novel framework MuseGraph, seamlessly integrates the strengths of GNNs and LLMs into one foundation model for graph mining across tasks and datasets. This framework first features a compact graph description to encapsulate key graph information within language token limitations. Then, we propose a diverse instruction generation mechanism with Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based instruction packages to distill the reasoning capabilities from advanced LLMs like GPT-4. Finally, we design a graph-aware instruction tuning strategy to facilitate mutual enhancement across multiple tasks and datasets while preventing catastrophic forgetting of LLMs' generative abilities. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in five graph tasks and ten datasets, showcasing the potential of our MuseGraph in enhancing the accuracy of graph-oriented downstream tasks while improving the generation abilities of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI 2025</p></details> |

To address these limitations, we introduce Hamiltonian-Masked Autoencoding (HMAE), a novel self-supervised framework that pre-trains transformers on unlabeled quantum Hamiltonians, enabling efficient few-shot transfer learning. Unlike random masking approaches, HMAE employs a physics-informed strategy based on quantum information theory to selectively mask Hamiltonian terms based on their physical significance. Experiments on 12,500 quantum Hamiltonians (60% real-world, 40% synthetic) demonstrate that HMAE achieves 85.3% $\pm$ 1.5% accuracy in phase classification and 0.15 $\pm$ 0.02 eV MAE in ground state energy prediction with merely 10 labeled examples - a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.01) over classical graph neural networks (78.1% $\pm$ 2.1%) and quantum neural networks (76.8% $\pm$ 2.3%). Our method's primary advantage is exceptional sample efficiency - reducing required labeled examples by 3-5x compared to baseline methods - though we emphasize that ground truth values for fine-tuning and evaluation still require exact diagonalization or tensor networks. We explicitly acknowledge that our current approach is limited to small quantum systems (specifically limited to 12 qubits during training, with limited extension to 16-20 qubits in testing) and that, while promising within this regime, this size restriction prevents immediate application to larger systems of practical interest in materials science and quantum chemistry.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equivariant Spherical Transformer for Efficient Molecular Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23086v2)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SE(3)-equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced molecular system modeling by employing group representations. However, their message passing processes, which rely on tensor product-based convolutions, are limited by insufficient non-linearity and incomplete group representations, thereby restricting expressiveness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Equivariant Spherical Transformer (EST), a novel framework that leverages a Transformer structure within the spatial domain of group representations after Fourier transform. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that EST can encompass the function space of tensor products while achieving superior expressiveness. Furthermore, EST's equivariant inductive bias is guaranteed through a uniform sampling strategy for the Fourier transform. Our experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance by EST on various molecular benchmarks, including OC20 and QM9.</p></details> | 24 pages, 3 figures |

Traditional graph neural networks often struggle to capture long-range dependencies between nodes due to their local structure. Graph transformers overcome this by using attention mechanisms that allow nodes to exchange information globally. However, there are two types of attention in graph transformers: dense and sparse. In this paper, we compare these two attention mechanisms, analyze their trade-offs, and highlight when to use each. We also outline current challenges and problems in designing attention for graph transformers.</p></details> |  |

However, their predictions are mis-calibrated and lack interpretability, limiting their adoption in critical applications. To address this issue, we propose a new uncertainty-aware and interpretable graph classification model that combines graph functional neural process and graph generative model. The core of our method is to assume a set of latent rationales which can be mapped to a probabilistic embedding space; the predictive distribution of the classifier is conditioned on such rationale embeddings by learning a stochastic correlation matrix. The graph generator serves to decode the graph structure of the rationales from the embedding space for model interpretability. For efficient model training, we adopt an alternating optimization procedure which mimics the well known Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed method is general and can be applied to any existing GNN architecture. Extensive experiments on five graph classification datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both uncertainty quantification and GNN interpretability. We also conduct case studies to show that the decoded rationale structure can provide meaningful explanations.</p></details> | AISTATS'25 |

To address these limitations, we introduce a score-based generative model with an equivariant graph neural network that simulates gravitational clustering of galaxies across cosmologies starting from an informed prior, respects periodic boundaries, and scales to full galaxy counts in simulations. A novel topology-aware noise schedule, crucial for large geometric graphs, is introduced. The proposed equivariant score-based model successfully generates full-scale cosmological point clouds of up to 600,000 halos, respects periodicity and a uniform prior, and outperforms existing diffusion models in capturing clustering statistics while offering significant computational advantages. This work advances cosmology by introducing a generative model designed to closely resemble the underlying gravitational clustering of structure formation, moving closer to physically realistic and efficient simulators for the evolution of large-scale structures in the universe.</p></details> |  |

By analyzing the sensitivity of QUBO formulations, we frame the solution of QUBO problems as a heterophilic node classification task. We then propose QUBO-GNN, an architecture that integrates graph representation learning techniques with QUBO-aware features to approximate solutions efficiently. Additionally, we introduce a self-supervised data generation mechanism to enable efficient and scalable training data acquisition even for large-scale QUBO instances. Experimental evaluations of QUBO-GNN across diverse QUBO problem sizes demonstrate its superior performance compared to exhaustive search and heuristic methods. Finally, we discuss open challenges in the emerging intersection between QUBO optimization and GNN-based learning.</p></details> | ECAI 2025 |

However, as a typical complex network, data-driven deep learning is still in its infancy in describing and analyzing the resilience of complex networks, and its core is the lack of a theoretical framework to describe the system dynamics. In this paper, we propose a physically informative neural symbolic approach to describe the evolutionary dynamics of complex networks for resilient prediction. The core idea is to learn the dynamics of the activity state of physical entities and integrate it into the multi-layer spatiotemporal co-evolution network, and use the physical information method to realize the joint learning of physical symbol dynamics and spatiotemporal co-evolution topology, so as to predict the industrial chain resilience. The experimental results show that the model can obtain better results and predict the elasticity of the industry chain more accurately and effectively, which has certain practical significance for the development of the industry.</p></details> |  |

The observation and formulation of these limitations have become foundational in constructing more informative graph representations. In this paper, we delve into the limitations of MPNNs, focusing on aspects that have previously been overlooked. Our observations reveal that even within a single layer, the information specific to an individual node can become significantly diluted. To delve into this phenomenon in depth, we present the concept of Over-dilution and formulate it with two dilution factors: intra-node dilution for attribute-level and inter-node dilution for node-level representations. We also introduce a transformer-based solution that alleviates over-dilution and complements existing node embedding methods like MPNNs. Our findings provide new insights and contribute to the development of informative representations.

Hyperbolic geometry, with its constant negative curvature and exponential growth property, naturally accommodates such structures, offering a promising alternative for learning rich graph representations. This survey paper provides a comprehensive review of the rapidly evolving field of Hyperbolic Graph Learning (HGL). We systematically categorize and analyze existing methods broadly dividing them into (1) hyperbolic graph embedding-based techniques, (2) graph neural network-based hyperbolic models, and (3) emerging paradigms. Beyond methodologies, we extensively discuss diverse applications of HGL across multiple domains, including recommender systems, knowledge graphs, bioinformatics, and other relevant scenarios, demonstrating the broad applicability and effectiveness of hyperbolic geometry in real-world graph learning tasks. Most importantly, we identify several key challenges that serve as directions for advancing HGL, including handling complex data structures, developing geometry-aware learning objectives, ensuring trustworthy and scalable implementations, and integrating with foundation models, e.g., large language models.

Traditional models often rely on parametric kernels, limiting their ability to capture heterogeneous, nonstationary dynamics. Recent innovations integrate deep neural architectures -- either by modeling the conditional intensity function directly or by learning flexible, data-driven influence kernels, substantially broadening their expressive power. This article reviews the development of the deep influence kernel approach, which enjoys statistical explainability, since the influence kernel remains in the model to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of event influence and its impact on future events, while also possessing strong expressive power, thereby benefiting from both worlds. We explain the main components in developing deep kernel point processes, leveraging tools such as functional basis decomposition and graph neural networks to encode complex spatial or network structures, as well as estimation using both likelihood-based and likelihood-free methods, and address computational scalability for large-scale data. We also discuss the theoretical foundation of kernel identifiability. Simulated and real-data examples highlight applications to crime analysis, earthquake aftershock prediction, and sepsis prediction modeling, and we conclude by discussing promising directions for the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Annua...</summary><p>Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application, 2025</p></details> |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach to assist EDA design as circuits can be naturally represented as graphs. While GNNs offer a foundation for circuit analysis, they often fail to capture the full complexity of EDA designs. Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) can better interpret EDA circuit graphs as they capture both topological relationships and geometric features. However, the improved representation capability comes at the cost of even higher computational complexity and processing cost due to their serial module-wise message-passing scheme, creating a significant performance bottleneck. In this paper, we propose DR-CircuitGNN, a fast GPU kernel design by leveraging row-wise sparsity-aware Dynamic-ReLU and optimizing SpMM kernels during heterogeneous message-passing to accelerate HGNNs training on EDA-related circuit graph datasets. To further enhance performance, we propose a parallel optimization strategy that maximizes CPU-GPU concurrency by concurrently processing independent subgraphs using multi-threaded CPU initialization and GPU kernel execution via multiple cudaStreams. Our experiments show that on three representative CircuitNet designs (small, medium, large), the proposed method can achieve up to 3.51x and 4.09x speedup compared to the SOTA for forward and backward propagation, respectively. On full-size CircuitNet and sampled Mini-CircuitNet, our parallel design enables up to 2.71x speed up over the official DGL implementation cuSPARSE with negligible impact on correlation scores and error rates.</p></details> |  |

Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can both leverage graph-structured data, but their inherent functioning is different. The question is how do they compare in capturing the information contained in networked datasets? We address this objective by solving a link prediction task and we conduct three main experiments, on both synthetic and real networks: one focuses on how PGMs and GNNs handle input features, while the other two investigate their robustness to noisy features and increasing heterophily of the graph. PGMs do not necessarily require features on nodes, while GNNs cannot exploit the network edges alone, and the choice of input features matters. We find that GNNs are outperformed by PGMs when input features are low-dimensional or noisy, mimicking many real scenarios where node attributes might be scalar or noisy. Then, we find that PGMs are more robust than GNNs when the heterophily of the graph is increased. Finally, to assess performance beyond prediction tasks, we also compare the two frameworks in terms of their computational complexity and interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Node-Aware Dynamic Quantization Approach for Graph Collaborative Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16516v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of collaborative filtering recommendation systems, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance but face significant challenges in deployment on resource-constrained edge devices due to their high embedding parameter requirements and computational costs. Using common quantization method directly on node embeddings may overlooks their graph based structure, causing error accumulation during message passing and degrading the quality of quantized embeddings.To address this, we propose Graph based Node-Aware Dynamic Quantization training for collaborative filtering (GNAQ), a novel quantization approach that leverages graph structural information to enhance the balance between efficiency and accuracy of GNNs for Top-K recommendation. GNAQ introduces a node-aware dynamic quantization strategy that adapts quantization scales to individual node embeddings by incorporating graph interaction relationships. Specifically, it initializes quantization intervals based on node-wise feature distributions and dynamically refines them through message passing in GNN layers. This approach mitigates information loss caused by fixed quantization scales and captures hierarchical semantic features in user-item interaction graphs. Additionally, GNAQ employs graph relation-aware gradient estimation to replace traditional straight-through estimators, ensuring more accurate gradient propagation during training. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that GNAQ outperforms state-of-the-art quantization methods, including BiGeaR and N2UQ, by achieving average improvement in 27.8\% Recall@10 and 17.6\% NDCG@10 under 2-bit quantization. In particular, GNAQ is capable of maintaining the performance of full-precision models while reducing their model sizes by 8 to 12 times; in addition, the training time is twice as fast compared to quantization baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often fail to fully capture the complementary features embedded within structural and functional connectomes, constraining both biological insight and predictive performance. To address this, we introduced NeuroKoop, a novel graph neural network-based framework that integrates structural and functional brain networks utilizing neural Koopman operator-driven latent space fusion. By leveraging Koopman theory, NeuroKoop unifies node embeddings derived from source-based morphometry (SBM) and functional network connectivity (FNC) based brain graphs, resulting in enhanced representation learning and more robust classification of prenatal drug exposure (PDE) status. Applied to a large adolescent cohort from the ABCD dataset, NeuroKoop outperformed relevant baselines and revealed salient structural-functional connections, advancing our understanding of the neurodevelopmental impact of PDE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version of the paper accepted to IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI'25), 2025.

Existing machine learning (ML) surrogates often require large datasets to generalize across various topologies or to accurately model skewed and multi-modal performance metrics. In this work, a lightweight, data-efficient, and topology-aware graph neural network (GNN) model is proposed for predicting key performance metrics of multiple topologies of active RF circuits such as low noise amplifiers (LNAs), mixers, voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), and PAs. To capture transistor-level symmetry and preserve fine-grained connectivity details, circuits are modeled at the device-terminal level, enabling scalable message passing while reducing data requirements. Masked autoregressive flow (MAF) output heads are incorporated to improve robustness in modeling complex target distributions. Experiments on datasets demonstrate high prediction accuracy, with symmetric mean absolute percentage error (sMAPE) and mean relative error (MRE) averaging 2.40% and 2.91%, respectively. Owing to the pin-level conversion of circuit to graph and ML architecture robust to modeling complex densities of RF metrics, the MRE is improved by 3.14x while using 2.24x fewer training samples compared to prior work, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for rapid and accurate RF circuit design automation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

FGL does that by leveraging the passive movement of energy-constrained nanodevices circulating through the bloodstream. Existing FGL solutions rely on graph models with fixed topologies or handcrafted features, which limit their adaptability to anatomical variability and hinder scalability. In this work, we explore the use of Set Transformer architectures to address these limitations. Our formulation treats nanodevices' circulation time reports as unordered sets, enabling permutation-invariant, variable-length input processing without relying on spatial priors. To improve robustness under data scarcity and class imbalance, we integrate synthetic data generation via deep generative models, including CGAN, WGAN, WGAN-GP, and CVAE. These models are trained to replicate realistic circulation time distributions conditioned on vascular region labels, and are used to augment the training data. Our results show that the Set Transformer achieves comparable classification accuracy compared to Graph Neural Networks (GNN) baselines, while simultaneously providing by-design improved generalization to anatomical variability. The findings highlight the potential of permutation-invariant models and synthetic augmentation for robust and scalable nanoscale localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables, 26 references, accepted at ACM NanoCom'25</p></details> |

To handle the challenges arising from dynamic low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite topologies and heterogeneous content demands, we propose a learning-based framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The satellite network is represented as a dynamic graph, where GNNs are embedded within the DRL agent to capture spatial and topological dependencies and support routing-aware decision-making. The caching strategy is optimized by formulating the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and applying soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the delivery success rate and reduces communication traffic cost.</p></details> | 5 pages, 6 figures |

However, similar to graph neural networks (GNNs), GCL models are susceptible to graph structural attacks. As an unsupervised method, GCL faces greater challenges in defending against adversarial attacks. Furthermore, there has been limited research on enhancing the robustness of GCL. To thoroughly explore the failure of GCL on the poisoned graphs, we investigate the detrimental effects of graph structural attacks against the GCL framework. We discover that, in addition to the conventional observation that graph structural attacks tend to connect dissimilar node pairs, these attacks also diminish the mutual information between the graph and its representations from an information-theoretical perspective, which is the cornerstone of the high-quality node embeddings for GCL. Motivated by this theoretical insight, we propose a robust graph contrastive learning framework with a learnable sanitation view that endeavors to sanitize the augmented graphs by restoring the diminished mutual information caused by the structural attacks. Additionally, we design a fully unsupervised tuning strategy to tune the hyperparameters without accessing the label information, which strictly coincides with the defender's knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method compared to competitive baselines.</p></details> |  |

While first principles calculations are accurate in predicting these properties, their computational expense combined with the vast search space of surfaces make a comprehensive screening approach with density functional theory (DFT) infeasible. Here, we introduce FIRE-GNN (Force-Informed, Relaxed Equivariance Graph Neural Network), which integrates surface-normal symmetry breaking and machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP)-derived force information, achieving a twofold reduction in mean absolute error (down to 0.065 eV) over the previous state-of-the-art for work function prediction. We additionally benchmark recent invariant and equivariant architectures, analyze the impact of symmetry breaking, and evaluate out-of-distribution generalization, demonstrating that FIRE-GNN consistently outperforms competing models for work function predictions. This model enables accurate and rapid predictions of the work function and cleavage energy across a vast chemical space and facilitates the discovery of materials with tuned surface properties</p></details> |  |

However, various PIM devices such as ReRAM, FeFET, PCM, MRAM, and SRAM exist, with each device offering unique trade-offs in terms of power, latency, area, and non-idealities. A heterogeneous manycore architecture enabled by 3D integration can combine multiple PIM devices on a single platform, to enable energy-efficient and high-performance GNN training. In this work, we propose a 3D heterogeneous PIM-based accelerator for GNN training referred to as HePGA. We leverage the unique characteristics of GNN layers and associated computing kernels to optimize their mapping on to different PIM devices as well as planar tiers. Our experimental analysis shows that HePGA outperforms existing PIM-based architectures by up to 3.8x and 6.8x in energy-efficiency (TOPS/W) and compute efficiency (TOPS/mm2) respectively, without sacrificing the GNN prediction accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of HePGA to accelerate inferencing of emerging transformer models.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes the Tree-like Pairwise Interaction Network (PIN), a novel neural network architecture that explicitly captures pairwise feature interactions through a shared feed-forward neural network architecture that mimics the structure of decision trees. PIN enables intrinsic interpretability by design, allowing for direct inspection of interaction effects. Moreover, it allows for efficient SHapley's Additive exPlanation (SHAP) computations because it only involves pairwise interactions. We highlight connections between PIN and established models such as GA2Ms, gradient boosting machines, and graph neural networks. Empirical results on the popular French motor insurance dataset show that PIN outperforms both traditional and modern neural networks benchmarks in predictive accuracy, while also providing insight into how features interact with each another and how they contribute to the predictions.</p></details> |  |

With the growing adoption of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), CFG-based representations have proven highly effective for malware detection. This study proposes a novel framework that dynamically constructs CFGs and embeds node features using a hybrid approach combining rule-based encoding and autoencoder-based embedding. A GNN-based classifier is then constructed to detect malicious behavior from the resulting graph representations. To improve model interpretability, we apply state-of-the-art explainability techniques, including GNNExplainer, PGExplainer, and CaptumExplainer, the latter is utilized three attribution methods: Integrated Gradients, Guided Backpropagation, and Saliency. In addition, we introduce a novel aggregation method, called RankFusion, that integrates the outputs of the top-performing explainers to enhance the explanation quality. We also evaluate explanations using two subgraph extraction strategies, including the proposed Greedy Edge-wise Composition (GEC) method for improved structural coherence. A comprehensive evaluation using accuracy, fidelity, and consistency metrics demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of accurate identification of malware samples and generating reliable and interpretable explanations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Let's Grow an Unbiased Community: Guiding the Fairness of Graphs via New Links](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15499v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications. However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, their computational complexity and irregular memory access patterns pose significant challenges for deployment on FPGAs in hardware trigger systems, where strict latency and resource constraints apply. In this work, we propose JEDI-linear, a novel GNN architecture with linear computational complexity that eliminates explicit pairwise interactions by leveraging shared transformations and global aggregation. To further enhance hardware efficiency, we introduce fine-grained quantization-aware training with per-parameter bitwidth optimization and employ multiplier-free multiply-accumulate operations via distributed arithmetic. Evaluation results show that our FPGA-based JEDI-linear achieves 3.7 to 11.5 times lower latency, up to 150 times lower initiation interval, and up to 6.2 times lower LUT usage compared to state-of-the-art designs while also delivering higher model accuracy and eliminating the need for DSP blocks entirely. In contrast, state-of-the-art solutions consume over 8,700 DSPs. This is the first interaction-based GNN to achieve less than 60~ns latency and currently meets the requirements for use in the HL-LHC CMS Level-1 trigger system. This work advances the next-generation trigger systems by enabling accurate, scalable, and resource-efficient GNN inference in real-time environments. Our open-sourced templates will further support reproducibility and broader adoption across scientific applications.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |

Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and tested on different datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, their black-box nature reduces interpretability, which limits trust in their predictions for important applications such as drug discovery and materials design. Furthermore, existing explanation techniques often fail to reliably quantify the contribution of individual atoms or substructures due to the entangled message-passing dynamics. We introduce SEAL (Substructure Explanation via Attribution Learning), a new interpretable graph neural network that attributes model predictions to meaningful molecular subgraphs. SEAL decomposes input graphs into chemically relevant fragments and estimates their causal influence on the output. The strong alignment between fragment contributions and model predictions is achieved by explicitly reducing inter-fragment message passing in our proposed model architecture. Extensive evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world molecular datasets demonstrate that SEAL outperforms other explainability methods in both quantitative attribution metrics and human-aligned interpretability. A user study further confirms that SEAL provides more intuitive and trustworthy explanations to domain experts. By bridging the gap between predictive performance and interpretability, SEAL offers a promising direction for more transparent and actionable molecular modeling.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces a novel approach that integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams to enhance image classification by leveraging their ability to effectively model relational data. Unlike conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification. This research not only presents a novel perspective on image classification but also expands the potential applications of graph-based learning paradigms in computer vision and unstructured data analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, proceeding into CanadianAI 2025</p></details> |

However, similar to other machine learning models, GNNs can exhibit bias in predictions based on attributes like race and gender. Moreover, bias in GNNs can be exacerbated by the graph structure and message-passing mechanisms. Recent cutting-edge methods propose mitigating bias by filtering out sensitive information from input or representations, like edge dropping or feature masking. Yet, we argue that such strategies may unintentionally eliminate non-sensitive features, leading to a compromised balance between predictive accuracy and fairness. To tackle this challenge, we present a novel approach utilizing counterfactual data augmentation for bias mitigation. This method involves creating diverse neighborhoods using counterfactuals before message passing, facilitating unbiased node representations learning from the augmented graph. Subsequently, an adversarial discriminator is employed to diminish bias in predictions by conventional GNN classifiers. Our proposed technique, Fair-ICD, ensures the fairness of GNNs under moderate conditions. Experiments on standard datasets using three GNN backbones demonstrate that Fair-ICD notably enhances fairness metrics while preserving high predictive performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 2024 KDD Workshop</p></details> |

The key challenge in graph density estimation lies in effectively capturing both structural patterns and semantic variations while maintaining theoretical guarantees. Combining graph kernels and kernel density estimation (KDE) is a standard approach to graph density estimation, but has unsatisfactory performance due to the handcrafted and fixed features of kernels. Our method LGKDE leverages graph neural networks to represent each graph as a discrete distribution and utilizes maximum mean discrepancy to learn the graph metric for multi-scale KDE, where all parameters are learned by maximizing the density of graphs relative to the density of their well-designed perturbed counterparts. The perturbations are conducted on both node features and graph spectra, which helps better characterize the boundary of normal density regions. Theoretically, we establish consistency and convergence guarantees for LGKDE, including bounds on the mean integrated squared error, robustness, and complexity. We validate LGKDE by demonstrating its effectiveness in recovering the underlying density of synthetic graph distributions and applying it to graph anomaly detection across diverse benchmark datasets. Extensive empirical evaluation shows that LGKDE demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines on most benchmark datasets.</p></details> | Under Review |

These models feature uniqueness in efficient computation as well as rich expressiveness, which stems from advanced management and profound understanding of graph data. However, few systematic studies have been conducted to assess spectral GNNs, particularly in benchmarking their efficiency, memory consumption, and effectiveness in a unified and fair manner. There is also a pressing need to select spectral models suitable for learning specific graph data and deploying them to massive web-scale graphs, which is currently constrained by the varied model designs and training settings. In this work, we extensively benchmark spectral GNNs with a focus on the spectral perspective, demystifying them as spectral graph filters. We analyze and categorize 35 GNNs with 27 corresponding filters, spanning diverse formulations and utilizations of the graph data. Then, we implement the filters within a unified spectral-oriented framework with dedicated graph computations and efficient training schemes. In particular, our implementation enables the deployment of spectral GNNs over million-scale graphs and various tasks with comparable performance and less overhead. Thorough experiments are conducted on the graph filters with comprehensive metrics on effectiveness and efficiency, offering novel observations and practical guidelines that are only available from our evaluations across graph scales. Different from the prevailing belief, our benchmark reveals an intricate landscape regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of spectral graph filters, demonstrating the potential to achieve desirable performance through tailored spectral manipulation of graph data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report with Appendix.

| **[Structure-Aware Temporal Modeling for Chronic Disease Progression Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14942v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study addresses the challenges of symptom evolution complexity and insufficient temporal dependency modeling in Parkinson's disease progression prediction. It proposes a unified prediction framework that integrates structural perception and temporal modeling. The method leverages graph neural networks to model the structural relationships among multimodal clinical symptoms and introduces graph-based representations to capture semantic dependencies between symptoms. It also incorporates a Transformer architecture to model dynamic temporal features during disease progression. To fuse structural and temporal information, a structure-aware gating mechanism is designed to dynamically adjust the fusion weights between structural encodings and temporal features, enhancing the model's ability to identify key progression stages. To improve classification accuracy and stability, the framework includes a multi-component modeling pipeline, consisting of a graph construction module, a temporal encoding module, and a prediction output layer. The model is evaluated on real-world longitudinal Parkinson's disease data. The experiments involve comparisons with mainstream models, sensitivity analysis of hyperparameters, and graph connection density control. Results show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in AUC, RMSE, and IPW-F1 metrics. It effectively distinguishes progression stages and improves the model's ability to capture personalized symptom trajectories. The overall framework demonstrates strong generalization and structural scalability, providing reliable support for intelligent modeling of chronic progressive diseases such as Parkinson's disease.</p></details> |  |

It proposes a fine-tuning algorithm framework based on knowledge graph injection. The method builds on pretrained language models and introduces structured graph information for auxiliary learning. A graph neural network is used to encode entities and their relations, constructing a graph-based semantic representation. A fusion mechanism is then designed to jointly model the knowledge graph embeddings with the contextual representations from the language model. To enhance the robustness of knowledge integration, a gating mechanism is introduced to dynamically balance the contributions of linguistic semantics and structural knowledge. This effectively mitigates conflicts between different representational spaces. During training, a joint loss function is constructed to account for both task performance and structural alignment objectives. This helps improve the accuracy of entity prediction and semantic reasoning. The study also includes a series of systematic sensitivity experiments. It evaluates the effects of learning rate, graph coverage, and structural perturbations on model performance. The results further validate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed method across tasks such as entity recognition, question answering, and language generation. Experimental findings show that the proposed structure-aware fine-tuning framework significantly enhances the model's ability to represent complex semantic units. It demonstrates better semantic consistency and contextual logic modeling in scenarios involving structural reasoning and entity extraction.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Interplay between Graph Structure and Learning Algorithms in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14338v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the interplay between learning algorithms and graph structure for graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing theoretical studies on the learning dynamics of GNNs primarily focus on the convergence rates of learning algorithms under the interpolation regime (noise-free) and offer only a crude connection between these dynamics and the actual graph structure (e.g., maximum degree). This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the excessive risk (generalization performance) of learning algorithms in GNNs within the generalization regime (with noise). Specifically, we extend the conventional settings from the learning theory literature to the context of GNNs and examine how graph structure influences the performance of learning algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Ridge regression. Our study makes several key contributions toward understanding the interplay between graph structure and learning in GNNs. First, we derive the excess risk profiles of SGD and Ridge regression in GNNs and connect these profiles to the graph structure through spectral graph theory. With this established framework, we further explore how different graph structures (regular vs. power-law) impact the performance of these algorithms through comparative analysis. Additionally, we extend our analysis to multi-layer linear GNNs, revealing an increasing non-isotropic effect on the excess risk profile, thereby offering new insights into the over-smoothing issue in GNNs from the perspective of learning algorithms. Our empirical results align with our theoretical predictions, \emph{collectively showcasing a coupling relation among graph structure, GNNs and learning algorithms, and providing insights on GNN algorithm design and selection in practice.}</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14330v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable results in various real-world applications, including drug discovery, object detection, social media analysis, recommender systems, and text classification. In contrast to their vast potential, training them on large-scale graphs presents significant computational challenges due to the resources required for their storage and processing. Graph Condensation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce these demands by learning a synthetic compact graph that preserves the essential information of the original one while maintaining the GNN's predictive performance. Despite their efficacy, current graph condensation approaches frequently rely on a computationally intensive bi-level optimization. Moreover, they fail to maintain a mapping between synthetic and original nodes, limiting the interpretability of the model's decisions. In this sense, a wide range of decomposition techniques have been applied to learn linear or multi-linear functions from graph data, offering a more transparent and less resource-intensive alternative. However, their applicability to graph condensation remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap and proposes a novel method called Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition (GCTD) to investigate to what extent such techniques can synthesize an informative smaller graph and achieve comparable downstream task performance. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GCTD effectively reduces graph size while preserving GNN performance, achieving up to a 4.0\ improvement in accuracy on three out of six datasets and competitive performance on large graphs compared to existing approaches. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/gctd-345A.</p></details> |  |

This work proposes ReviewGraph for Review Rating Prediction (RRP), a novel framework that transforms textual customer reviews into knowledge graphs by extracting (subject, predicate, object) triples and associating sentiment scores. Using graph embeddings (Node2Vec) and sentiment features, the framework predicts review rating scores through machine learning classifiers. We compare ReviewGraph performance with traditional NLP baselines (such as Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec) and large language models (LLMs), evaluating them in the HotelRec dataset. In comparison to the state of the art literature, our proposed model performs similar to their best performing model but with lower computational cost (without ensemble). While ReviewGraph achieves comparable predictive performance to LLMs and outperforms baselines on agreement-based metrics such as Cohen's Kappa, it offers additional advantages in interpretability, visual exploration, and potential integration into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This work highlights the potential of graph-based representations for enhancing review analytics and lays the groundwork for future research integrating advanced graph neural networks and fine-tuned LLM-based extraction methods.

This paper presents a phase-aware, multi-model machine learning framework that emulates adversarial behavior across the seven phases of the Cyber Kill Chain using the MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise dataset. Techniques are semantically mapped to phases via ATTACK-BERT, producing seven phase-specific datasets. We evaluate LightGBM, a custom Transformer encoder, fine-tuned BERT, and a Graph Neural Network (GNN), integrating their outputs through a weighted soft voting ensemble. Inter-phase dependencies are modeled using directed graphs to capture attacker movement from reconnaissance to objectives. The ensemble consistently achieved the highest scores, with F1-scores ranging from 97.47% to 99.83%, surpassing GNN performance (97.36% to 99.81%) by 0.03%--0.20% across phases. This graph-driven, ensemble-based approach enables interpretable attack path forecasting and strengthens proactive cyber defense.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

However, existing approaches typically represent planning states as fully connected graphs, leading to a combinatorial explosion in edge information and substantial sparsity as problem scales grow, especially evident in large grid-based environments. This dense representation results in diluted node-level information, exponentially increases memory requirements, and ultimately makes learning infeasible for larger-scale problems. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse, goal-aware GNN representation that selectively encodes relevant local relationships and explicitly integrates spatial features related to the goal. We validate our approach by designing novel drone mission scenarios based on PDDL within a grid world, effectively simulating realistic mission execution environments. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method scales effectively to larger grid sizes previously infeasible with dense graph representations and substantially improves policy generalization and success rates. Our findings provide a practical foundation for addressing realistic, large-scale generalized planning tasks.</p></details> |  |

The current methods have achieved remarkable success with the powerful structure modeling capability of graph neural networks. However, these methods are often hindered by sparse data in real-world scenarios. Although contrastive learning and homography ( i.e., homogeneous graphs) are employed to address the data sparsity challenge, existing methods still suffer two main limitations: 1) Simple multi-modal feature contrasts fail to produce effective representations, causing noisy modal-shared features and loss of valuable information in modal-unique features; 2) The lack of exploration of the homograph relations between user interests and item co-occurrence results in incomplete mining of user-item interplay. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for \textbf{R}\textbf{E}fining multi-mod\textbf{A}l cont\textbf{R}astive learning and ho\textbf{M}ography relations (\textbf{REARM}). Specifically, we complement multi-modal contrastive learning by employing meta-network and orthogonal constraint strategies, which filter out noise in modal-shared features and retain recommendation-relevant information in modal-unique features. To mine homogeneous relationships effectively, we integrate a newly constructed user interest graph and an item co-occurrence graph with the existing user co-occurrence and item semantic graphs for graph learning. The extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of REARM to various state-of-the-art baselines. Our visualization further shows an improvement made by REARM in distinguishing between modal-shared and modal-unique features.

However, the scalability of full-batch GNN training becomes severely limited by high communication overhead and load imbalance in distributed environments. In this paper, we present CaPGNN, a novel framework for efficient parallel full-batch GNN training on single-server with multi-GPU, designed specifically to reduce redundant inter-GPU communication and balance computational workloads. We propose a joint adaptive caching algorithm that leverages both CPU and GPU memory to significantly reduce the repetitive transmission of vertex features across partitions. Additionally, we introduce a resource-aware graph partitioning algorithm that adjusts subgraph sizes dynamically according to the heterogeneous computational and communication capacities of GPUs. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate that CaPGNN effectively reduces communication costs by up to 96% and accelerates GNN training by up to 12.7 times compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Our results highlight the potential of adaptive caching and resource-aware partitioning to facilitate scalable, efficient, and practical deployment of full-batch GNN training in distributed computing environments.</p></details> |  |

However, existing directed graph neural networks often struggle to jointly capture directional semantics and global structural patterns due to their isotropic aggregation mechanisms and localized filtering mechanisms. To address this limitation, this paper proposes SVDformer, a novel framework that synergizes SVD and Transformer architecture for direction-aware graph representation learning. SVDformer first refines singular value embeddings through multi-head self-attention, adaptively enhancing critical spectral components while suppressing high-frequency noise. This enables learnable low-pass/high-pass graph filtering without requiring spectral kernels. Furthermore, by treating singular vectors as directional projection bases and singular values as scaling factors, SVDformer uses the Transformer to model multi-scale interactions between incoming/outgoing edge patterns through attention weights, thereby explicitly preserving edge directionality during feature propagation. Extensive experiments on six directed graph benchmarks demonstrate that SVDformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and direction-aware baselines on node classification tasks, establishing a new paradigm for learning representations on directed graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[LOOP: A Plug-and-Play Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Enhancing Planning in Autonomous Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13371v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning is one of the most critical tasks in autonomous systems, where even a small error can lead to major failures or million-dollar losses. Current state-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains, producing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and hallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack the flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for modern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot translation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for neural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To address this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework that treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic components rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated neural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships, multi-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical decomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from both successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL specifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds a causal knowledge base from execution traces. LOOP was evaluated on six standard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared to LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%). This work shows that the key to reliable planning is not in choosing between neural networks or symbolic reasoners but it lies in making them actually ``talk'' to each other during the entire process. LOOP provides a thorough blueprint for building autonomous systems that can finally be trusted with critical real-world applications.</p></details> | Submitted to IAAI-26 |

Given a hierarchical representation of the environment, the objective is to navigate from a start position to a goal, while satisfying task-specific safety constraints and minimizing computational cost. We introduce Hierarchical Class-ordered A* (HCOA*), an algorithm that leverages the environment's hierarchy for efficient and safe path-planning in mixed geometric/semantic graphs. We use a total order over the semantic classes and prove theoretical performance guarantees for the algorithm. We propose three approaches for higher-layer node classification based on the semantics of the lowest layer: a Graph Neural Network method, a k-Nearest Neighbors method, and a Majority-Class method. We evaluate HCOA* in simulations on two 3D Scene Graphs, comparing it to the state-of-the-art and assessing the performance of each classification approach. Results show that HCOA* reduces the computational time of navigation by up to 50%, while maintaining near-optimal performance across a wide range of scenarios.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

This issue is particularly pressing in light of the recent growing interest in designing graph foundation models. These models are supposed to be able to transfer to diverse graph datasets from different domains, and yet the proposed graph foundation models are often evaluated on a very limited set of datasets from narrow applications. To alleviate this issue, we introduce GraphLand: a benchmark of 14 diverse graph datasets for node property prediction from a range of different industrial applications. GraphLand allows evaluating graph ML models on a wide range of graphs with diverse sizes, structural characteristics, and feature sets, all in a unified setting. Further, GraphLand allows investigating such previously underexplored research questions as how realistic temporal distributional shifts under transductive and inductive settings influence graph ML model performance. To mimic realistic industrial settings, we use GraphLand to compare GNNs with gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT) models that are popular in industrial applications and show that GBDTs provided with additional graph-based input features can sometimes be very strong baselines. Further, we evaluate currently available general-purpose graph foundation models and find that they fail to produce competitive results on our proposed datasets.</p></details> |  |

Existing defenses mitigate these attacks by manipulating probe delays to mislead inference, but rely on two strong assumptions: (i) probe packets can be perfectly detected and altered, and (ii) attackers use known, fixed inference algorithms. These assumptions often break in practice, leading to degraded defense performance under detection errors or adaptive adversaries. We present RoTO, a robust topology obfuscation scheme that eliminates both assumptions by modeling uncertainty in attacker-observed delays through a distributional formulation. RoTO casts the defense objective as a min-max optimization problem that maximizes expected topological distortion across this uncertainty set, without relying on perfect probe control or specific attacker models. To approximate attacker behavior, RoTO leverages graph neural networks for inference simulation and adversarial training. We also derive an upper bound on attacker success probability, and demonstrate that our approach enhances topology obfuscation performance through the optimization of this upper bound. Experimental results show that RoTO outperforms existing defense methods, achieving average improvements of 34% in structural similarity and 42.6% in link distance while maintaining strong robustness and concealment capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Multi-Agent Epistemic Planning through GNN-Derived Heuristics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12840v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent Epistemic Planning (MEP) is an autonomous planning framework for reasoning about both the physical world and the beliefs of agents, with applications in domains where information flow and awareness among agents are critical. The richness of MEP requires states to be represented as Kripke structures, i.e., directed labeled graphs. This representation limits the applicability of existing heuristics, hindering the scalability of epistemic solvers, which must explore an exponential search space without guidance, resulting often in intractability. To address this, we exploit Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn patterns and relational structures within epistemic states, to guide the planning process. GNNs, which naturally capture the graph-like nature of Kripke models, allow us to derive meaningful estimates of state quality -- e.g., the distance from the nearest goal -- by generalizing knowledge obtained from previously solved planning instances. We integrate these predictive heuristics into an epistemic planning pipeline and evaluate them against standard baselines, showing significant improvements in the scalability of multi-agent epistemic planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Modeling of Full-Atom Protein Conformations using Latent Diffusion on Graph Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17064v4)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating diverse, all-atom conformational ensembles of dynamic proteins such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is critical for understanding their function, yet most generative models simplify atomic detail or ignore conformational diversity altogether. We present latent diffusion for full protein generation (LD-FPG), a framework that constructs complete all-atom protein structures, including every side-chain heavy atom, directly from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph neural network (ChebNet) to obtain low-dimensional latent embeddings of protein conformations, which are processed using three pooling strategies: blind, sequential and residue-based. A diffusion model trained on these latent representations generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized by dihedral-angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates. Using D2R-MD, a 2-microsecond MD trajectory (12 000 frames) of the human dopamine D2 receptor in a membrane environment, the sequential and residue-based pooling strategy reproduces the reference ensemble with high structural fidelity (all-atom lDDT of approximately 0.7; C-alpha-lDDT of approximately 0.8) and recovers backbone and side-chain dihedral-angle distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence of less than 0.03 compared to the MD data. LD-FPG thereby offers a practical route to system-specific, all-atom ensemble generation for large proteins, providing a promising tool for structure-based therapeutic design on complex, dynamic targets. The D2R-MD dataset and our implementation are freely available to facilitate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (main text), 4 figures, 2 tables.

| **[S2FGL: Spatial Spectral Federated Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02409v4)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Graph Learning (FGL) combines the privacy-preserving capabilities of federated learning (FL) with the strong graph modeling capability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Current research addresses subgraph-FL from the structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label signals and a degradation in the semantic knowledge of the global GNN. From a spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drift occurs, undermining global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global knowledge repository to mitigate the challenge of poor semantic knowledge caused by label signal disruption. Furthermore, we design a frequency alignment to address spectral client drift. The combination of Spatial and Spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL. The code is available at https://github.com/Wonder7racer/S2FGL.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[MPOCryptoML: Multi-Pattern based Off-Chain Crypto Money Laundering Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12641v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in money laundering detection have demonstrated the potential of using graph neural networks to capture laundering patterns accurately. However, existing models are not explicitly designed to detect the diverse patterns of off-chain cryptocurrency money laundering. Neglecting any laundering pattern introduces critical detection gaps, as each pattern reflects unique transactional structures that facilitate the obfuscation of illicit fund origins and movements. Failure to account for these patterns may result in under-detection or omission of specific laundering activities, diminishing model accuracy and allowing schemes to bypass detection. To address this gap, we propose the MPOCryptoML model to effectively detect multiple laundering patterns in cryptocurrency transactions. MPOCryptoML includes the development of a multi-source Personalized PageRank algorithm to identify random laundering patterns. Additionally, we introduce two novel algorithms by analyzing the timestamp and weight of transactions in high-volume financial networks to detect various money laundering structures, including fan-in, fan-out, bipartite, gather-scatter, and stack patterns. We further examine correlations between these patterns using a logistic regression model. An anomaly score function integrates results from each module to rank accounts by anomaly score, systematically identifying high-risk accounts. Extensive experiments on public datasets including Elliptic++, Ethereum fraud detection, and Wormhole transaction datasets validate the efficacy and efficiency of MPOCryptoML. Results show consistent performance gains, with improvements up to 9.13% in precision, up to 10.16% in recall, up to 7.63% in F1-score, and up to 10.19% in accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Toward this goal, significant effort has focused on developing models that jointly sample molecular topology and 3D structure. We present FlowMol3, an open-source, multi-modal flow matching model that advances the state of the art for all-atom, small-molecule generation. Its substantial performance gains over previous FlowMol versions are achieved without changes to the graph neural network architecture or the underlying flow matching formulation. Instead, FlowMol3's improvements arise from three architecture-agnostic techniques that incur negligible computational cost: self-conditioning, fake atoms, and train-time geometry distortion. FlowMol3 achieves nearly 100% molecular validity for drug-like molecules with explicit hydrogens, more accurately reproduces the functional group composition and geometry of its training data, and does so with an order of magnitude fewer learnable parameters than comparable methods. We hypothesize that these techniques mitigate a general pathology affecting transport-based generative models, enabling detection and correction of distribution drift during inference. Our results highlight simple, transferable strategies for improving the stability and quality of diffusion- and flow-based molecular generative models.</p></details> |  |

Central to this effort is the development of invariant and equivariant operations. This works presents a systematic method for constructing valid invariant and equivariant operations. It can handle inputs and outputs in the form of Cartesian tensors with different rank, as well as spherical tensors with different types. In addition, our method features a graphical representation utilizing the symmetric tensor network, which simplifies both the proofs and constructions related to invariant and equivariant functions. We also apply this approach to design the equivariant interaction message for the geometry graph neural network, and equivariant machine learning model to learn the constitutive law of materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Consumer-Grade Cybersickness Prediction: Multi-Model Alignment for Real-Time Vision-Only Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01212v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cybersickness remains a major obstacle to the widespread adoption of immersive virtual reality (VR), particularly in consumer-grade environments. While prior methods rely on invasive signals such as electroencephalography (EEG) for high predictive accuracy, these approaches require specialized hardware and are impractical for real-world applications. In this work, we propose a scalable, deployable framework for personalized cybersickness prediction leveraging only non-invasive signals readily available from commercial VR headsets, including head motion, eye tracking, and physiological responses. Our model employs a modality-specific graph neural network enhanced with a Difference Attention Module to extract temporal-spatial embeddings capturing dynamic changes across modalities. A cross-modal alignment module jointly trains the video encoder to learn personalized traits by aligning video features with sensor-derived representations. Consequently, the model accurately predicts individual cybersickness using only video input during inference. Experimental results show our model achieves 88.4\% accuracy, closely matching EEG-based approaches (89.16\%), while reducing deployment complexity. With an average inference latency of 90ms, our framework supports real-time applications, ideal for integration into consumer-grade VR platforms without compromising personalization or performance. The code will be relesed at https://github.com/U235-Aurora/PTGNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[SGPT: Few-Shot Prompt Tuning for Signed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12155v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) are effective in learning expressive representations for signed graphs but typically require substantial task-specific labels, limiting their applicability in label-scarce industrial scenarios. In contrast, unsigned graph structures are abundant and can be readily leveraged to pre-train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offering a promising solution to reduce supervision requirements in downstream signed graph tasks. However, transferring knowledge from unsigned to signed graphs is non-trivial due to the fundamental discrepancies in graph types and task objectives between pre-training and downstream phases. To address this challenge, we propose Signed Graph Prompt Tuning (SGPT), a novel graph prompting framework that adapts pre-trained unsigned GNNs to few-shot signed graph tasks. We first design a graph template based on balance theory to disentangle mixed node relationships introduced by negative links, mitigating the structural mismatches between unsigned and signed graphs. We further introduce a task template that reformulates downstream signed tasks into a unified link prediction objective, aligning their optimization goals with the pre-training task. Furthermore, we develop feature prompts that align downstream semantic spaces with the feature spaces learned during pre-training, and semantic prompts to integrate link sign semantics in a task-aware manner. We conduct extensive experiments on seven benchmark signed graph datasets, demonstrating that SGPT significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, establishing a powerful and generalizable solution for few-shot signed graph learning.</p></details> | CIKM'25 |
| **[CRoC: Context Refactoring Contrast for Graph Anomaly Detection with Limited Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12278v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used as the engine for various graph-related tasks, with their effectiveness in analyzing graph-structured data. However, training robust GNNs often demands abundant labeled data, which is a critical bottleneck in real-world applications. This limitation severely impedes progress in Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD), where anomalies are inherently rare, costly to label, and may actively camouflage their patterns to evade detection. To address these problems, we propose Context Refactoring Contrast (CRoC), a simple yet effective framework that trains GNNs for GAD by jointly leveraging limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. Different from previous works, CRoC exploits the class imbalance inherent in GAD to refactor the context of each node, which builds augmented graphs by recomposing the attributes of nodes while preserving their interaction patterns. Furthermore, CRoC encodes heterogeneous relations separately and integrates them into the message-passing process, enhancing the model's capacity to capture complex interaction semantics. These operations preserve node semantics while encouraging robustness to adversarial camouflage, enabling GNNs to uncover intricate anomalous cases. In the training stage, CRoC is further integrated with the contrastive learning paradigm. This allows GNNs to effectively harness unlabeled data during joint training, producing richer, more discriminative node embeddings. CRoC is evaluated on seven real-world GAD datasets with varying scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CRoC achieves up to 14% AUC improvement over baseline GNNs and outperforms state-of-the-art GAD methods under limited-label settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECAI 2025</p></details> |

While adhering to an assigned travel budget the algorithm seeks to maximize collected reward while incurring stochastic travel costs. In this context, the acceptable probability of exceeding the assigned budget is expressed as a chance constraint. Our MCTS solution is an online and anytime algorithm alternating planning and execution that determines the next vertex to visit by continuously monitoring the remaining travel budget. The novelty of our work is that the rollout phase in the MCTS framework is implemented using a message passing GNN, predicting both the utility and failure probability of each available action. This allows to enormously expedite the search process. Our experimental evaluation shows that with the proposed method and architecture we manage to efficiently solve complex problem instances while incurring in moderate losses in terms of collected reward. Moreover, we demonstrate how the approach is capable of generalizing beyond the characteristics of the training dataset.

| **[Implicit Hypergraph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14101v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hypergraphs offer a generalized framework for capturing high-order relationships between entities and have been widely applied in various domains, including healthcare, social networks, and bioinformatics. Hypergraph neural networks, which rely on message-passing between nodes over hyperedges to learn latent representations, have emerged as the method of choice for predictive tasks in many of these domains. These approaches typically perform only a small number of message-passing rounds to learn the representations, which they then utilize for predictions. The small number of message-passing rounds comes at a cost, as the representations only capture local information and forego long-range high-order dependencies. However, as we demonstrate, blindly increasing the message-passing rounds to capture long-range dependency also degrades the performance of hyper-graph neural networks. Recent works have demonstrated that implicit graph neural networks capture long-range dependencies in standard graphs while maintaining performance. Despite their popularity, prior work has not studied long-range dependency issues on hypergraph neural networks. Here, we first demonstrate that existing hypergraph neural networks lose predictive power when aggregating more information to capture long-range dependency. We then propose Implicit Hypergraph Neural Network (IHNN), a novel framework that jointly learns fixed-point representations for both nodes and hyperedges in an end-to-end manner to alleviate this issue. Leveraging implicit differentiation, we introduce a tractable projected gradient descent approach to train the model efficiently. Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs for node classification demonstrate that IHNN outperforms the closest prior works in most settings, establishing a new state-of-the-art in hypergraph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICDM 2025</p></details> |

However, current reasoning models often lack explicit semantic hierarchies, user-domain knowledge alignment, and principled mechanisms to prune reasoning threads for effectiveness. These limitations result in lengthy generic output that does not guide users through goal-oriented reasoning steps. To address this, we propose a prototype-inspired, two-phases Reasoning-Threads-Evaluation (ReT-Eval) framework, drawing inspiration from human-like reasoning strategies that emphasize structured knowledge reuse. In the first phase, semantically relevant knowledge structures are extracted from a sparse domain knowledge graph using a graph neural network and enriched with intrinsic large language model knowledge to resolve knowledge discrepancies. In the second phase, these threads are evaluated and pruned using a reward-guided strategy aimed at maintaining semantic coherence to generate effective reasoning threads. Experiments and expert evaluations show that ReT-Eval enhances user understanding and outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 1 figure, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Graph Neural Poisson Models for Supply Chain Relationship Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12044v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In supply chain networks, firms dynamically form or dissolve partnerships to adapt to market fluctuations, posing a challenge for predicting future supply relationships. We model the occurrence of supply edges (firm i to firm j) as a non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP), using historical event counts to estimate the Poisson intensity function up to time t. However, forecasting future intensities is hindered by the limitations of historical data alone. To overcome this, we propose a novel Graph Double Exponential Smoothing (GDES) model, which integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with a nonparametric double exponential smoothing approach to predict the probability of future supply edge formations.Recognizing the interdependent economic dynamics between upstream and downstream firms, we assume that the Poisson intensity functions of supply edges are correlated, aligning with the non-homogeneous nature of the process.Our model is interpretable, decomposing intensity increments into contributions from the current edge's historical data and influences from neighboring edges in the supply chain network. Evaluated on a large-scale supply chain dataset with 87,969 firms, our approach achieves an AUC of 93.84 % in dynamic link prediction, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing complex supply chain interactions for accurate forecasting.</p></details> | 17 pages, 2 figures |
| **[OneForecast: A Universal Framework for Global and Regional Weather Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00338v3)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate weather forecasts are important for disaster prevention, agricultural planning, etc. Traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods offer physically interpretable high-accuracy predictions but are computationally expensive and fail to fully leverage rapidly growing historical data. In recent years, deep learning models have made significant progress in weather forecasting, but challenges remain, such as balancing global and regional high-resolution forecasts, excessive smoothing in extreme event predictions, and insufficient dynamic system modeling. To address these issues, this paper proposes a global-regional nested weather forecasting framework (OneForecast) based on graph neural networks. By combining a dynamic system perspective with multi-grid theory, we construct a multi-scale graph structure and densify the target region to capture local high-frequency features. We introduce an adaptive messaging mechanism, using dynamic gating units to deeply integrate node and edge features for more accurate extreme event forecasting. For high-resolution regional forecasts, we propose a neural nested grid method to mitigate boundary information loss. Experimental results show that OneForecast performs excellently across global to regional scales and short-term to long-term forecasts, especially in extreme event predictions.

Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds promise for developing objective, scalable, and timely diagnostic tools. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art AI methods for depression detection and diagnosis, based on a systematic review of 55 key studies. We introduce a novel hierarchical taxonomy that structures the field by primary clinical task (diagnosis vs. prediction), data modality (text, speech, neuroimaging, multimodal), and computational model class (e.g., graph neural networks, large language models, hybrid approaches). Our in-depth analysis reveals three major trends: the predominance of graph neural networks for modeling brain connectivity, the rise of large language models for linguistic and conversational data, and an emerging focus on multimodal fusion, explainability, and algorithmic fairness. Alongside methodological insights, we provide an overview of prominent public datasets and standard evaluation metrics as a practical guide for researchers. By synthesizing current advances and highlighting open challenges, this survey offers a comprehensive roadmap for future innovation in computational psychiatry.</p></details> |  |
| **[STRIDE: Structure and Embedding Distillation with Attention for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15938v2)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have led to increased model sizes to enhance their capacity and accuracy. Such large models incur high memory usage, latency, and computational costs, thereby restricting their inference deployment. GNN compression techniques compress large GNNs into smaller ones with negligible accuracy loss. One of the most promising compression techniques is knowledge distillation (KD). However, most KD approaches for GNNs only consider the outputs of the last layers and do not consider the outputs of the intermediate layers of the GNNs. The intermediate layers may contain important inductive biases indicated by the graph structure and embeddings. Ignoring these layers may lead to a high accuracy drop, especially when the compression ratio is high. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel KD approach for GNN compression that we call Structure and Embedding Distillation with Attention (STRIDE). STRIDE utilizes attention to identify important intermediate teacher-student layer pairs and focuses on using those pairs to align graph structure and node embeddings. We evaluate STRIDE on several datasets, such as OGBN-Mag and OGBN-Arxiv, using different model architectures, including GCNIIs, RGCNs, and GraphSAGE. On average, STRIDE achieves a 2.13% increase in accuracy with a 32.3X compression ratio on OGBN-Mag, a large graph dataset, compared to state-of-the-art approaches. On smaller datasets (e.g., Pubmed), STRIDE achieves up to a 141X compression ratio with the same accuracy as state-of-the-art approaches. These results highlight the effectiveness of focusing on intermediate-layer knowledge to obtain compact, accurate, and practical GNN models.</p></details> |  |

Previous work applied GNNs to image-derived graph representations for various downstream tasks such as classification or anomaly detection. These transformations include segmenting images, extracting features from segments, mapping them to nodes, and connecting them. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has rigorously compared the effectiveness of the numerous potential image-to-graph transformation approaches for GNN-based graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD). In this study, we systematically evaluate the efficacy of multiple segmentation schemes, edge construction strategies, and node feature sets based on color, texture, and shape descriptors to produce suitable image-derived graph representations to perform graph-level anomaly detection. We conduct extensive experiments on dermoscopic images using state-of-the-art GLAD models, examining performance and efficiency in purely unsupervised, weakly supervised, and fully supervised regimes. Our findings reveal, for example, that color descriptors contribute the best standalone performance, while incorporating shape and texture features consistently enhances detection efficacy. In particular, our best unsupervised configuration using OCGTL achieves a competitive AUC-ROC score of up to 0.805 without relying on pretrained backbones like comparable image-based approaches. With the inclusion of sparse labels, the performance increases substantially to 0.872 and with full supervision to 0.914 AUC-ROC.</p></details> |  |

With upgrades scheduled for the detectors of colliding-beam experiments around the world, and specifically at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, more collisions and more complex interactions are expected. This directly implies an increase in data produced and consequently in the computational resources needed to process them. At CERN, the amount of data produced is gargantuan. This is why the data have to be heavily filtered and selected in real time before being permanently stored. This data can then be used to perform physics analyses, in order to expand our current understanding of the universe and improve the Standard Model of physics. This real-time filtering, known as triggering, involves complex processing happening often at frequencies as high as 40 MHz. This thesis contributes to understanding how machine learning models can be efficiently deployed in such environments, in order to maximize throughput and minimize energy consumption. Inevitably, modern hardware designed for such tasks and contemporary algorithms are needed in order to meet the challenges posed by the stringent, high-frequency data rates. In this work, I present our graph neural network-based pipeline, developed for charged particle track reconstruction at the LHCb experiment at CERN. The pipeline was implemented end-to-end inside LHCb's first-level trigger, entirely on GPUs. Its performance was compared against the classical tracking algorithms currently in production at LHCb.

Recent work has introduced self-explainable GNNs that generate explanations as part of training, improving both faithfulness and efficiency. Some of these models, such as ProtGNN and PGIB, learn class-specific prototypes, offering a potential pathway toward class-level explanations. However, their evaluations focus solely on instance-level explanations, leaving open the question of whether these prototypes meaningfully generalize across instances of the same class. In this paper, we introduce GraphOracle, a novel self-explainable GNN framework designed to generate and evaluate class-level explanations for GNNs. Our model jointly learns a GNN classifier and a set of structured, sparse subgraphs that are discriminative for each class. We propose a novel integrated training that captures graph$\unicode{x2013}$subgraph$\unicode{x2013}$prediction dependencies efficiently and faithfully, validated through a masking-based evaluation strategy. This strategy enables us to retroactively assess whether prior methods like ProtGNN and PGIB deliver effective class-level explanations. Our results show that they do not. In contrast, GraphOracle achieves superior fidelity, explainability, and scalability across a range of graph classification tasks. We further demonstrate that GraphOracle avoids the computational bottlenecks of previous methods$\unicode{x2014}$like Monte Carlo Tree Search$\unicode{x2014}$by using entropy-regularized subgraph selection and lightweight random walk extraction, enabling faster and more scalable training. These findings position GraphOracle as a practical and principled solution for faithful class-level self-explainability in GNNs.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Discovering Invariant Neighborhood Patterns for Heterophilic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10572v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the problem of distribution shifts on non-homophilous graphs Mosting existing graph neural network methods rely on the homophilous assumption that nodes from the same class are more likely to be linked. However, such assumptions of homophily do not always hold in real-world graphs, which leads to more complex distribution shifts unaccounted for in previous methods. The distribution shifts of neighborhood patterns are much more diverse on non-homophilous graphs. We propose a novel Invariant Neighborhood Pattern Learning (INPL) to alleviate the distribution shifts problem on non-homophilous graphs. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive Neighborhood Propagation (ANP) module to capture the adaptive neighborhood information, which could alleviate the neighborhood pattern distribution shifts problem on non-homophilous graphs. We propose Invariant Non-Homophilous Graph Learning (INHGL) module to constrain the ANP and learn invariant graph representation on non-homophilous graphs. Extensive experimental results on real-world non-homophilous graphs show that INPL could achieve state-of-the-art performance for learning on large non-homophilous graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Sensory Cognitive Computing for Learning Population-level Brain Connectivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11436v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generation of connectional brain templates (CBTs) has recently garnered significant attention for its potential to identify unique connectivity patterns shared across individuals. However, existing methods for CBT learning such as conventional machine learning and graph neural networks (GNNs) are hindered by several limitations. These include: (i) poor interpretability due to their black-box nature, (ii) high computational cost, and (iii) an exclusive focus on structure and topology, overlooking the cognitive capacity of the generated CBT. To address these challenges, we introduce mCOCO (multi-sensory COgnitive COmputing), a novel framework that leverages Reservoir Computing (RC) to learn population-level functional CBT from BOLD (Blood-Oxygen-level-Dependent) signals. RC's dynamic system properties allow for tracking state changes over time, enhancing interpretability and enabling the modeling of brain-like dynamics, as demonstrated in prior literature. By integrating multi-sensory inputs (e.g., text, audio, and visual data), mCOCO captures not only structure and topology but also how brain regions process information and adapt to cognitive tasks such as sensory processing, all in a computationally efficient manner. Our mCOCO framework consists of two phases: (1) mapping BOLD signals into the reservoir to derive individual functional connectomes, which are then aggregated into a group-level CBT - an approach, to the best of our knowledge, not previously explored in functional connectivity studies - and (2) incorporating multi-sensory inputs through a cognitive reservoir, endowing the CBT with cognitive traits. Extensive evaluations show that our mCOCO-based template significantly outperforms GNN-based CBT in terms of centeredness, discriminativeness, topological soundness, and multi-sensory memory retention. Our source code is available at https://github.com/basiralab/mCOCO.</p></details> |  |

This is particularly evident when this task is tackled by graph neural networks, since they rely on an inherently local message passing scheme to learn the node representations that serve to cluster nodes into communities. In this work, we argue that the ability to propagate long-range information during message passing is key to effectively perform community detection in heterophilic graphs. To this end, we introduce the Unsupervised Antisymmetric Graph Neural Network (uAGNN), a novel unsupervised community detection approach leveraging non-dissipative dynamical systems to ensure stability and to propagate long-range information effectively. By employing antisymmetric weight matrices, uAGNN captures both local and global graph structures, overcoming the limitations posed by heterophilic scenarios. Extensive experiments across ten datasets demonstrate uAGNN's superior performance in high and medium heterophilic settings, where traditional methods fail to exploit long-range dependencies. These results highlight uAGNN's potential as a powerful tool for unsupervised community detection in diverse graph environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

However, many real-world systems, such as social or biological networks, exhibit complex interactions that are more naturally represented by higher-order topological domains. The emerging field of Geometric and Topological Deep Learning addresses this challenge by introducing methods that utilize and benefit from higher-order structures. Central to TDL is the concept of lifting, which transforms data representations from basic graph forms to more expressive topologies before the application of GNN models for learning. In this work, we propose a structural lifting strategy using Forman-Ricci curvature, which defines an edge-based network characteristic based on Riemannian geometry. Curvature reveals local and global properties of a graph, such as a network's backbones, i.e. coarse, structure-preserving graph geometries that form connections between major communities - most suitably represented as hyperedges to model information flows between clusters across large distances in the network. To this end, our approach provides a remedy to the problem of information distortion in message passing across long distances and graph bottlenecks - a phenomenon known in graph learning as over-squashing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Diffusion via Generalized Opinion Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11249v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a growing interest in developing diffusion-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), building on the connections between message passing mechanisms in GNNs and physical diffusion processes. However, existing methods suffer from three critical limitations: (1) they rely on homogeneous diffusion with static dynamics, limiting adaptability to diverse graph structures; (2) their depth is constrained by computational overhead and diminishing interpretability; and (3) theoretical understanding of their convergence behavior remains limited. To address these challenges, we propose GODNF, a Generalized Opinion Dynamics Neural Framework, which unifies multiple opinion dynamics models into a principled, trainable diffusion mechanism. Our framework captures heterogeneous diffusion patterns and temporal dynamics via node-specific behavior modeling and dynamic neighborhood influence, while ensuring efficient and interpretable message propagation even at deep layers. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating GODNF's ability to model diverse convergence configurations. Extensive empirical evaluations of node classification and influence estimation tasks confirm GODNF's superiority over state-of-the-art GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Heuristics to Data: Quantifying Site Planning Layout Indicators with Deep Learning and Multi-Modal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11723v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatial layout of urban sites shapes land-use efficiency and spatial organization. Traditional site planning often relies on experiential judgment and single-source data, limiting systematic quantification of multifunctional layouts. We propose a Site Planning Layout Indicator (SPLI) system, a data-driven framework integrating empirical knowledge with heterogeneous multi-source data to produce structured urban spatial information. The SPLI supports multimodal spatial data systems for analytics, inference, and retrieval by combining OpenStreetMap (OSM), Points of Interest (POI), building morphology, land use, and satellite imagery. It extends conventional metrics through five dimensions: (1) Hierarchical Building Function Classification, refining empirical systems into clear hierarchies; (2) Spatial Organization, quantifying seven layout patterns (e.g., symmetrical, concentric, axial-oriented); (3) Functional Diversity, transforming qualitative assessments into measurable indicators using Functional Ratio (FR) and Simpson Index (SI); (4) Accessibility to Essential Services, integrating facility distribution and transport networks for comprehensive accessibility metrics; and (5) Land Use Intensity, using Floor Area Ratio (FAR) and Building Coverage Ratio (BCR) to assess utilization efficiency. Data gaps are addressed through deep learning, including Relational Graph Neural Networks (RGNN) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Experiments show the SPLI improves functional classification accuracy and provides a standardized basis for automated, data-driven urban spatial analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 32 figures, submitted to Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science</p></details> |
| **[A Coarse-to-Fine Human Pose Estimation Method based on Two-stage Distillation and Progressive Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11212v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation has been widely applied in the human-centric understanding and generation, but most existing state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods require heavy computational resources for accurate predictions. In order to obtain an accurate, robust yet lightweight human pose estimator, one feasible way is to transfer pose knowledge from a powerful teacher model to a less-parameterized student model by knowledge distillation. However, the traditional knowledge distillation framework does not fully explore the contextual information among human joints. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine two-stage knowledge distillation framework for human pose estimation. In the first-stage distillation, we introduce the human joints structure loss to mine the structural information among human joints so as to transfer high-level semantic knowledge from the teacher model to the student model. In the second-stage distillation, we utilize an Image-Guided Progressive Graph Convolutional Network (IGP-GCN) to refine the initial human pose obtained from the first-stage distillation and supervise the training of the IGP-GCN in the progressive way by the final output pose of teacher model. The extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset: COCO keypoint and CrowdPose datasets, show that our proposed method performs favorably against lots of the existing state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods, especially for the more complex CrowdPose dataset, the performance improvement of our model is more significant.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable Attention-Guided Stacked Graph Neural Networks for Malware Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09801v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Malware detection in modern computing environments demands models that are not only accurate but also interpretable and robust to evasive techniques. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in this domain by modeling rich structural dependencies in graph-based program representations such as control flow graphs (CFGs). However, single-model approaches may suffer from limited generalization and lack interpretability, especially in high-stakes security applications. In this paper, we propose a novel stacking ensemble framework for graph-based malware detection and explanation. Our method dynamically extracts CFGs from portable executable (PE) files and encodes their basic blocks through a two-step embedding strategy. A set of diverse GNN base learners, each with a distinct message-passing mechanism, is used to capture complementary behavioral features. Their prediction outputs are aggregated by a meta-learner implemented as an attention-based multilayer perceptron, which both classifies malware instances and quantifies the contribution of each base model. To enhance explainability, we introduce an ensemble-aware post-hoc explanation technique that leverages edge-level importance scores generated by a GNN explainer and fuses them using the learned attention weights. This produces interpretable, model-agnostic explanations aligned with the final ensemble decision. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework improves classification performance while providing insightful interpretations of malware behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Fairness in Autoencoders for Node-Level Graph Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10785v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has become an increasingly important task across various domains. With the rapid development of graph neural networks (GNNs), GAD methods have achieved significant performance improvements. However, fairness considerations in GAD remain largely underexplored. Indeed, GNN-based GAD models can inherit and amplify biases present in training data, potentially leading to unfair outcomes. While existing efforts have focused on developing fair GNNs, most approaches target node classification tasks, where models often rely on simple layer architectures rather than autoencoder-based structures, which are the most widely used architecturs for anomaly detection. To address fairness in autoencoder-based GAD models, we propose \textbf{D}is\textbf{E}ntangled \textbf{C}ounterfactual \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{F}air (DECAF)-GAD, a framework that alleviates bias while preserving GAD performance. Specifically, we introduce a structural causal model (SCM) to disentangle sensitive attributes from learned representations. Based on this causal framework, we formulate a specialized autoencoder architecture along with a fairness-guided loss function. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that DECAF-GAD not only achieves competitive anomaly detection performance but also significantly enhances fairness metrics compared to baseline GAD methods.
