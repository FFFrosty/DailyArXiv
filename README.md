| **[ChronoGraph: A Real-World Graph-Based Multivariate Time Series Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04449v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present ChronoGraph, a graph-structured multivariate time series forecasting dataset built from real-world production microservices. Each node is a service that emits a multivariate stream of system-level performance metrics, capturing CPU, memory, and network usage patterns, while directed edges encode dependencies between services. The primary task is forecasting future values of these signals at the service level. In addition, ChronoGraph provides expert-annotated incident windows as anomaly labels, enabling evaluation of anomaly detection methods and assessment of forecast robustness during operational disruptions. Compared to existing benchmarks from industrial control systems or traffic and air-quality domains, ChronoGraph uniquely combines (i) multivariate time series, (ii) an explicit, machine-readable dependency graph, and (iii) anomaly labels aligned with real incidents. We report baseline results spanning forecasting models, pretrained time-series foundation models, and standard anomaly detectors. ChronoGraph offers a realistic benchmark for studying structure-aware forecasting and incident-aware evaluation in microservice systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[History matching for functional data and its application to tsunami warnings in the Indian Ocean](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04342v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional History Matching (HM) identifies implausible regions of the input parameter space by comparing scalar outputs of a computer model to observations. It offers higher computational efficiency than Bayesian calibration, making it suitable for high-dimensional problems. However, in real physical systems, outputs are often functional, such as time series or spatial fields, and conventional HM cannot fully exploit such information. We propose a novel method, Functional History Matching (FHM), which extends HM to handle functional data. FHM incorporates the Outer Product Emulator, an extension of the Gaussian Process emulator designed for time series, to enhance computational efficiency. FHM also leverages Random Projection to extract dynamic features from infinite-dimensional data, including derivatives. FHM supports uncertainty quantification essential for decision-making and naturally accommodates model discrepancies. To demonstrate its practical effectiveness, we apply FHM to a synthetic tsunami forecasting scenario in the Indian Ocean, assuming a realistic event in the Makran subduction zone. Wave elevation time series from offshore buoy data are used to predict wave elevations over the Indian coastline. Our results show that FHM significantly outperforms scalar-based HM in accuracy. FHM enables reliable forecasting from functional data within feasible computational constraints, offering a robust framework for early warning systems and beyond.</p></details> | 56 pages, 20 figures |
| **[One-Embedding-Fits-All: Efficient Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasting by a Model Zoo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04208v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) has significantly advanced zero-shot forecasting, enabling predictions for unseen time series without task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive research has confirmed that no single TSFM excels universally, as different models exhibit preferences for distinct temporal patterns. This diversity suggests an opportunity: how to take advantage of the complementary abilities of TSFMs. To this end, we propose ZooCast, which characterizes each model's distinct forecasting strengths. ZooCast can intelligently assemble current TSFMs into a model zoo that dynamically selects optimal models for different forecasting tasks. Our key innovation lies in the One-Embedding-Fits-All paradigm that constructs a unified representation space where each model in the zoo is represented by a single embedding, enabling efficient similarity matching for all tasks. Experiments demonstrate ZooCast's strong performance on the GIFT-Eval zero-shot forecasting benchmark while maintaining the efficiency of a single TSFM. In real-world scenarios with sequential model releases, the framework seamlessly adds new models for progressive accuracy gains with negligible overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy Risks in Time Series Forecasting: User- and Record-Level Membership Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04169v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether specific data were used to train a model. While extensively studied on classification models, their impact on time series forecasting remains largely unexplored. We address this gap by introducing two new attacks: (i) an adaptation of multivariate LiRA, a state-of-the-art MIA originally developed for classification models, to the time-series forecasting setting, and (ii) a novel end-to-end learning approach called Deep Time Series (DTS) attack. We benchmark these methods against adapted versions of other leading attacks from the classification setting. We evaluate all attacks in realistic settings on the TUH-EEG and ELD datasets, targeting two strong forecasting architectures, LSTM and the state-of-the-art N-HiTS, under both record- and user-level threat models. Our results show that forecasting models are vulnerable, with user-level attacks often achieving perfect detection. The proposed methods achieve the strongest performance in several settings, establishing new baselines for privacy risk assessment in time series forecasting. Furthermore, vulnerability increases with longer prediction horizons and smaller training populations, echoing trends observed in large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic QoS Metric Forecasting in Delay-Tolerant Networks Using Conditional Diffusion Models on Latent Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08821v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active QoS metric prediction, commonly employed in the maintenance and operation of DTN, could enhance network performance regarding latency, throughput, energy consumption, and dependability. Naturally formulated as a multivariate time series forecasting problem, it attracts substantial research efforts. Traditional mean regression methods for time series forecasting cannot capture the data complexity adequately, resulting in deteriorated performance in operational tasks in DTNs such as routing. This paper formulates the prediction of QoS metrics in DTN as a probabilistic forecasting problem on multivariate time series, where one could quantify the uncertainty of forecasts by characterizing the distribution of these samples. The proposed approach hires diffusion models and incorporates the latent temporal dynamics of non-stationary and multi-mode data into them. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach by showing that it outperforms the popular probabilistic time series forecasting methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial disaggregation of time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04065v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal modeling of economic aggregates is increasingly relevant in regional science due to the presence of both spatial spillovers and temporal dynamics. Traditional temporal disaggregation methods, such as Chow-Lin, often ignore spatial dependence, potentially losing important regional information. We propose a novel methodology for spatiotemporal disaggregation, integrating spatial autoregressive models, benchmarking restrictions, and auxiliary covariates. The approach accommodates partially observed regional data through an anchoring mechanism, ensuring consistency with known aggregates while reducing prediction variance. We establish identifiability and asymptotic normality of the estimator under general conditions, including non-Gaussian and heteroskedastic residuals. Extensive simulations confirm the method's robustness across a wide range of spatial autocorrelations and covariate informativeness. The methodology is illustrated by disaggregating Spanish GDP into 17 autonomous communities from 2002 to 2023, using auxiliary indicators and principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction. This framework extends classical temporal disaggregation to the spatial domain, providing accurate regional estimates while accounting for spatial spillovers and irregular data availability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Generative Models Meet Compressed Sensing, with Applications to Image Data and Financial Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03898v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper develops dimension reduction techniques for accelerating diffusion model inference in the context of synthetic data generation. The idea is to integrate compressed sensing into diffusion models: (i) compress the data into a latent space, (ii) train a diffusion model in the latent space, and (iii) apply a compressed sensing algorithm to the samples generated in the latent space, facilitating the efficiency of both model training and inference. Under suitable sparsity assumptions on data, the proposed algorithm is proved to enjoy faster convergence by combining diffusion model inference with sparse recovery. As a byproduct, we obtain an optimal value for the latent space dimension. We also conduct numerical experiments on a range of datasets, including image data (handwritten digits, medical images, and climate data) and financial time series for stress testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reduce-Rank Matrix Integer-Valued Autoregressive Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03338v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integer-valued time series are widely present in many fields, such as finance, economics, disease transmission, and traffic flow. With data dimensions surging, the traditional multivariate generalized integer autoregressive (MGINAR) model faces parameter overload, poor interpretability, and structural information loss. Matrix integer-valued autoregression (MINAR) model captures row-column cross-correlations and reduces the number of parameters to be estimated. However, further growth in dimensionality causes data redundancy, which degrades the MINAR model's performance and increases the number of parameters. To solve the limitations of the MINAR model described above, this paper proposes the reduced-rank matrix integer-valued autoregression (RRMINAR) model. Reducing rank is achieved by adding low-rank constraints to the coefficient matrices in the MINAR model, leading to RRMINAR reducing parameter quantity while incorporating matrix structure information. We develop an iterative conditional least squares estimation and analyze its asymptotic properties. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RRMINAR model exhibits more robust parameter estimation and higher prediction accuracy than MGINAR and MINAR models when the data structure is low-rank. Empirical analysis using criminal data validates the proposed RRMINAR model's effectiveness and uncovers structural temporal-spatial information in criminal behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[MillGNN: Learning Multi-Scale Lead-Lag Dependencies for Multi-Variate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03852v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-variate time series (MTS) forecasting is crucial for various applications. Existing methods have shown promising results owing to their strong ability to capture intra- and inter-variate dependencies. However, these methods often overlook lead-lag dependencies at multiple grouping scales, failing to capture hierarchical lead-lag effects in complex systems. To this end, we propose MillGNN, a novel \underline{g}raph \underline{n}eural \underline{n}etwork-based method that learns \underline{m}ult\underline{i}ple grouping scale \underline{l}ead-\underline{l}ag dependencies for MTS forecasting, which can comprehensively capture lead-lag effects considering variate-wise and group-wise dynamics and decays. Specifically, MillGNN introduces two key innovations: (1) a scale-specific lead-lag graph learning module that integrates cross-correlation coefficients and dynamic decaying features derived from real-time inputs and time lags to learn lead-lag dependencies for each scale, which can model evolving lead-lag dependencies with statistical interpretability and data-driven flexibility; (2) a hierarchical lead-lag message passing module that passes lead-lag messages at multiple grouping scales in a structured way to simultaneously propagate intra- and inter-scale lead-lag effects, which can capture multi-scale lead-lag effects with a balance of comprehensiveness and efficiency. Experimental results on 11 datasets demonstrate the superiority of MillGNN for long-term and short-term MTS forecasting, compared with 16 state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Online time series prediction using feature adjustment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03810v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is of significant importance across various domains. However, it faces significant challenges due to distribution shift. This issue becomes particularly pronounced in online deployment scenarios where data arrives sequentially, requiring models to adapt continually to evolving patterns. Current time series online learning methods focus on two main aspects: selecting suitable parameters to update (e.g., final layer weights or adapter modules) and devising suitable update strategies (e.g., using recent batches, replay buffers, or averaged gradients). We challenge the conventional parameter selection approach, proposing that distribution shifts stem from changes in underlying latent factors influencing the data. Consequently, updating the feature representations of these latent factors may be more effective. To address the critical problem of delayed feedback in multi-step forecasting (where true values arrive much later than predictions), we introduce ADAPT-Z (Automatic Delta Adjustment via Persistent Tracking in Z-space). ADAPT-Z utilizes an adapter module that leverages current feature representations combined with historical gradient information to enable robust parameter updates despite the delay. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms standard base models without adaptation and surpasses state-of-the-art online learning approaches across multiple datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/xiannanhuang/ADAPT-Z.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long Input Sequence Network for Long Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15869v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Short fixed-length inputs are the main bottleneck of deep learning methods in long time-series forecasting tasks. Prolonging input length causes overfitting, rapidly deteriorating accuracy. Our research indicates that the overfitting is a combination reaction of the multi-scale pattern coupling in time series and the fixed focusing scale of current models. First, we find that the patterns exhibited by a time series across various scales are reflective of its multi-periodic nature, where each scale corresponds to specific period length. Second, We find that the token size predominantly dictates model behavior, as it determines the scale at which the model focuses and the context size it can accommodate. Our idea is to decouple the multi-scale temporal patterns of time series and to model each pattern with its corresponding period length as token size. We introduced a novel series-decomposition module(MPSD), and a Multi-Token Pattern Recognition neural network(MTPR), enabling the model to handle \textit{inputs up to $10\times$ longer}. Sufficient context enhances performance(\textit{38% maximum precision improvement}), and the decoupling approach offers \textit{Low complexity($0.22\times$ cost)} and \textit{high interpretability}.</p></details> | <details><summary>rewri...</summary><p>rewrite and authorship changing</p></details> |
| **[Breaking the Context Bottleneck on Long Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16572v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time-series forecasting is essential for planning and decision-making in economics, energy, and transportation, where long foresight is required. To obtain such long foresight, models must be both efficient and effective in processing long sequence. Recent advancements have enhanced the efficiency of these models; however, the challenge of effectively leveraging longer sequences persists. This is primarily due to the tendency of these models to overfit when presented with extended inputs, necessitating the use of shorter input lengths to maintain tolerable error margins. In this work, we investigate the multiscale modeling method and propose the Logsparse Decomposable Multiscaling (LDM) framework for the efficient and effective processing of long sequences. We demonstrate that by decoupling patterns at different scales in time series, we can enhance predictability by reducing non-stationarity, improve efficiency through a compact long input representation, and simplify the architecture by providing clear task assignments. Experimental results demonstrate that LDM not only outperforms all baselines in long-term forecasting benchmarks, but also reducing both training time and memory costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>rewri...</summary><p>rewrite and authorship changing</p></details> |
| **[TimeCopilot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00616v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce TimeCopilot, the first open-source agentic framework for forecasting that combines multiple Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) through a single unified API. TimeCopilot automates the forecasting pipeline: feature analysis, model selection, cross-validation, and forecast generation, while providing natural language explanations and supporting direct queries about the future. The framework is LLM-agnostic, compatible with both commercial and open-source models, and supports ensembles across diverse forecasting families. Results on the large-scale GIFT-Eval benchmark show that TimeCopilot achieves state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting performance at low cost. Our framework provides a practical foundation for reproducible, explainable, and accessible agentic forecasting systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimation of High-Dimensional Markov-Switching VAR Models with an Approximate EM Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07456v3)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regime shifts in high-dimensional time series arise naturally in many applications, from neuroimaging to finance. This problem has received considerable attention in low-dimensional settings, with both Bayesian and frequentist methods used extensively for parameter estimation. The EM algorithm is a particularly popular strategy for parameter estimation in low-dimensional settings, although the statistical properties of the resulting estimates have not been well understood. Furthermore, its extension to high-dimensional time series has proved challenging. To overcome these challenges, in this paper we propose an approximate EM algorithm for Markov-switching VAR models that leads to efficient computation and also facilitates the investigation of asymptotic properties of the resulting parameter estimates. We establish the consistency of the proposed EM algorithm in high dimensions and investigate its performance via simulation studies. We also demonstrate the algorithm by analyzing a brain electroencephalography (EEG) dataset recorded on a patient experiencing epileptic seizure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sampling parameters of ordinary differential equations with Langevin dynamics that satisfy constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15505v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fitting models to data to obtain distributions of consistent parameter values is important for uncertainty quantification, model comparison, and prediction. Standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches for fitting ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to time-series data involve proposing trial parameter sets, numerically integrating the ODEs forward in time, and accepting or rejecting the trial parameter sets. When the model dynamics depend nonlinearly on the parameters, as is generally the case, trial parameter sets are often rejected, and MCMC approaches become prohibitively computationally costly to converge. Here, we build on methods for numerical continuation and trajectory optimization to introduce an approach in which we use Langevin dynamics in the joint space of variables and parameters to sample models that satisfy constraints on the dynamics. We demonstrate the method by sampling Hopf bifurcations and limit cycles of a model of a biochemical oscillator in a Bayesian framework for parameter estimation, and we attain performance that matches or exceeds the performance of leading MCMC approaches that require numerically integrating the ODEs forward in time. We describe numerical experiments that provide insight into the speedup. The method is general and can be used in any framework for parameter estimation and model selection.</p></details> | 32 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Seasonal and periodic patterns of ischemic heart disease in New York using the Variable Multiple Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03710v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Seasonal patterns of the incidence, hospital visits, and mortality of ischemic heart disease (IHD) have been widely reported. This study aims to investigate seasonal and periodic patterns of IHD hospitalizations in New York using a novel bootstrap approach, the Variable Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap (VBPBB) method. Using a bandpass filter, VBPBB isolates the periodically correlated (PC) component of interest from other PC components and noise before bootstrapping, preserving correlation structures and yielding more precise 95\% confidence intervals than existing periodic bootstrapping methods. We examine weekly, monthly, and annual patterns, along with their harmonic frequencies, in the IHD hospitalization. In addition to the pre-defined frequencies, we also examine the frequencies with the highest amplitudes in the periodogram. By aggregating bootstrap results from statistically significant PC components, a 95\% CI band that preserves multiple periodic correlation structures was obtained. Statistically significant variation was observed for the weekly, annual component, and its 2nd, 3rd, 5th, and 6th harmonics. CI bands obtained from VBPBB were much narrower than those from existing periodic bootstrapping methods. VBPBB substantially improves the precision of periodic mean estimates while preserving periodic correlation structures, making it suitable for time series with multiple periodic patterns and high noise, such as in environmental or healthcare data.</p></details> |  |

Using deep reinforcement learning and time-series forecasting models, we optimize microgrid energy dispatch strategies to minimize costs and maximize the utilization of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. Our approach integrates the transformer architecture for forecasting of renewable generation and a proximal-policy optimization (PPO) agent to make decisions in a simulated environment. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both energy efficiency and operational resilience when compared to traditional rule-based methods. This work contributes to advancing smart-grid technologies in pursuit of zero-carbon energy systems. We finally provide an open-source framework for simulating several microgrid environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE (International Conference on Smart Energy Grid Engineering (SEGE)) 2025, 6 pages</p></details> |
| **[Semi-decentralized Federated Time Series Prediction with Client Availability Budgets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03660v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) effectively promotes collaborative training among distributed clients with privacy considerations in the Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. Despite of data heterogeneity, FL clients may also be constrained by limited energy and availability budgets. Therefore, effective selection of clients participating in training is of vital importance for the convergence of the global model and the balance of client contributions. In this paper, we discuss the performance impact of client availability with time-series data on federated learning. We set up three different scenarios that affect the availability of time-series data and propose FedDeCAB, a novel, semi-decentralized client selection method applying probabilistic rankings of available clients. When a client is disconnected from the server, FedDeCAB allows obtaining partial model parameters from the nearest neighbor clients for joint optimization, improving the performance of offline models and reducing communication overhead. Experiments based on real-world large-scale taxi and vessel trajectory datasets show that FedDeCAB is effective under highly heterogeneous data distribution, limited communication budget, and dynamic client offline or rejoining.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Evaluation of Factors Affecting SHAP Explanation of Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03649v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainable AI (XAI) has become an increasingly important topic for understanding and attributing the predictions made by complex Time Series Classification (TSC) models. Among attribution methods, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is widely regarded as an excellent attribution method; but its computational complexity, which scales exponentially with the number of features, limits its practicality for long time series. To address this, recent studies have shown that aggregating features via segmentation, to compute a single attribution value for a group of consecutive time points, drastically reduces SHAP running time. However, the choice of the optimal segmentation strategy remains an open question. In this work, we investigated eight different Time Series Segmentation algorithms to understand how segment compositions affect the explanation quality. We evaluate these approaches using two established XAI evaluation methodologies: InterpretTime and AUC Difference. Through experiments on both Multivariate (MTS) and Univariate Time Series (UTS), we find that the number of segments has a greater impact on explanation quality than the specific segmentation method. Notably, equal-length segmentation consistently outperforms most of the custom time series segmentation algorithms. Furthermore, we introduce a novel attribution normalisation technique that weights segments by their length and we show that it consistently improves attribution quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structure-preserving contrastive learning for spatial time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06380v4)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of neural network models largely relies on learning meaningful latent patterns from data, where self-supervised learning of informative representations can enhance model performance and generalisability. However, self-supervised representation learning for spatially characterised time series, which are ubiquitous in transportation domain, poses unique challenges due to the necessity of maintaining fine-grained spatio-temporal similarities in the latent space. In this study, we introduce two structure-preserving regularisers for the contrastive learning of spatial time series: one regulariser preserves the topology of similarities between instances, and the other preserves the graph geometry of similarities across spatial and temporal dimensions. To balance the contrastive learning objective and the need for structure preservation, we propose a dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively manages this trade-off and stabilises training. We validate the proposed method through extensive experiments, including multivariate time series classification to demonstrate its general applicability, as well as macroscopic and microscopic traffic prediction to highlight its particular usefulness in encoding traffic interactions. Across all tasks, our method preserves the similarity structures more effectively and improves state-of-the-art task performances. This method can be integrated with an arbitrary neural network model and is particularly beneficial for time series data with spatial or geographical features. Furthermore, our findings suggest that well-preserved similarity structures in the latent space indicate more informative and useful representations. This provides insights to design more effective neural networks for data-driven transportation research. Our code is made openly accessible with all resulting data at https://github.com/yiru-jiao/spclt</p></details> | <details><summary>TL;DR...</summary><p>TL;DR: Preserving certain structures of similarity relations in spatio-temporal data can improve downstream task performance via contrastive learning</p></details> |
| **[Temporal social network modeling of mobile connectivity data with graph neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03319v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art data-driven tool for modeling connectivity data of graph-structured complex networks and integrating information of their nodes and edges in space and time. However, as of yet, the analysis of social networks using the time series of people's mobile connectivity data has not been extensively investigated. In the present study, we investigate four snapshot - based temporal GNNs in predicting the phone call and SMS activity between users of a mobile communication network. In addition, we develop a simple non - GNN baseline model using recently proposed EdgeBank method. Our analysis shows that the ROLAND temporal GNN outperforms the baseline model in most cases, whereas the other three GNNs perform on average worse than the baseline. The results show that GNN based approaches hold promise in the analysis of temporal social networks through mobile connectivity data. However, due to the relatively small performance margin between ROLAND and the baseline model, further research is required on specialized GNN architectures for temporal social network analysis.</p></details> | 22 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Evaluation of Stress Detection as Time Series Events -- A Novel Window-Based F1-Metric](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03240v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate evaluation of event detection in time series is essential for applications such as stress monitoring with wearable devices, where ground truth is typically annotated as single-point events, even though the underlying phenomena are gradual and temporally diffused. Standard metrics like F1 and point-adjusted F1 (F1$_{pa}$) often misrepresent model performance in such real-world, imbalanced datasets. We introduce a window-based F1 metric (F1$_w$) that incorporates temporal tolerance, enabling a more robust assessment of event detection when exact alignment is unrealistic. Empirical analysis in three physiological datasets, two in-the-wild (ADARP, Wrist Angel) and one experimental (ROAD), indicates that F1$_w$ reveals meaningful model performance patterns invisible to conventional metrics, while its window size can be adapted to domain knowledge to avoid overestimation. We show that the choice of evaluation metric strongly influences the interpretation of model performance: using predictions from TimesFM, only our temporally tolerant metrics reveal statistically significant improvements over random and null baselines in the two in-the-wild use cases. This work addresses key gaps in time series evaluation and provides practical guidance for healthcare applications where requirements for temporal precision vary by context.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Optimizing Federated Learning for Scalable Power-demand Forecasting in Microgrids](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08022v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time monitoring of power consumption in cities and micro-grids through the Internet of Things (IoT) can help forecast future demand and optimize grid operations. But moving all consumer-level usage data to the cloud for predictions and analysis at fine time scales can expose activity patterns. Federated Learning~(FL) is a privacy-sensitive collaborative DNN training approach that retains data on edge devices, trains the models on private data locally, and aggregates the local models in the cloud. But key challenges exist: (i) clients can have non-independently identically distributed~(non-IID) data, and (ii) the learning should be computationally cheap while scaling to 1000s of (unseen) clients. In this paper, we develop and evaluate several optimizations to FL training across edge and cloud for time-series demand forecasting in micro-grids and city-scale utilities using DNNs to achieve a high prediction accuracy while minimizing the training cost. We showcase the benefit of using exponentially weighted loss while training and show that it further improves the prediction of the final model. Finally, we evaluate these strategies by validating over 1000s of clients for three states in the US from the OpenEIA corpus, and performing FL both in a pseudo-distributed setting and a Pi edge cluster. The results highlight the benefits of the proposed methods over baselines like ARIMA and DNNs trained for individual consumers, which are not scalable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information transmission: Inferring change area from change moment in time series remote sensing images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03112v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series change detection is a critical task for exploring ecosystem dynamics using time series remote sensing images, because it can simultaneously indicate where and when change occur. While deep learning has shown excellent performance in this domain, it continues to approach change area detection and change moment identification as distinct tasks. Given that change area can be inferred from change moment, we propose a time series change detection network, named CAIM-Net (Change Area Inference from Moment Network), to ensure consistency between change area and change moment results. CAIM-Net infers change area from change moment based on the intrinsic relationship between time series analysis and spatial change detection. The CAIM-Net comprises three key steps: Difference Extraction and Enhancement, Coarse Change Moment Extraction, and Fine Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference. In the Difference Extraction and Enhancement, a lightweight encoder with batch dimension stacking is designed to rapidly extract difference features. Subsequently, boundary enhancement convolution is applied to amplify these difference features. In the Coarse Change Moment Extraction, the enhanced difference features from the first step are used to spatiotemporal correlation analysis, and then two distinct methods are employed to determine coarse change moments. In the Fine Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference, a multiscale temporal Class Activation Mapping (CAM) module first increases the weight of the change-occurring moment from coarse change moments. Then the weighted change moment is used to infer change area based on the fact that pixels with the change moment must have undergone a change.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating a Model-Agnostic and Imputation-Free Approach for Irregularly-Sampled Multivariate Time-Series Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15785v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling Irregularly-sampled and Multivariate Time Series (IMTS) is crucial across a variety of applications where different sets of variates may be missing at different time-steps due to sensor malfunctions or high data acquisition costs. Existing approaches for IMTS either consider a two-stage impute-then-model framework or involve specialized architectures specific to a particular model and task. We perform a series of experiments to derive novel insights about the performance of IMTS methods on a variety of semi-synthetic and real-world datasets for both classification and forecasting. We also introduce Missing Feature-aware Time Series Modeling (MissTSM) or MissTSM, a novel model-agnostic and imputation-free approach for IMTS modeling. We show that MissTSM shows competitive performance compared to other IMTS approaches, especially when the amount of missing values is large and the data lacks simplistic periodic structures - conditions common to real-world IMTS applications.</p></details> | 21 pages |

To address this challenge, Fourier neural networks (FNNs) and similar approaches integrate components of Fourier series into the structure of neural networks. Nonetheless, a significant hurdle is often overlooked: the superposition of periodic signals does not necessarily result in a periodic signal. For example, when forecasting almost periodic functions composed of signals with incommensurate frequencies, traditional models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) frequently outperform most neural networks including large language models (LLMs). To tackle this goal, we propose Autoregressive-Weight-Enhanced AR-KAN, a hybrid model that combines the benefits of both methods. Using the Universal Myopic Mapping Theorem, we apply a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for the static nonlinear part and include memory through a pre-trained AR component, which can be explained to retain the most useful information while eliminating redundancy. Experimental data indicates that AR-KAN delivers superior results on $72\%$ of real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Decision-Making Strategy Considering User Satisfaction Feedback in Demand Response Program](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02946v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Demand response providers (DRPs) are intermediaries between the upper-level distribution system operator and the lower-level participants in demand response (DR) programs. Usually, DRPs act as leaders and determine electricity pricing strategies to maximize their economic revenue, while end-users adjust their power consumption following the pricing signals. However, this profit-seeking bi-level optimization model often neglects the satisfaction of end-users participating in DR programs. In addition, the detailed mathematical models underlying user decision-making strategy and satisfaction evaluation mechanism are typically unavailable to DRPs, posing significant challenges to conventional model-based solution methods. To address these issues, this paper designs a user-side satisfaction evaluation mechanism and proposes a multi-branch temporal fusion twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (MBTF-TD3) reinforcement learning algorithm. User satisfaction feedback is incorporated into the reward function via a dynamically adjusted penalty term. The proposed MBTF structure effectively extracts temporal feature dependencies in the time-series observation data, and the dynamically adjusted penalty function successfully enhances the overall satisfaction level of users. Several experiments are conducted to validate the performance and the effectiveness of our proposed solution algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version corrects equation display errors that occurred in the IEEE Xplore version.

| **[Recursive Gaussian Process State Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14679v3)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning dynamical models from data is not only fundamental but also holds great promise for advancing principle discovery, time-series prediction, and controller design. Among various approaches, Gaussian Process State-Space Models (GPSSMs) have recently gained significant attention due to their combination of flexibility and interpretability. However, for online learning, the field lacks an efficient method suitable for scenarios where prior information regarding data distribution and model function is limited. To address this issue, this paper proposes a recursive GPSSM method with adaptive capabilities for both operating domains and Gaussian process (GP) hyperparameters. Specifically, we first utilize first-order linearization to derive a Bayesian update equation for the joint distribution between the system state and the GP model, enabling closed-form and domain-independent learning. Second, an online selection algorithm for inducing points is developed based on informative criteria to achieve lightweight learning. Third, to support online hyperparameter optimization, we recover historical measurement information from the current filtering distribution. Comprehensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior accuracy, computational efficiency, and adaptability of our method compared to state-of-the-art online GPSSM techniques.</p></details> |  |

This study employs machine learning to analyze genomic and epidemiological data from the public databases for molecular typing and microbial genome diversity (PubMLST), incorporating data from UK government-supported AMR surveillance by the Food Standards Agency and Food Standards Scotland. We identify AMR patterns in Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli isolates collected in the UK from 2001 to 2017. The research integrates whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, epidemiological metadata, and economic projections to identify key resistance determinants and forecast future resistance trends and healthcare costs. We investigate gyrA mutations for fluoroquinolone resistance and the tet(O) gene for tetracycline resistance, training a Random Forest model validated with bootstrap resampling (1,000 samples, 95% confidence intervals), achieving 74% accuracy in predicting AMR phenotypes. Time-series forecasting models (SARIMA, SIR, and Prophet) predict a rise in campylobacteriosis cases, potentially exceeding 130 cases per 100,000 people by 2050, with an economic burden projected to surpass 1.9 billion GBP annually if left unchecked. An enhanced Random Forest system, analyzing 6,683 isolates, refines predictions by incorporating temporal patterns, uncertainty estimation, and resistance trend modeling, indicating sustained high beta-lactam resistance, increasing fluoroquinolone resistance, and fluctuating tetracycline resistance.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 1 table.

However, current methods struggle to handle time series data with change points - sudden shifts in the underlying data-generating process. In this paper, we propose a novel Conformal Prediction for Time-series with Change points (CPTC) algorithm, addressing this gap by integrating a model to predict the underlying state with online conformal prediction to model uncertainties in non-stationary time series. We prove CPTC's validity and improved adaptivity in the time series setting under minimum assumptions, and demonstrate CPTC's practical effectiveness on 6 synthetic and real-world datasets, showing improved validity and adaptivity compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Temporal Knowledge-Base Creation for Fine-Grained Opinion Analysis with Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02363v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a scalable method for constructing a temporal opinion knowledge base with large language models (LLMs) as automated annotators. Despite the demonstrated utility of time-series opinion analysis of text for downstream applications such as forecasting and trend analysis, existing methodologies underexploit this potential due to the absence of temporally grounded fine-grained annotations. Our approach addresses this gap by integrating well-established opinion mining formulations into a declarative LLM annotation pipeline, enabling structured opinion extraction without manual prompt engineering. We define three data models grounded in sentiment and opinion mining literature, serving as schemas for structured representation. We perform rigorous quantitative evaluation of our pipeline using human-annotated test samples. We carry out the final annotations using two separate LLMs, and inter-annotator agreement is computed label-wise across the fine-grained opinion dimensions, analogous to human annotation protocols. The resulting knowledge base encapsulates time-aligned, structured opinions and is compatible with applications in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), temporal question answering, and timeline summarisation.</p></details> |  |
| **[RDIT: Residual-based Diffusion Implicit Models for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02341v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (PTSF) plays a critical role in domains requiring accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions for decision-making. However, existing methods offer suboptimal distribution modeling and suffer from a mismatch between training and evaluation metrics. Surprisingly, we found that augmenting a strong point estimator with a zero-mean Gaussian, whose standard deviation matches its training error, can yield state-of-the-art performance in PTSF. In this work, we propose RDIT, a plug-and-play framework that combines point estimation and residual-based conditional diffusion with a bidirectional Mamba network. We theoretically prove that the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) can be minimized by adjusting to an optimal standard deviation and then derive algorithms to achieve distribution matching. Evaluations on eight multivariate datasets across varied forecasting horizons demonstrate that RDIT achieves lower CRPS, rapid inference, and improved coverage compared to strong baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Diffusion Models for Generative Forecasting of Financial Charts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02308v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative models have enabled significant progress in tasks such as generating and editing images from text, as well as creating videos from text prompts, and these methods are being applied across various fields. However, in the financial domain, there may still be a reliance on time-series data and a continued focus on transformer models, rather than on diverse applications of generative models. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages text-to-image model by treating time-series data as a single image pattern, thereby enabling the prediction of stock price trends. Unlike prior methods that focus on learning and classifying chart patterns using architectures such as ResNet or ViT, we experiment with generating the next chart image from the current chart image and an instruction prompt using diffusion models. Furthermore, we introduce a simple method for evaluating the generated chart image against ground truth image. We highlight the potential of leveraging text-to-image generative models in the financial domain, and our findings motivate further research to address the current limitations and expand their applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[End to End Autoencoder MLP Framework for Sepsis Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18688v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sepsis is a life threatening condition that requires timely detection in intensive care settings. Traditional machine learning approaches, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost, often rely on manual feature engineering and struggle with irregular, incomplete time-series data commonly present in electronic health records. We introduce an end-to-end deep learning framework integrating an unsupervised autoencoder for automatic feature extraction with a multilayer perceptron classifier for binary sepsis risk prediction. To enhance clinical applicability, we implement a customized down sampling strategy that extracts high information density segments during training and a non-overlapping dynamic sliding window mechanism for real-time inference. Preprocessed time series data are represented as fixed dimension vectors with explicit missingness indicators, mitigating bias and noise. We validate our approach on three ICU cohorts. Our end-to-end model achieves accuracies of 74.6 percent, 80.6 percent, and 93.5 percent, respectively, consistently outperforming traditional machine learning baselines. These results demonstrate the framework's superior robustness, generalizability, and clinical utility for early sepsis detection across heterogeneous ICU environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[ST-Hyper: Learning High-Order Dependencies Across Multiple Spatial-Temporal Scales for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02217v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting, many deep learning based methods have been proposed for modeling dependencies at multiple spatial (inter-variate) or temporal (intra-variate) scales. However, existing methods may fail to model dependencies across multiple spatial-temporal scales (ST-scales, i.e., scales that jointly consider spatial and temporal scopes). In this work, we propose ST-Hyper to model the high-order dependencies across multiple ST-scales through adaptive hypergraph modeling. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial-Temporal Pyramid Modeling (STPM) module to extract features at multiple ST-scales. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Hypergraph Modeling (AHM) module that learns a sparse hypergraph to capture robust high-order dependencies among features. In addition, we interact with these features through tri-phase hypergraph propagation, which can comprehensively capture multi-scale spatial-temporal dynamics. Experimental results on six real-world MTS datasets demonstrate that ST-Hyper achieves the state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best baselines with an average MAE reduction of 3.8\% and 6.8\% for long-term and short-term forecasting, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |

Candidate PMU locations are ranked via a cross-validated Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, and each selection is refined through local neighborhood exploration to produce a near-optimal sensor set. The resulting PMU subset is then supplied to a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for faulted-line localization and fault-type classification from time-series measurements. Evaluation on modified IEEE 34- and IEEE 123-bus systems demonstrates that the proposed FSNR-SVM method identifies a minimal PMU configuration that achieves the best overall CNN performance, attaining over 96 percent accuracy in fault location and over 99 percent accuracy in fault-type classification on the IEEE 34 system, and approximately 94 percent accuracy in fault location and around 99.8 percent accuracy in fault-type classification on the IEEE 123 system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper submitted to 57th North American Power Symposium (NAPS) 2025</p></details> |

Future order distribution information, which reflects the distribution of orders in on-demand food delivery, is crucial for the performance of logistical demand-supply forecasting. Current studies utilize spatial-temporal analysis methods to model future order distribution information from serious time slices. However, learning future order distribution in online delivery platform is a time-series-insensitive problem with strong randomness. These approaches often struggle to effectively capture this information while remaining efficient. This paper proposes an innovative spatiotemporal learning model that utilizes only two graphs (ongoing and global) to learn future order distribution information, achieving superior performance compared to traditional spatial-temporal long-series methods. The main contributions are as follows: (1) The introduction of ongoing and global graphs in logistical demand-supply pressure forecasting compared to traditional long time series significantly enhances forecasting performance. (2) An innovative graph learning network framework using adaptive future graph learning and innovative cross attention mechanism (ACA-Net) is proposed to extract future order distribution information, effectively learning a robust future graph that substantially improves logistical demand-supply pressure forecasting outcomes. (3) The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated in real-world production environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, DASFAA2025 conference full paper</p></details> |

Eye Tracking-Based Modeling of Situational Awareness in Augmented Reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05025v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Augmented Reality (AR) systems, while enhancing task performance through real-time guidance, pose risks of inducing cognitive tunneling-a hyperfocus on virtual content that compromises situational awareness (SA) in safety-critical scenarios. This paper investigates SA in AR-guided cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), where responders must balance effective compressions with vigilance to unpredictable hazards (e.g., patient vomiting). We developed an AR app on a Magic Leap 2 that overlays real-time CPR feedback (compression depth and rate) and conducted a user study with simulated unexpected incidents (e.g., bleeding) to evaluate SA, in which SA metrics were collected via observation and questionnaires administered during freeze-probe events. Eye tracking analysis revealed that higher SA levels were associated with greater saccadic amplitude and velocity, and with reduced proportion and frequency of fixations on virtual content. To predict SA, we propose FixGraphPool, a graph neural network that structures gaze events (fixations, saccades) into spatiotemporal graphs, effectively capturing dynamic attentional patterns. Our model achieved 83.0% accuracy (F1=81.0%), outperforming feature-based machine learning and state-of-the-art time-series models by leveraging domain knowledge and spatial-temporal information encoded in ET data. These findings demonstrate the potential of eye tracking for SA modeling in AR and highlight its utility in designing AR systems that ensure user safety and situational awareness.</p></details> |  |
| **[When LLM Meets Time Series: Can LLMs Perform Multi-Step Time Series Reasoning and Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01822v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked growing interest in their application to time series analysis tasks. However, their ability to perform complex reasoning over temporal data in real-world application domains remains underexplored. To move toward this goal, a first step is to establish a rigorous benchmark dataset for evaluation. In this work, we introduce the TSAIA Benchmark, a first attempt to evaluate LLMs as time-series AI assistants. To ensure both scientific rigor and practical relevance, we surveyed over 20 academic publications and identified 33 real-world task formulations. The benchmark encompasses a broad spectrum of challenges, ranging from constraint-aware forecasting to anomaly detection with threshold calibration: tasks that require compositional reasoning and multi-step time series analysis. The question generator is designed to be dynamic and extensible, supporting continuous expansion as new datasets or task types are introduced. Given the heterogeneous nature of the tasks, we adopt task-specific success criteria and tailored inference-quality metrics to ensure meaningful evaluation for each task. We apply this benchmark to assess eight state-of-the-art LLMs under a unified evaluation protocol. Our analysis reveals limitations in current models' ability to assemble complex time series analysis workflows, underscoring the need for specialized methodologies for domain-specific adaptation. Our benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Melady/TSAIA, and the code is available at https://github.com/USC-Melady/TSAIA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Monitoring Time Series for Relevant Changes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01756v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of sequentially testing for changes in the mean parameter of a time series, compared to a benchmark period. Most tests in the literature focus on the null hypothesis of a constant mean versus the alternative of a single change at an unknown time. Yet in many applications it is unrealistic that no change occurs at all, or that after one change the time series remains stationary forever. We introduce a new setup, modeling the sequence of means as a piecewise constant function with arbitrarily many changes. Instead of testing for a change, we ask whether the evolving sequence of means, say $(\mu_n)_{n \geq 1}$, stays within a narrow corridor around its initial value, that is, $\mu_n \in [\mu_1-\Delta, \mu_1+\Delta]$ for all $n \ge 1$. Combining elements from multiple change point detection with a H\"older-type monitoring procedure, we develop a new online monitoring tool. A key challenge in both construction and proof of validity is that the risk of committing a type-I error after any time $n$ fundamentally depends on the unknown future of the time series. Simulations support our theoretical results and we present two real-world applications: (1) healthcare monitoring, with a focus on blood glucose tracking, and (2) political consensus analysis via citizen opinion polls.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Attacks and Defenses in Multivariate Time-Series Forecasting for Smart and Connected Infrastructures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14875v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of deep learning models has revolutionized various industries over the last decade, leading to a surge in connected devices and infrastructures. However, these models can be tricked into making incorrect predictions with high confidence, leading to disastrous failures and security concerns. To this end, we explore the impact of adversarial attacks on multivariate time-series forecasting and investigate methods to counter them. Specifically, we employ untargeted white-box attacks, namely the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and the Basic Iterative Method (BIM), to poison the inputs to the training process, effectively misleading the model. We also illustrate the subtle modifications to the inputs after the attack, which makes detecting the attack using the naked eye quite difficult. Having demonstrated the feasibility of these attacks, we develop robust models through adversarial training and model hardening. We are among the first to showcase the transferability of these attacks and defenses by extrapolating our work from the benchmark electricity data to a larger, 10-year real-world data used for predicting the time-to-failure of hard disks. Our experimental results confirm that the attacks and defenses achieve the desired security thresholds, leading to a 72.41% and 94.81% decrease in RMSE for the electricity and hard disk datasets respectively after implementing the adversarial defenses.</p></details> | 18 pages, 34 figures |
| **[Multilevel functional distributional models with application to continuous glucose monitoring in diabetes clinical trials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10514v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is a minimally invasive technology that measures blood glucose every few minutes for weeks or months at a time. CGM data are often collected in the free-living environment and is strongly related to sleep, physical activity and meal intake. As the timing of these activities varies substantially within- and between-individuals, it is difficult to model CGM trajectories as a function of time of day. Therefore, in practice, CGM trajectories are often reduced to one or two scalar summaries of the thousands of measurements collected for a study participant. To alleviate the potential loss of information, the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the CGM time series was proposed as an alternative. Here we address the problem of conducting inference on cdfs in clinical trials with long follow up and frequent measurements. Our approach provides three major innovations: (1) modeling the entire cdf and preserving its monotonicity; (2) accounting for the cdfs correlation (because they are measured on the same individual), continuity (results are robust to the choice of the probability grid), and differential error (e.g., medians have lower variability than $0.99$ quantiles); and (3) preserving the family-wise error when the observed data are longitudinal samples of cdfs. We focus on modeling data collected by The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation Continuous Glucose Monitoring Group in a large clinical trial that collected CGM data every few minutes for 26 weeks. Our basic observation unit is the distribution of CGM observations in a four-week interval. The scientific goals are to: (1) identify and quantify the effects of factors that affect glycaemic control in type 1 diabetes patients (T1D); and (2) identify and characterize the patients who respond to treatment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-driven Discovery of Digital Twins in Biomedical Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21484v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent technological advances have expanded the availability of high-throughput biological datasets, enabling the reliable design of digital twins of biomedical systems or patients. Such computational tools represent key reaction networks driving perturbation or drug response and can guide drug discovery and personalized therapeutics. Yet, their development still relies on laborious data integration by the human modeler, so that automated approaches are critically needed. The success of data-driven system discovery in Physics, rooted in clean datasets and well-defined governing laws, has fueled interest in applying similar techniques in Biology, which presents unique challenges. Here, we reviewed methodologies for automatically inferring digital twins from biological time series, which mostly involve symbolic or sparse regression. We evaluate algorithms according to eight biological and methodological challenges, associated to noisy/incomplete data, multiple conditions, prior knowledge integration, latent variables, high dimensionality, unobserved variable derivatives, candidate library design, and uncertainty quantification. Upon these criteria, sparse regression generally outperformed symbolic regression, particularly when using Bayesian frameworks. We further highlight the emerging role of deep learning and large language models, which enable innovative prior knowledge integration, though the reliability and consistency of such approaches must be improved. While no single method addresses all challenges, we argue that progress in learning digital twins will come from hybrid and modular frameworks combining chemical reaction network-based mechanistic grounding, Bayesian uncertainty quantification, and the generative and knowledge integration capacities of deep learning. To support their development, we further propose a benchmarking framework to evaluate methods across all challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Time-Series Model for Areal Data Using Spatially Correlated Gaussian Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01604v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional spatio-temporal models for areal data typically begin with spatial structure imposed at the level of random effects and later extend to include temporal dynamics. We propose an alternative hierarchical modeling framework that captures temporal trends in areal data through Gaussian processes that share spatial information via correlated variance components. This allows the model to better capture shared patterns of variability across regions while preserving local temporal dynamics, offering a more flexible representation of spatio-temporal processes. Specifically, we extend independent Gaussian-process models for time-series data to a spatially correlated framework by placing a conditional autoregressive (CAR) prior on the parameters governing the temporal variability and imposing a conditional dependence of the temporal range on the temporal variance. We apply this model to two case studies: monthly malaria incidence in Niassa, Mozambique, and weekly food insecurity prevalence in Cameroon. Inference is conducted within a Bayesian framework using approximate posterior sampling. Given the hierarchical structure of the model, we employ a combination of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, including the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA), Metropolis-Hastings, and Gibbs sampling. In both applications, the model demonstrates strong in-sample performance with narrow credible intervals and outperforms established spatio-temporal approaches in many regions when forecasting. These results underscore the model's ability to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies while maintaining interpretability, key in settings with sparse data and policy relevance. By accounting for spatio-temporal variation through the evolution of temporal dynamics themselves, our approach offers a flexible and principled tool for many applied contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material included</p></details> |

DCM is designed for detecting many signals superimposed on an unknown trend. The solution for the non-linear DCM model is an ill-posed problem. The backbone of DCM is the Gauss-Markov theorem that the least squares fit is the best unbiased estimator for linear regression models. DCM is a simple numerical time series analysis method that performs a massive number of linear least squares fits. We show that our numerical solution for the DCM model fulfills the three conditions of a well-posed problem: existence, uniqueness and stability. The Fisher-test is used to identify the best DCM model from all alternative tested DCM models. The correct DCM model must also pass our Predictivity-test. Our analyses of seven different simulated data samples expose the weaknesses of DFT and the efficiency of DCM. The DCM signal and trend detection depend only on the sample size and the accuracy of data. DCM is an ideal forecasting method because the time span of observations is irrelevant. We recommend fast sampling of large high quality datasets and the analysis of those datasets using numerical DCM parallel computation Python code.</p></details> | 26 pages, 8 figures |

When deploying at the edge, we found the underutilization of frequency domain analysis in robotic manipulation trajectory prediction leads to neglecting the inherent rhythm information embedded within action sequences, resulting in errors at critical moments. To address this, we reframe imitation learning policies through the lens of time-scale domain and introduce the Wavelet Policy. This novel approach employs wavelet transforms (WT) and new Features Extractor (FE) for feature preprocessing and extracts multi-scale features using the Single Encoder to Multiple Decoder (SE2MD) architecture. Furthermore, to enhance feature mapping in the scale domain and appropriately increase model capacity, we introduce a Learnable Scale Domain Filter (LSDF) after each decoder, improving adaptability under different visual conditions. Our results show that the Wavelet Policy maintaining a comparable parameter count outperforms SOTA end-to-end methods on four challenging simulation robotic arm tasks and real tasks, especially at critical moments and remote settings simultaneously. We release the source code and model checkpoint of simulation task at https://github.com/lurenjia384/Wavelet_Policy.</p></details> |  |

Automatic detection of ICMEs in solar wind in situ data is essential for early warning systems. While several methods have been proposed to identify these structures in time series data, robust real-time detection remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present ARCANE - the first framework explicitly designed for early ICME detection in streaming solar wind data under realistic operational constraints, enabling event identification without requiring observation of the full structure. Our approach evaluates the strengths and limitations of detection models by comparing a machine learning-based method to a threshold-based baseline. The ResUNet++ model, previously validated on science data, significantly outperforms the baseline, particularly in detecting high-impact events, while retaining solid performance on lower-impact cases. Notably, we find that using real-time solar wind (RTSW) data instead of high-resolution science data leads to only minimal performance degradation. Despite the challenges of operational settings, our detection pipeline achieves an F1-Score of 0.37, with an average detection delay of 24.5% of the event's duration while processing only a minimal portion of the event data. As more data becomes available, the performance increases significantly. These results mark a substantial step forward in automated space weather monitoring and lay the groundwork for enhanced real-time forecasting capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 10 figures, 1 table, submitted to AGU Space Weather on 14th May 2025, revised 29th August 2025</p></details> |
| **[Bootstrap Diagnostic Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01351v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Violation of the assumptions underlying classical (Gaussian) limit theory frequently leads to unreliable statistical inference. This paper shows the novel result that the bootstrap can detect such violation by means of simple and powerful tests which (a) induce no pre-testing bias, (b) can be performed using the same critical values in a broad range of applications, and (c) are consistent against deviations from asymptotic normality. By focusing on the discrepancy between the conditional distribution of a bootstrap statistic and the (limiting) Gaussian distribution which obtains under valid specification, we show how to assess whether this discrepancy is large enough to indicate specification invalidity. The method, which is computationally straightforward, only requires to measure the discrepancy between the bootstrap and the Gaussian distributions based on a sample of i.i.d. draws of the bootstrap statistic. We derive sufficient conditions for the randomness in the data to mix with the randomness in the bootstrap repetitions in a way such that (a), (b) and (c) above hold. To demonstrate the practical relevance and broad applicability of our diagnostic procedure, we discuss five scenarios where the asymptotic Gaussian approximation may fail: (i) weak instruments in instrumental variable regression; (ii) non-stationarity in autoregressive time series; (iii) parameters near or at the boundary of the parameter space; (iv) infinite variance innovations in a location model for i.i.d. data; (v) invalidity of the delta method due to (near-)rank deficiency in the implied Jacobian matrix. An illustration drawn from the empirical macroeconomic literature concludes.</p></details> |  |

Despite its success, there is still potential to further improve its representational capacity and forecasting performance, particularly on challenging real-world datasets with unknown, intricate, and hierarchical dynamics. In this work, we propose a stochastic xLSTM, termed StoxLSTM, that improves the original architecture into a state space modeling framework by incorporating stochastic latent variables within xLSTM. StoxLSTM models the latent dynamic evolution through specially designed recurrent blocks, enabling it to effectively capture the underlying temporal patterns and dependencies. Extensive experiments on publicly available benchmark datasets from multiple research communities demonstrate that StoxLSTM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with better robustness and stronger generalization ability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Functional Time Series Forecasting of Distributions: A Koopman-Wasserstein Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07570v3)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel method for forecasting the temporal evolution of probability distributions observed at discrete time points. Extending the Dynamic Probability Density Decomposition (DPDD), we embed distributional dynamics into Wasserstein geometry via a Koopman operator framework. Our approach introduces an importance-weighted variant of Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD), enabling accurate, closed-form forecasts in 2-Wasserstein space. Theoretical guarantees are established: our estimator achieves spectral convergence and optimal finite-sample Wasserstein error. Simulation studies and a real-world application to U.S. housing price distributions show substantial improvements over existing methods such as Wasserstein Autoregression. By integrating optimal transport, functional time series modeling, and spectral operator theory, DPDD offers a scalable and interpretable solution for distributional forecasting. This work has broad implications for behavioral science, public health, finance, and neuroimaging--domains where evolving distributions arise naturally. Our framework contributes to functional data analysis on non-Euclidean spaces and provides a general tool for modeling and forecasting distributional time series.</p></details> | revised |

However, existing metrics suffer from several limitations: insufficient discriminative power, strong hyperparameter dependency, sensitivity to perturbations, and high computational overhead. This paper introduces Confidence-Consistency Evaluation (CCE), a novel evaluation metric that simultaneously measures prediction confidence and uncertainty consistency. By employing Bayesian estimation to quantify the uncertainty of anomaly scores, we construct both global and event-level confidence and consistency scores for model predictions, resulting in a concise CCE metric. Theoretically and experimentally, we demonstrate that CCE possesses strict boundedness, Lipschitz robustness against score perturbations, and linear time complexity $\mathcal{O}(n)$. Furthermore, we establish RankEval, a benchmark for comparing the ranking capabilities of various metrics. RankEval represents the first standardized and reproducible evaluation pipeline that enables objective comparison of evaluation metrics. Both CCE and RankEval implementations are fully open-source.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

In this work, we define optimal e-values for testing between maximum entropy models, both in the microcanonical (hard constraints) and canonical (soft constraints) settings. We show that, when testing between two hypotheses that are both microcanonical, the so-called growth-rate optimal e-variable admits an exact analytical expression, which also serves as a valid e-variable in the canonical case. For canonical tests, where exact solutions are typically unavailable, we introduce a microcanonical approximation and verify its excellent performance via both theoretical arguments and numerical simulations. We then consider constrained binary models, focusing on $2 \times k$ contingency tables -- an essential framework in statistics and a natural representation for various models of complex systems. Our microcanonical optimal e-variable performs well in both settings, constituting a new tool that remains effective even in the challenging case when the number $k$ of groups grows with the sample size, as in models with growing features used for the analysis of real-world heterogeneous networks and time-series.</p></details> |  |

The policy, publicly justified as a measure to curb misinformation and counter foreign influence, was abruptly rolled out on April 28, 2022. Using an interrupted time series design, we find no decline in participation by overseas users. Instead, it significantly reduced domestic engagement with local issues outside users' home provinces, particularly among critical comments. Evidence indicates this decline was not driven by generalized fear or concerns about credibility, but by a surge in regionally discriminatory replies that raised the social cost of cross-provincial engagement. Our findings suggest that identity disclosure tools can have unintended consequences by activating existing social divisions in ways that reinforce state control without direct censorship.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text: 8 pages, Supplement: 38 pages</p></details> |

Among these, two prominent classes are regularization-based defenses, which shape traffic using fixed padding rules, and supersequence-based approaches, which conceal traces among predefined patterns. In this work, we present a unified framework for designing an adaptive WF defense that combines the effectiveness of regularization with the provable security of supersequence-style grouping. The scheme first extracts behavioural patterns from traces and clusters them into (k,l)-diverse anonymity sets; an early-time-series classifier (adapted from ECDIRE) then switches from a conservative global set of regularization parameters to the lighter, set-specific parameters. We instantiate the design as Adaptive Tamaraw, a variant of Tamaraw that assigns padding parameters on a per-cluster basis while retaining its original information-theoretic guarantee. Comprehensive experiments on public real-world datasets confirm the benefits. By tuning k, operators can trade privacy for efficiency: in its high-privacy mode Adaptive Tamaraw pushes the bound on any attacker's accuracy below 30%, whereas in efficiency-centred settings it cuts total overhead by 99% compared with classic Tamaraw.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Kolmogorov Barrier: A Learnable Weighted Hybrid Autoencoder for Model Order Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18148v4)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning for high-dimensional, complex physical systems aims to identify a low-dimensional intrinsic latent space, which is crucial for reduced-order modeling and modal analysis. To overcome the well-known Kolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent years, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the latent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable weighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of singular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable weighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting parameters is essential -- without them, the resulting model would either collapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence behavior. Interestingly, we empirically find that our trained model has a sharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments on classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and forced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing methods. Additionally, when combining with time series modeling techniques (e.g., Koopman operator, LSTM), the proposed technique offers significant improvements for surrogate modeling of high-dimensional multi-scale PDE systems.</p></details> | 34 pages |

As financial transaction data streams grow in scale and complexity, traditional methods often require large labeled datasets, struggle with time series of irregular sampling frequencies and varying sequence lengths. To address these challenges, we extend conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for targeted data augmentation, integrate Bayesian inference to obtain predictive distributions and quantify uncertainty, and leverage log-signatures for robust feature encoding of transaction histories. We introduce a novel Wasserstein distance-based loss to align generated and real unlabeled samples while simultaneously maximizing classification accuracy on labeled data. Our approach is evaluated on the BankSim dataset, a widely used simulator for credit card transaction data, under varying proportions of labeled samples, demonstrating consistent improvements over benchmarks in both global statistical and domain-specific metrics. These findings highlight the effectiveness of GAN-driven semi-supervised learning with log-signatures for irregularly sampled time series and emphasize the importance of uncertainty-aware predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Models for Time Series Forecasting: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14507v2)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, initially developed for image synthesis, demonstrate remarkable generative capabilities. Recently, their application has expanded to time series forecasting (TSF), yielding promising results. Existing surveys on time series primarily focus on the application of diffusion models to time series tasks or merely provide model-by-model introductions of diffusion-based TSF models, without establishing a systematic taxonomy for existing diffusion-based TSF models. In this survey, we firstly introduce several standard diffusion models and their prevalent variants, explaining their adaptation to TSF tasks. Then, we provide a comprehensive review of diffusion models for TSF, paying special attention to the sources of conditional information and the mechanisms for integrating this conditioning within the models. In analyzing existing approaches using diffusion models for TSF, we provide a systematic categorization and a comprehensive summary of them in this survey. Furthermore, we examine several foundational diffusion models applied to TSF, alongside commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss the progress and limitations of these approaches, as well as potential future research directions for diffusion-based TSF. Overall, this survey offers a comprehensive overview of recent progress and future prospects for diffusion models in TSF, serving as a valuable reference for researchers in the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resting-state fMRI Analysis using Quantum Time-series Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00711v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a pivotal tool for revealing intrinsic brain network connectivity and identifying neural biomarkers of neuropsychiatric conditions. However, classical self-attention transformer models--despite their formidable representational power--struggle with quadratic complexity, large parameter counts, and substantial data requirements. To address these barriers, we introduce a Quantum Time-series Transformer, a novel quantum-enhanced transformer architecture leveraging Linear Combination of Unitaries and Quantum Singular Value Transformation. Unlike classical transformers, Quantum Time-series Transformer operates with polylogarithmic computational complexity, markedly reducing training overhead and enabling robust performance even with fewer parameters and limited sample sizes. Empirical evaluation on the largest-scale fMRI datasets from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study and the UK Biobank demonstrates that Quantum Time-series Transformer achieves comparable or superior predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art classical transformer models, with especially pronounced gains in small-sample scenarios. Interpretability analyses using SHapley Additive exPlanations further reveal that Quantum Time-series Transformer reliably identifies clinically meaningful neural biomarkers of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These findings underscore the promise of quantum-enhanced transformers in advancing computational neuroscience by more efficiently modeling complex spatio-temporal dynamics and improving clinical interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text Reinforcement for Multimodal Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00687v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies in time series forecasting (TSF) use multimodal inputs, such as text and historical time series data, to predict future values. These studies mainly focus on developing advanced techniques to integrate textual information with time series data to perform the task and achieve promising results. Meanwhile, these approaches rely on high-quality text and time series inputs, whereas in some cases, the text does not accurately or fully capture the information carried by the historical time series, which leads to unstable performance in multimodal TSF. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the textual content to improve the performance of multimodal TSF. In this paper, we propose improving multimodal TSF by reinforcing the text modalities. We propose a text reinforcement model (TeR) to generate reinforced text that addresses potential weaknesses in the original text, then apply this reinforced text to support the multimodal TSF model's understanding of the time series, improving TSF performance. To guide the TeR toward producing higher-quality reinforced text, we design a reinforcement learning approach that assigns rewards based on the impact of each reinforced text on the performance of the multimodal TSF model and its relevance to the TSF task. We optimize the TeR accordingly, so as to improve the quality of the generated reinforced text and enhance TSF performance. Extensive experiments on a real-world benchmark dataset covering various domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which outperforms strong baselines and existing studies on the dataset.</p></details> |  |

Representing the process of individual behaviour change in computer simulations of these phenomena remains an open challenge. Often, computational models use phenomenological implementations with limited support from behavioural data. Without a strong connection to observable quantities, such models have limited utility for simulating observed and counterfactual scenarios of emergent phenomena because they cannot be validated or calibrated. Here, we present a simple stochastic microsimulation model of reversal learning that captures fundamental properties of individual behaviour change, namely, the capacity to learn based on accumulated reward signals, and the transient persistence of learned behaviour after rewards are removed or altered. The model has only two parameters, and we use approximate Bayesian computation to demonstrate that they are fully identifiable from empirical reversal learning time series data. Finally, we demonstrate how the model can be extended to account for the increased complexity of behavioural dynamics over longer time scales involving fluctuating stimuli. This work is a step towards the development and evaluation of fully identifiable individual-level behaviour change models that can function as validated submodels for complex simulations of collective behaviour change.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |
| **[BALM-TSF: Balanced Multimodal Alignment for LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00622v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is a long-standing and highly challenging research topic. Recently, driven by the rise of large language models (LLMs), research has increasingly shifted from purely time series methods toward harnessing textual modalities to enhance forecasting performance. However, the vast discrepancy between text and temporal data often leads current multimodal architectures to over-emphasise one modality while neglecting the other, resulting in information loss that harms forecasting performance. To address this modality imbalance, we introduce BALM-TSF (Balanced Multimodal Alignment for LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting), a lightweight time series forecasting framework that maintains balance between the two modalities. Specifically, raw time series are processed by the time series encoder, while descriptive statistics of raw time series are fed to an LLM with learnable prompt, producing compact textual embeddings. To ensure balanced cross-modal context alignment of time series and textual embeddings, a simple yet effective scaling strategy combined with a contrastive objective then maps these textual embeddings into the latent space of the time series embeddings. Finally, the aligned textual semantic embeddings and time series embeddings are together integrated for forecasting. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that, with minimal trainable parameters, BALM-TSF achieves state-of-the-art performance in both long-term and few-shot forecasting, confirming its ability to harness complementary information from text and time series. Code is available at https://github.com/ShiqiaoZhou/BALM-TSF.</p></details> |  |
| **[MOPED: A moving sum method for change point detection in pairwise extremal dependence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00585v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is increasingly the case with modern time series that many data sets of practical interest contain abrupt changes in structure. These changes may occur in complex characteristics such as the extremal dependence structure, and identifying such structural breaks remains a challenging problem. Many existing change point detection algorithms focus on changes in dependence across the entire distribution, rather than the tails, and approaches that are tailored to extremes typically make strict parametric assumptions or they are only applicable to bivariate data. We propose a nonparametric MOving sum-based approach for detecting multiple changes in the Pairwise Extremal Dependence (MOPED) of multivariate regularly varying data. To avoid the classical problem of threshold selection in the study of multivariate extremes, we further propose a multiscale, multi-threshold variant of MOPED that pools change point estimates across choices of the threshold and the bandwidth used in local estimation. Good performance of MOPED is illustrated in a simulation study, and we showcase its ability to identify subtle changes in tail dependence class in the absence of correlation changes. We further demonstrate the usefulness of MOPED by identifying changes in the extremal connectivity of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of seizure-prone neonates.</p></details> |  |

Despite their importance, most ML models treat genes as unstructured tokens, discarding known pathway structure. The latest pathway-informed models capture pathway-pathway interactions, but still treat each pathway as a "bag of genes" via MLPs, discarding its topology and gene-gene interactions. We propose a Graph Attention Network (GAT) framework that models pathways at the gene level. We show that GATs generalize much better than MLPs, achieving an 81% reduction in MSE when predicting pathway dynamics under unseen treatment conditions. We further validate the correctness of our biological prior by encoding drug mechanisms via edge interventions, boosting model robustness. Finally, we show that our GAT model is able to correctly rediscover all five gene-gene interactions in the canonical TP53-MDM2-MDM4 feedback loop from raw time-series mRNA data, demonstrating potential to generate novel biological hypotheses directly from experimental data.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

We present a data-driven method leveraging recent advances in score-based generative modeling to construct reduced-order models for such cyclo-stationary time series. Our approach accurately reproduces the statistical properties and temporal correlations of the original data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic trajectories. We demonstrate the performance of the method through application to the Planet Simulator (PlaSim) climate model, constructing a reduced-order model for the 20 leading principal components of surface temperature driven by the annual cycle. The resulting surrogate model accurately reproduces the marginal and joint probability distributions, autocorrelation functions, and spatial coherence of the original climate system across multiple validation metrics. The approach offers substantial computational advantages, enabling generation of centuries of synthetic climate data in minutes compared to weeks required for equivalent full model simulations. This work opens new possibilities for efficient modeling of periodically forced systems across diverse scientific domains, providing a principled framework for balancing computational efficiency with physical fidelity in reduced-order modeling applications.</p></details> |  |

Efforts in leveraging vision models for time series analysis have also been made along the way but are less visible to the community due to the predominant research on sequence modeling in this domain. However, the discrepancy between continuous time series and the discrete token space of LLMs, and the challenges in explicitly modeling the correlations of variates in multivariate time series have shifted some research attentions to the equally successful Large Vision Models (LVMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs). To fill the blank in the existing literature, this survey discusses the advantages of vision models over LLMs in time series analysis. It provides a comprehensive and in-depth overview of the existing methods, with dual views of detailed taxonomy that answer the key research questions including how to encode time series as images and how to model the imaged time series for various tasks. Additionally, we address the challenges in the pre- and post-processing steps involved in this framework and outline future directions to further advance time series analysis with vision models.</p></details> |  |

We propose using data sampled from the real model $\mathbb P$ (which is unknown) with limited size to train a generative model $\mathbb Q$ (from which we can easily and adequately sample). With adaptive training and sampling methods that are tailor-made for time series data, we obtain quantification bounds between $\mathbb P$ and $\mathbb Q$ in terms of the adapted Wasserstein metric $\mathcal A W_2$. Importantly, the proposed adapted sampling method also facilitates {\it conditional sampling}. In the second part of this paper, we provide the stability of the mean-variance portfolio optimization problems in $\mathcal A W _2$. Then, combined with the error bounds and the stability result, we propose a policy gradient algorithm based on the generative environment, in which our innovative adapted sampling method provides approximate scenario generators. We illustrate the performance of our algorithm on both simulated and real data. For real data, the algorithm based on the generative environment produces portfolios that beat several important baselines, including the Markowitz portfolio, the equal weight (naive) portfolio, and S\&P 500.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available on https://github.com/fy-yuan/diffusion_dynamic_mv. v2 addresses certain typos and small issues</p></details> |

Transformer-based architectures such as Autoformer and Informer improve generalization but suffer from quadratic complexity and degraded performance on very long time horizons. State space models, notably S-Mamba, provide linear-time updates but often face unstable training dynamics, sensitivity to initialization, and limited robustness for multivariate forecasting. To address such challenges, we propose the Quantum-Optimized Selective State Space Model (Q-SSM), a hybrid quantum-optimized approach that integrates state space dynamics with a variational quantum gate. Instead of relying on expensive attention mechanisms, Q-SSM employs a simple parametrized quantum circuit (RY-RX ansatz) whose expectation values regulate memory updates adaptively. This quantum gating mechanism improves convergence stability, enhances the modeling of long-term dependencies, and provides a lightweight alternative to attention. We empirically validate Q-SSM on three widely used benchmarks, i.e., ETT, Traffic, and Exchange Rate. Results show that Q-SSM consistently improves over strong baselines (LSTM, TCN, Reformer), Transformer-based models, and S-Mamba. These findings demonstrate that variational quantum gating can address current limitations in long-range forecasting, leading to accurate and robust multivariate predictions.</p></details> |  |

Even when the full causal structure cannot be fully specified, experts often succeed in providing a high-level abstraction of the causal graph, known as a summary causal graph, which captures the main causal relations between different time series while abstracting away micro-level details. In this work, we present conditions that guarantee the orientability of micro-level edges between temporal variables given the background knowledge encoded in a summary causal graph and assuming having access to a faithful and causally sufficient distribution with respect to the true unknown graph. Our results provide theoretical guarantees for edge orientation at the micro-level, even in the presence of cycles or bidirected edges at the macro-level. These findings offer practical guidance for leveraging SCGs to inform causal discovery in complex temporal systems and highlight the value of incorporating expert knowledge to improve causal inference from observational time series data.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we propose a novel task, Time-series Reasoning for Anomaly (Time-RA) that transforms classical time series anomaly detection from a discriminative into a generative, reasoning-intensive task leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Also, we introduce the first real-world multimodal benchmark dataset, RATs40K, explicitly annotated for anomaly reasoning, comprising approximately 40,000 samples across 10 real-world domains. Each sample includes numeric time series data, contextual text information, and visual representations, each annotated with fine-grained categories (14 types for univariate anomalies and 6 for multivariate anomalies) and structured explanatory reasoning. We develop a sophisticated annotation framework utilizing ensemble-generated labels refined through GPT-4-driven feedback, ensuring accuracy and interpretability. Extensive benchmarking of LLMs and multimodal LLMs demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of current models, highlighting the critical role of supervised fine-tuning. Our dataset and task pave the way for significant advancements in interpretable time series anomaly detection and reasoning.

Unlike conventional approaches, where one tests whether the difference $\delta$ of the mean vectors before and after the change point is equal to zero, we argue that the consideration of the null hypothesis $H_0:\|\delta\|\le\Delta$, for some norm $\|\cdot\|$ and a threshold $\Delta>0$, is better suited. By the formulation of the null hypothesis as a composite hypothesis, the change point testing problem becomes significantly more challenging. We develop pivotal inference for testing hypotheses of this type in the setting of high-dimensional time series, first, measuring deviations from the null vector by the $\ell_2$-norm $\|\cdot\|_2$ normalized by the dimension. Second, by measuring deviations using a sparsity adjusted $\ell_2$-"norm" $\|\cdot \|_2/\sqrt{\|\cdot\|_0} $, where $\|\cdot\|_0$ denotes the $\ell_0$-"norm," we propose a pivotal test procedure which intrinsically adapts to sparse alternatives in a data-driven way by pivotally estimating the set of nonzero entries of the vector $\delta$. To establish the statistical validity of our approach, we derive tail bounds of certain classes of distributions that frequently appear as limiting distributions of self-normalized statistics. As a theoretical foundation for all results, we develop a general weak invariance principle for the partial sum process $X_1^\top\xi +\cdots +X_{\lfloor\lambda n\rfloor}^\top\xi$ for a time series $(X_j)_{j\in\mathbb{Z}}$ and a contrast vector $\xi\in\mathbb{R}^p$ under increasing dimension $p$, which is of independent interest. Finally, we investigate the finite sample properties of the tests by means of a simulation study and illustrate its application in a data example.</p></details> |  |

Existing time series synthesis methods typically perform temporal modeling based on random sequences to generate target sequences, which often struggle to ensure the temporal dependencies in the generated time series. Additionally, directly modeling temporal features on random sequences makes it challenging to accurately capture the feature information of the original time series. To address the above issues, we propose a simple but effective generative model \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{L}ayer \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{N}etworks, named \textbf{DLGAN}. The model decomposes the time series generation process into two stages: sequence feature extraction and sequence reconstruction. First, these two stages form a complete time series autoencoder, enabling supervised learning on the original time series to ensure that the reconstruction process can restore the temporal dependencies of the sequence. Second, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is used to generate synthetic feature vectors that align with the real-time sequence feature vectors, ensuring that the generator can capture the temporal features from real time series. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of this model across various evaluation metrics.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

However, when dealing with long-term time series, which span over extended periods and exhibit more complex long-term temporal patterns, the task of generation becomes significantly more challenging. Long-term time series exhibit long-range temporal dependencies, but their data distribution also undergoes gradual changes over time. Finding a balance between these long-term dependencies and the drift in data distribution is a key challenge. On the other hand, long-term time series contain more complex interrelationships between different feature sequences, making the task of effectively capturing both intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies another important challenge. To address these issues, we propose Stage-Diff, a staged generative model for long-term time series based on diffusion models. First, through stage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer, the model preserves long-term sequence dependencies while enabling the modeling of data distribution shifts. Second, within each stage, progressive sequence decomposition is applied to perform channel-independent modeling at different time scales, while inter-stage information transfer utilizes multi-channel fusion modeling. This approach combines the robustness of channel-independent modeling with the information fusion advantages of multi-channel modeling, effectively balancing the intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies of long-term time series. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of Stage-Diff in long-term time series generation tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Change Point Detection on A Separable Model for Dynamic Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17642v5)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the unsupervised change point detection problem in time series of networks using the Separable Temporal Exponential-family Random Graph Model (STERGM). Inherently, dynamic network patterns are complex due to dyadic and temporal dependence, and change points detection can identify the discrepancies in the underlying data generating processes to facilitate downstream analysis. In particular, the STERGM that utilizes network statistics and nodal attributes to represent the structural patterns is a flexible and parsimonious model to fit dynamic networks. We propose a new estimator derived from the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) procedure and Group Fused Lasso (GFL) regularization to simultaneously detect multiple time points where the parameters of a time-heterogeneous STERGM have shifted. Experiments on both simulated and real data show good performance of the proposed framework, and an R package CPDstergm is developed to implement the method.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores the detection of domain shifts using data stream (DS) learning techniques, focusing on the DB6 dataset from the Ninapro database. We define domains as distinct time-series segments based on different subjects and recording sessions, applying Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) with a cosine kernel to pre-process and highlight these shifts. By evaluating multiple drift detection methods such as CUSUM, Page-Hinckley, and ADWIN, we reveal the limitations of current techniques in achieving high performance for real-time domain shift detection in EMG signals. Our results underscore the potential of streaming-based approaches for maintaining stable EMG decoding models, while highlighting areas for further research to enhance robustness and accuracy in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, PRICAI25</p></details> |
| **[CALM: A Framework for Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated Anomaly Detection in Time-Series Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21273v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The detection of anomalies in non-stationary time-series streams is a critical but challenging task across numerous industrial and scientific domains. Traditional models, trained offline, suffer significant performance degradation when faced with concept drift, where the underlying statistical properties of the data change over time. This paper introduces CALM (Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated), a novel, end-to-end framework for real-time anomaly detection designed to address this challenge. CALM is built on the Apache Beam distributed processing framework and leverages the TimesFm foundation model for forecasting-based anomaly detection. The framework's novelty lies in two core contributions. First, it implements a closed-loop, continuous fine-tuning mechanism that allows the anomaly detection model to adapt to evolving data patterns in near real-time. Second, it introduces an LLM-as-a-Judge component, a Large Language Model that provides semantic, context-aware judgments on detected anomalies to curate a high-quality training dataset, deciding whether an anomaly represents transient noise or a meaningful pattern shift. We evaluate CALM on the comprehensive TSB-UAD benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the continuously fine-tuned model improves the ROC AUC score in most datasets compared to the static, pre-trained base model, validating the efficacy of our adaptive, LLM-guided approach to maintaining high-performance anomaly detection in dynamic streaming environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditionally specified graphical modeling of stationary multivariate time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13572v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical models are ubiquitous for summarizing conditional relations in multivariate data. In many applications involving multivariate time series, it is of interest to learn an interaction graph that treats each individual time series as nodes of the graph, with the presence of an edge between two nodes signifying conditional dependence given the others. Typically, the partial covariance is used as a measure of conditional dependence. However, in many applications, the outcomes may not be Gaussian and/or could be a mixture of different outcomes. For such time series using the partial covariance as a measure of conditional dependence may be restrictive. In this article, we propose a broad class of time series models which are specifically designed to succinctly encode process-wide conditional independence in its parameters. For each univariate component in the time series, we model its conditional distribution with a distribution from the exponential family. We develop a notion of process-wide compatibility under which such conditional specifications can be stitched together to form a well-defined strictly stationary multivariate time series. We call this construction a conditionally exponential stationary graphical model (CEStGM). A central quantity underlying CEStGM is a positive kernel which we call the interaction kernel. Spectral properties of such positive kernel operators constitute a core technical foundation of this work. We establish process-wide local and global Markov properties of CEStGM exploiting a Hammersley-Clifford type decomposition of the interaction kernel. Further, we study various probabilistic properties of CEStGM and show that it is geometrically mixing. An approximate Gibbs sampler is also developed to simulate sample paths of CEStGM.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional ESNs often struggle with long-term information processing. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of deep untrained RNNs based on temporal residual connections, called Deep Residual Echo State Networks (DeepResESNs). We show that leveraging a hierarchy of untrained residual recurrent layers significantly boosts memory capacity and long-term temporal modeling. For the temporal residual connections, we consider different orthogonal configurations, including randomly generated and fixed-structure configurations, and we study their effect on network dynamics. A thorough mathematical analysis outlines necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure stable dynamics within DeepResESN. Our experiments on a variety of time series tasks showcase the advantages of the proposed approach over traditional shallow and deep RC.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Our approach uses Fourier neural operators to learn macroscopic traffic flow dynamics from high-fidelity data. During inference, the operator functions as an open-loop predictor of traffic evolution. To close the loop, we couple the open-loop operator with a correction operator that combines the predicted density with sparse measurements from the sensors. Simulations with the SUMO software indicate that, compared to open-loop observers, the proposed closed-loop observer exhibits classical closed-loop properties such as robustness to noise and ultimate boundedness of the error. This shows the advantages of combining learned physics with real-time corrections, and opens avenues for accurate, efficient, and interpretable data-driven observers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety-Critical Multi-Agent MCTS for Mixed Traffic Coordination at Unsignalized Roundabout](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01856v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision-making at unsignalized roundabouts poses substantial challenges for autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in mixed traffic environments where AVs must coordinate safely with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). This paper presents a safety-critical multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework that integrates both deterministic and probabilistic prediction models to facilitate cooperative decision-making in complex roundabout scenarios. The proposed framework introduces three key innovations: (1) a hierarchical safety assessment module that systematically addresses AV-to-AV (A2A), AV-to-HDV (A2H), and AV-to-Road (A2R) interactions through dynamic safety thresholds and spatiotemporal risk evaluation; (2) an adaptive HDV behavior prediction scheme that combines the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) with probabilistic uncertainty modeling; and (3) a multi-objective reward optimization strategy that jointly considers safety, efficiency, and cooperative intent. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach under both fully autonomous (100% AVs) and mixed traffic (50% AVs + 50% HDVs) conditions. Compared to benchmark methods, our framework consistently reduces trajectory deviations across all AVs and significantly lowers the rate of Post-Encroachment Time (PET) violations, achieving only 1.0\% in the fully autonomous scenario and 3.2% in the mixed traffic setting.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

This paper reviews 147 recent studies, focusing on the application of supervised, unsupervised, and hybrid deep learning models for accident prediction, alongside the use of real-world and synthetic datasets. Current methodologies are categorized into four key approaches: image and video feature-based prediction, spatio-temporal feature-based prediction, scene understanding, and multi modal data fusion. While these methods demonstrate significant potential, challenges such as data scarcity, limited generalization to complex scenarios, and real-time performance constraints remain prevalent. This review highlights opportunities for future research, including the integration of multi modal data fusion, self-supervised learning, and Transformer-based architectures to enhance prediction accuracy and scalability. By synthesizing existing advancements and identifying critical gaps, this paper provides a foundational reference for developing robust and adaptive Vision-TAA systems, contributing to road safety and traffic management.</p></details> |  |
| **[EvolveSignal: A Large Language Model Powered Coding Agent for Discovering Traffic Signal Control Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03335v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In traffic engineering, the fixed-time traffic signal control remains widely used for its low cost, stability, and interpretability. However, its design depends on hand-crafted formulas (e.g., Webster) and manual re-timing by engineers to adapt to demand changes, which is labor-intensive and often yields suboptimal results under heterogeneous or congested conditions. This paper introduces the EvolveSignal, a large language models (LLMs) powered coding agent to automatically discover new traffic signal control algorithms. We formulate the problem as program synthesis, where candidate algorithms are represented as Python functions with fixed input-output structures, and iteratively optimized through external evaluations (e.g., a traffic simulator) and evolutionary search. Experiments on a signalized intersection demonstrate that the discovered algorithms outperform Webster's baseline, reducing average delay by 20.1% and average stops by 47.1%. Beyond performance, ablation and incremental analyses reveal that EvolveSignal modifications-such as adjusting cycle length bounds, incorporating right-turn demand, and rescaling green allocations-can offer practically meaningful insights for traffic engineers. This work opens a new research direction by leveraging AI for algorithm design in traffic signal control, bridging program synthesis with transportation engineering.</p></details> |  |

Our experiments show cross-validated results of up to 92% accuracy when classifying accident severity using the proposed deep neural network.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 17th International Conference on Data Science (ICDATA 2021)</p></details> |

To address the challenges of environmental complexity and aircraft diversity in the traffic management, we propose a hierarchical low-altitude wireless network (HLWN) framework. Empowered by the threedimensional spatial discretization and integrated wireless monitoring mechanisms in HLWN, we design low-altitude air corridors to guarantee safe operation and optimization. Besides, we develop the multi-dimensional flight risk assessment through conflict detection and probabilistic collision analysis, facilitating dynamic collision avoidance for heterogeneous aircrafts. Finally, the open issues and future directions are investigated to provide insights into HLAN development.</p></details> | 7 pages 6 figures |
| **[Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization for Traffic Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15079v4)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern intelligent transportation systems rely on accurate spatiotemporal traffic analysis to optimize urban mobility and infrastructure resilience. However, pervasive missing data caused by sensor failures and heterogeneous sensing gaps fundamentally hinders reliable traffic modeling. This paper proposes a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model that synergizes low-rank tensor algebra with deep representation learning for robust traffic data imputation. The model innovatively embeds CP decomposition into neural architecture through learnable embedding projections, where sparse traffic tensors are encoded into dense latent factors across road segments, time intervals, and mobility metrics. A hierarchical feature fusion mechanism employs Hadamard products to explicitly model multilinear interactions, while stacked multilayer perceptron layers nonlinearly refine these representations to capture complex spatiotemporal couplings. Extensive evaluations on six urban traffic datasets demonstrate NCPF's superiority over six state-of-the-art baselines. By unifying CP decomposition's interpretable factor analysis with neural network's nonlinear expressive power, NCPF provides a principled yet flexible approaches for high-dimensional traffic data imputation, offering critical support for next-generation transportation digital twins and adaptive traffic control systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Traffic Signal Control with Predictable Cycle Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03118v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a popular approach in traffic signal control (TSC) due to its ability to learn adaptive policies from complex traffic environments. Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control paradigms are ``choose phase" and ``switch" strategies. Although the agent in the choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this paradigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their anticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile, the switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next predefined phase or extend the current phase. While this structure maintains a more predictable order, it can lead to unfair and inefficient phase allocations, as certain movements may be extended disproportionately while others are neglected. In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep Hierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle duration hierarchically. A high-level agent first determines the split of the total cycle time between the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions based on the overall traffic state. Then, a low-level agent further divides the allocated duration within each major direction between straight and left-turn movements, enabling more flexible durations for the two movements. We test our model on both real and synthetic road networks, along with multiple sets of real and synthetic traffic flows. Empirical results show our model achieves the best performance over all datasets against baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatically Generating High-Precision Simulated Road Networking in Traffic Scenario](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02990v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing lane-level simulation road network generation is labor-intensive, resource-demanding, and costly due to the need for large-scale data collection and manual post-editing. To overcome these limitations, we propose automatically generating high-precision simulated road networks in traffic scenario, an efficient and fully automated solution. Initially, real-world road street view data is collected through open-source street view map platforms, and a large-scale street view lane line dataset is constructed to provide a robust foundation for subsequent analysis. Next, an end-to-end lane line detection approach based on deep learning is designed, where a neural network model is trained to accurately detect the number and spatial distribution of lane lines in street view images, enabling automated extraction of lane information. Subsequently, by integrating coordinate transformation and map matching algorithms, the extracted lane information from street views is fused with the foundational road topology obtained from open-source map service platforms, resulting in the generation of a high-precision lane-level simulation road network. This method significantly reduces the costs associated with data collection and manual editing while enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of simulation road network generation. It provides reliable data support for urban traffic simulation, autonomous driving navigation, and the development of intelligent transportation systems, offering a novel technical pathway for the automated modeling of large-scale urban road networks.</p></details> | 7 pages,11 figures |
| **[Diffusion-RL Based Air Traffic Conflict Detection and Resolution Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03550v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of continuously rising global air traffic, efficient and safe Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R) is paramount for air traffic management. Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising pathway for CD&R automation, existing approaches commonly suffer from a "unimodal bias" in their policies. This leads to a critical lack of decision-making flexibility when confronted with complex and dynamic constraints, often resulting in "decision deadlocks." To overcome this limitation, this paper pioneers the integration of diffusion probabilistic models into the safety-critical task of CD&R, proposing a novel autonomous conflict resolution framework named Diffusion-AC. Diverging from conventional methods that converge to a single optimal solution, our framework models its policy as a reverse denoising process guided by a value function, enabling it to generate a rich, high-quality, and multimodal action distribution. This core architecture is complemented by a Density-Progressive Safety Curriculum (DPSC), a training mechanism that ensures stable and efficient learning as the agent progresses from sparse to high-density traffic environments. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms a suite of state-of-the-art DRL benchmarks. Most critically, in the most challenging high-density scenarios, Diffusion-AC not only maintains a high success rate of 94.1% but also reduces the incidence of Near Mid-Air Collisions (NMACs) by approximately 59% compared to the next-best-performing baseline, significantly enhancing the system's safety margin. This performance leap stems from its unique multimodal decision-making capability, which allows the agent to flexibly switch to effective alternative maneuvers.</p></details> | <details><summary>59 pa...</summary><p>59 pages,13 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Among operational loads, traffic load plays a pivotal role, and recent advances in deep learning - particularly in computer vision (CV) - have enabled progress toward continuous, automated monitoring. However, CV-based approaches suffer from limitations, including privacy concerns and sensitivity to lighting conditions, while traditional non-vision-based methods often lack flexibility in deployment and validation. To bridge this gap, we propose a fully automated deep-learning pipeline for continuous traffic monitoring using structural health monitoring (SHM) sensor networks. Our approach integrates CV-assisted high-resolution dataset generation with supervised training and inference, leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture the spatial structure and interdependence of sensor data. By transferring knowledge from CV outputs to SHM sensors, the proposed framework enables sensor networks to achieve comparable accuracy of vision-based systems, with minimal human intervention. Applied to accelerometer and strain gauge data in a real-world case study, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with classification accuracies of 99% for light vehicles and 94% for heavy vehicles.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches prioritize prediction accuracy without considering deployment constraints or the dynamism of network traffic, leading to potentially suboptimal performance. Because of this, deploying ML models in real-world networks with tight performance constraints remains an open challenge. In contrast with existing work that aims to select an optimal candidate model for each task based on offline information, we propose an online, system-driven approach to dynamically select the best ML model for network traffic analysis. To this end, we present Cruise Control, a system that pre-trains several models for a given task with different accuracy-cost tradeoffs and selects the most appropriate model based on lightweight signals representing the system's current traffic processing ability. Experimental results using two real-world traffic analysis tasks demonstrate Cruise Control's effectiveness in adapting to changing network conditions. Our evaluation shows that Cruise Control improves median accuracy by 2.78% while reducing packet loss by a factor of four compared to offline-selected models.</p></details> |  |

We present a segment routing over IPv6 (SRv6) flexible algorithm (Flex-Algo) framework that consists of three logical slices: an energy-efficient slice (Algo 130), a high-reliability slice (Algo 129), and a latency-sensitive slice (Algo 128). The framework provides a unified mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that combines satellite CPU power, packet delivery rate (PDR), and end-to-end latency into a single objective, allowing a lightweight software-defined network (SDN) controller to steer traffic from the source node. Emulation of Telesat's Lightspeed constellation shows that, compared with different routing schemes, the proposed design reduces the average CPU usage by 73%, maintains a PDR above 91% during traffic bursts, and decreases urgent flow delay by 18 ms between Ottawa and Vancouver.

In this context, we introduce in this paper, FlexNGIA 2.0, an Agentic AI-driven Internet architecture that leverages LLM-based AI agents to autonomously orchestrate, configure, and evolve the network. These agents can, at runtime, perceive, reason, coordinate among themselves to dynamically design, implement, deploy, and adapt communication protocols, Service Function Chains (SFCs), network functions, resource allocation strategies, congestion control, and traffic engineering schemes, thereby ensuring optimal performance, reliability, and efficiency under evolving conditions. The paper first outlines the overall architecture of FlexNGIA 2.0 and its constituent LLM-Based AI agents. For each agent, we detail its design, implementation, inputs and outputs, prompt structures, interactions with tools and other agents, followed by preliminary proof-of-concept experiments demonstrating its operation and potential. The results clearly highlight the ability of these LLM-based AI agents to automate the design, the implementation, the deployment, and the performance evaluation of transport protocols, service function chains, network functions, congestion control schemes, and resource allocation strategies. FlexNGIA 2.0 paves the way for a new class of Agentic AI-Driven networks, where fully cognitive, self-evolving AI agents can autonomously design, implement, adapt and optimize the network's protocols, algorithms, and behaviors to efficiently operate across complex, dynamic, and heterogeneous environments. To bring this vision to reality, we also identify key research challenges toward achieving fully autonomous, adaptive, and agentic AI-driven networks.</p></details> |  |

The main obstacle is that trajectory data are prone to measurement noise. While this is negligible for city level, large-scale flow aggregation, it poses substantial difficulties for road level, small-scale aggregation. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. We deploy these algorithms in an iterative workflow to compute locally aligned flow maps. By applying this workflow to synthetic and empirical trajectories, we verify that our locally aligned flow maps provide high levels of accuracy and spatial resolution of flow aggregation at multiple scales for static and interactive maps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simplifying Traffic Anomaly Detection with Video Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09338v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent methods for ego-centric Traffic Anomaly Detection (TAD) often rely on complex multi-stage or multi-representation fusion architectures, yet it remains unclear whether such complexity is necessary. Recent findings in visual perception suggest that foundation models, enabled by advanced pre-training, allow simple yet flexible architectures to outperform specialized designs. Therefore, in this work, we investigate an architecturally simple encoder-only approach using plain Video Vision Transformers (Video ViTs) and study how pre-training enables strong TAD performance. We find that: (i) advanced pre-training enables simple encoder-only models to match or even surpass the performance of specialized state-of-the-art TAD methods, while also being significantly more efficient; (ii) although weakly- and fully-supervised pre-training are advantageous on standard benchmarks, we find them less effective for TAD. Instead, self-supervised Masked Video Modeling (MVM) provides the strongest signal; and (iii) Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT) on unlabeled driving videos further improves downstream performance, without requiring anomalous examples. Our findings highlight the importance of pre-training and show that effective, efficient, and scalable TAD models can be built with minimal architectural complexity.

An innovative geometric indicator, based on the analysis of safety zones using adaptive ellipses, is used to accurately quantify collision risks. Our method applies the Shoelace formula to compute the intersection area in the case of misaligned and time-varying configurations. Comfort is modeled using indicators centered on longitudinal and lateral jerk, while efficiency is assessed by overall travel time. These criteria are aggregated into a comprehensive objective function solved using a PSO based algorithm. The approach was successfully validated under real traffic conditions via experiments conducted in an urban intersection involving an autonomous vehicle interacting with a human-operated vehicle, and in simulation using data recorded from human driving in real traffic.</p></details> |  |
| **[Redesigning Traffic Signs to Mitigate Machine-Learning Patch Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04660v3)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic-Sign Recognition (TSR) is a critical safety component for autonomous driving. Unfortunately, however, past work has highlighted the vulnerability of TSR models to physical-world attacks, through low-cost, easily deployable adversarial patches leading to misclassification. To mitigate these threats, most defenses focus on altering the training process or modifying the inference procedure. Still, while these approaches improve adversarial robustness, TSR remains susceptible to attacks attaining substantial success rates. To further the adversarial robustness of TSR, this work offers a novel approach that redefines traffic-sign designs to create signs that promote robustness while remaining interpretable to humans. Our framework takes three inputs: (1) A traffic-sign standard along with modifiable features and associated constraints; (2) A state-of-the-art adversarial training method; and (3) A function for efficiently synthesizing realistic traffic-sign images. Using these user-defined inputs, the framework emits an optimized traffic-sign standard such that traffic signs generated per this standard enable training TSR models with increased adversarial robustness. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework via a concrete implementation, where we allow modifying the pictograms (i.e., symbols) and colors of traffic signs. The results show substantial improvements in robustness -- with gains of up to 16.33%--24.58% in robust accuracy over state-of-the-art methods -- while benign accuracy is even improved. Importantly, a user study also confirms that the redesigned traffic signs remain easily recognizable and to human observers. Overall, the results highlight that carefully redesigning traffic signs can significantly enhance TSR system robustness without compromising human interpretability.</p></details> |  |

We consider a high-dimensional bipartite matching system under uncertainty and seek an effective dynamic control policy that maximizes the expected discounted total value generated by the matches minus the congestion-related costs. To derive a tractable approximation, we focus attention on balanced, high-volume systems, i.e., the heavy-traffic regime, and derive an approximating Brownian control problem. We then develop a computational method that relies on deep neural network technology for solving this problem. To show the effectiveness of the policy derived from our computational method, we compare it to the benchmark policies available in the extant literature in the context of the original matching problem.

Existing TE schemes either reroute traffic over vulnerable static paths, leading to performance degradation, or precompute backup routes for a broad range of failure scenarios, which introduces high overhead and limits scalability. Hence, an effective failure recovery mechanism is required to offer sufficient path diversity under constrained overhead, thereby ensuring robust and performant network operation. This paper presents ReWeave, a scalable and efficient link-level TE scheme that enables localized rerouting by equipping each link with a compact set of adjacent-only backup paths. Upon detecting a failure, only the routers at both ends of the failed link reroute traffic dynamically using SRv6-based detours, without controller intervention or full-path recomputation. Evaluation results on large-scale backbone networks demonstrate that ReWeave outperforms existing TE schemes in link failure scenarios. Compared to HARP, the state-of-the-art failure recovery scheme based on centralized control and dynamic traffic reallocation, our approach reduces the average maximum link utilization by 10.5%~20.1%, and lowers the worst-case utilization by 29.5%~40.9%. When compared with Flexile, a protection-based scheme that precomputes routes for multi-failure scenarios, ReWeave achieves a similarly low packet loss rate in 90% of failure cases, while maintaining a response speed comparable to the fastest router-based local rerouting schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE ICNP 2025</p></details> |

In this paper,we present X-PRINT,the first server-centric,URI-based framework for cross-platform fine-grained encrypted-traffic fingerprinting.X-PRINT systematically demonstrates that backend URI invocation patterns can serve as platform-agnostic invariants and are effective for mod-eling fine-grained behaviors.To achieve robust identifica-tion,X-PRINT further leverages temporally structured URI maps for behavior inference and emphasizes the exclusion of platform-or application-specific private URIs to handle unseen cases,thereby improving reliability in open-world and cross-platform settings.Extensive experiments across diverse cross-platform and open-world settings show that X-PRINT achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in fine-grained fingerprint-ing and exhibits strong scalability and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Dataset Cleaning Framework for Encrypted Traffic Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00701v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic classification, a technique for assigning network flows to predefined categories, has been widely deployed in enterprise and carrier networks. With the massive adoption of mobile devices, encryption is increasingly used in mobile applications to address privacy concerns. Consequently, traditional methods such as Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) fail to distinguish encrypted traffic. To tackle this challenge, Artificial Intelligence (AI), in particular Machine Learning (ML), has emerged as a promising solution for encrypted traffic classification. A crucial prerequisite for any ML-based approach is traffic data cleaning, which removes flows that are not useful for training (e.g., irrelevant protocols, background activity, control-plane messages, and long-lived sessions). Existing cleaning solutions depend on manual inspection of every captured packet, making the process both costly and time-consuming. In this poster, we present an unsupervised framework that automatically cleans encrypted mobile traffic. Evaluation on real-world datasets shows that our framework incurs only a 2%~2.5% reduction in classification accuracy compared with manual cleaning. These results demonstrate that our method offers an efficient and effective preprocessing step for ML-based encrypted traffic classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE ICNP 2025 Poster</p></details> |
| **[SocialTrack: Multi-Object Tracking in Complex Urban Traffic Scenes Inspired by Social Behavior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12777v3)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a key research direction in the field of multi-object tracking (MOT), UAV-based multi-object tracking has significant application value in the analysis and understanding of urban intelligent transportation systems. However, in complex UAV perspectives, challenges such as small target scale variations, occlusions, nonlinear crossing motions, and motion blur severely hinder the stability of multi-object tracking. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel multi-object tracking framework, SocialTrack, aimed at enhancing the tracking accuracy and robustness of small targets in complex urban traffic environments. The specialized small-target detector enhances the detection performance by employing a multi-scale feature enhancement mechanism. The Velocity Adaptive Cubature Kalman Filter (VACKF) improves the accuracy of trajectory prediction by incorporating a velocity dynamic modeling mechanism. The Group Motion Compensation Strategy (GMCS) models social group motion priors to provide stable state update references for low-quality tracks, significantly improving the target association accuracy in complex dynamic environments. Furthermore, the Spatio-Temporal Memory Prediction (STMP) leverages historical trajectory information to predict the future state of low-quality tracks, effectively mitigating identity switching issues. Extensive experiments on the UAVDT and MOT17 datasets demonstrate that SocialTrack outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across several key metrics. Significant improvements in MOTA and IDF1, among other core performance indicators, highlight its superior robustness and adaptability. Additionally, SocialTrack is highly modular and compatible, allowing for seamless integration with existing trackers to further enhance performance.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in spatial-temporal models have markedly improved the modeling of intricate spatial-temporal correlations for traffic forecasting. Unfortunately, most previous studies have encountered challenges in effectively modeling spatial-temporal correlations across various perceptual perspectives, which have neglected the interactive fusion between traffic patterns and spatial correlations. Additionally, constrained by spatial heterogeneity, most studies fail to consider distinct regional heterogeneity during message-passing. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Pattern-Spatial Interactive and Regional Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (PSIRAGCN) for traffic forecasting. Specifically, we propose a pattern-spatial interactive fusion framework composed of pattern and spatial modules. This framework aims to capture patterns and spatial correlations by adopting a perception perspective from the global to the local level and facilitating mutual utilization with positive feedback. In the spatial module, we designed a graph convolutional network based on message-passing. The network is designed to leverage a regional characteristics bank to reconstruct data-driven message-passing with regional awareness. Reconstructed message passing can reveal the regional heterogeneity between nodes in the traffic network. Extensive experiments on three real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that PSIRAGCN outperforms the State-of-the-art baseline while balancing computational costs.</p></details> |  |

This neglects the significant impact of lateral decisions, such as lane changes, on overall energy efficiency, especially in environments with traffic signals and heterogeneous traffic flow. To address this gap, we propose a novel energy-aware motion planning framework that jointly optimizes longitudinal speed and lateral lane-change decisions using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. Our approach estimates long-term energy costs using a graph-based approximation and solves short-horizon optimal control problems under traffic constraints. Using a data-driven energy model calibrated to an actual battery electric vehicle, we demonstrate with vehicle-in-the-loop experiments that our method reduces motion energy consumption by up to 24 percent compared to a human driver, highlighting the potential of connectivity-enabled planning for sustainable urban autonomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC25')</p></details> |

| **[Traffic State Estimation in Congestion to Extend Applicability of DFOS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21138v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a traffic state estimation (TSE) method in congestion for distributed fiber-optic sensing (DFOS). DFOS detects vehicle driving vibrations along the optical fiber and obtains their trajectories in the spatiotemporal plane. From these trajectories, DFOS provides mean velocities for real-time spatially continuous traffic monitoring without dead zones. However, when vehicle vibration intensities are insufficiently low due to slow speed, trajectories cannot be obtained, leading to missing values in mean velocity data. It restricts DFOS applicability in severe congestion. Therefore, this paper proposes a missing value imputation method based on data assimilation. Our proposed method is validated on two expressways in Japan with the reference data. The results show that the mean absolute error (MAE) of the imputed mean velocities to the reference increases only by 1.5 km/h as compared with the MAE of non-missing values. This study enhances the wide-range applicability of DFOS in practical cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, presented in the 31st ITS World Congress</p></details> |

Deep learning has advanced video-based traffic monitoring through video question answering (VideoQA) models, enabling structured insight extraction from traffic videos. However, existing VideoQA models struggle with the complexity of real-world traffic scenes, where multiple concurrent events unfold across spatiotemporal dimensions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \textbf{InterAct VideoQA}, a curated dataset designed to benchmark and enhance VideoQA models for traffic monitoring tasks. The InterAct VideoQA dataset comprises 8 hours of real-world traffic footage collected from diverse intersections, segmented into 10-second video clips, with over 25,000 question-answer (QA) pairs covering spatiotemporal dynamics, vehicle interactions, incident detection, and other critical traffic attributes. State-of-the-art VideoQA models are evaluated on InterAct VideoQA, exposing challenges in reasoning over fine-grained spatiotemporal dependencies within complex traffic scenarios. Additionally, fine-tuning these models on InterAct VideoQA yields notable performance improvements, demonstrating the necessity of domain-specific datasets for VideoQA.

Pretrained models for network traffic can utilize large-scale raw data to learn the essential characteristics of network traffic, and generate distinguishable results for input traffic without considering specific downstream tasks. Effective pretrained models can significantly optimize the training efficiency and effectiveness of downstream tasks, such as application classification, attack detection and traffic generation. Despite the great success of pretraining in natural language processing, there is no work in the network field. Considering the diverse demands and characteristics of network traffic and network tasks, it is non-trivial to build a pretrained model for network traffic and we face various challenges, especially the heterogeneous headers and payloads in the multi-pattern network traffic and the different dependencies for contexts of diverse downstream network tasks. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we make the first attempt to provide a generative pretrained model NetGPT for both traffic understanding and generation tasks. We propose the multi-pattern network traffic modeling to construct unified text inputs and support both traffic understanding and generation tasks. We further optimize the adaptation effect of the pretrained model to diversified tasks by shuffling header fields, segmenting packets in flows, and incorporating diverse task labels with prompts. With diverse traffic datasets from encrypted software, DNS, private industrial protocols and cryptocurrency mining, expensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our NetGPT in a range of traffic understanding and generation tasks on traffic datasets, and outperform state-of-the-art baselines by a wide margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/ict-net/NetGPT</p></details> |

However, thermal cameras encounter challenges when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose FlowletFormer, a BERT-based pre-training model specifically designed for network traffic analysis. FlowletFormer introduces a Coherent Behavior-Aware Traffic Representation Model for segmenting traffic into semantically meaningful units, a Protocol Stack Alignment-Based Embedding Layer to capture multilayer protocol semantics, and Field-Specific and Context-Aware Pretraining Tasks to enhance both inter-packet and inter-flow learning. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowletFormer significantly outperforms existing methods in the effectiveness of traffic representation, classification accuracy, and few-shot learning capability. Moreover, by effectively integrating domain-specific network knowledge, FlowletFormer shows better comprehension of the principles of network transmission (e.g., stateful connections of TCP), providing a more robust and trustworthy framework for traffic analysis.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose FlowDet, a high-speed detector featuring a decoupled encoder optimization strategy applied to the DETR architecture. Specifically, FlowDet employs a novel Geometric Deformable Unit (GDU) for traffic-aware geometric modeling and a Scale-Aware Attention (SAA) module to maintain high representational power across extreme scale variations. To rigorously evaluate the model's performance in environments with severe occlusion and high object density, we collected the Intersection-Flow-5k dataset, a new challenging scene for this task. Evaluated on Intersection-Flow-5k, FlowDet establishes a new state-of-the-art. Compared to the strong RT-DETR baseline, it improves AP(test) by 1.5% and AP50(test) by 1.6%, while simultaneously reducing GFLOPs by 63.2% and increasing inference speed by 16.2%.

Neural operators have recently gained attention as promising tools for modeling traffic flow. While effective at learning function space mappings, they inherently produce smooth predictions that fail to reconstruct high-frequency features such as sharp density gradients which results in rapid error accumulation during multi-step rollout predictions essential for real-time traffic management. To address these fundamental limitations, we introduce a unified Diffusion-Enhanced Transformer Neural Operator (DETNO) architecture. DETNO leverages a transformer neural operator with cross-attention mechanisms, providing model expressivity and super-resolution, coupled with a diffusion-based refinement component that iteratively reconstructs high-frequency traffic details through progressive denoising. This overcomes the inherent smoothing limitations and rollout instability of standard neural operators. Through comprehensive evaluation on chaotic traffic datasets, our method demonstrates superior performance in extended rollout predictions compared to traditional and transformer-based neural operators, preserving high-frequency components and improving stability over long prediction horizons.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Highway Traffic Flow in Mixed Autonomy: A Multiagent Truncated Rollout Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19203v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offers substantial opportunities to enhance traffic efficiency. However, in mixed autonomy environments where CAVs coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs), achieving efficient coordination among CAVs remains challenging due to heterogeneous driving behaviors. To address this, this paper proposes a multiagent truncated rollout approach that enhances CAV speed coordination to improve highway throughput while reducing computational overhead. In this approach, a traffic density evolution equation is formulated that comprehensively accounts for the presence or absence of CAVs, and a distributed coordination control framework is established accordingly. By incorporating kinematic information from neighbor agents and employing an agent-by-agent sequential solution mechanism, our method enables explicit cooperation among CAVs. Furthermore, we introduce a truncated rollout scheme that adaptively shortens the optimization horizon based on the evaluation of control sequences. This significantly reduces the time complexity, thereby improving real-time performance and scalability. Theoretical analysis provides rigorous guarantees on the stability and performance improvement of the system. Simulations conducted on real-world bottleneck scenarios demonstrate that, in large-scale mixed traffic flows, the proposed method outperforms conventional model predictive control methods by reducing both the average travel time in the bottleneck area and overall computational time, highlighting its strong potential for practical deployment.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this, we combine offline network optimization heuristics with online admission control and, thus, allow for new flow registrations while the network is running. We demonstrate our solution on Credit-Based Shaper networks by using the delay analysis framework Network Calculus. We compare our approach with an intuitive and a brute-force algorithm, where we can achieve significant improvements, both, in terms of quality and runtime.

However, large-scale UAM operations connecting multiple origin-destination pairs raise concerns about air traffic safety and efficiency due to potential conflict movements, particularly at major conflict points analogous to roadway junctions. To meet the safety and efficiency requirements of future UAM operations, this work proposes an air traffic management framework that integrates route guidance and collision avoidance. The route guidance mechanism optimizes aircraft distribution across both spatial and temporal dimensions by regulating their paths (composed of waypoints). Given the optimized paths, the collision avoidance algorithm generates collision-free aircraft trajectories between waypoints in the 3D space. To enable large-scale applications, we develop fast approximation methods for centralized path planning and adopt the velocity obstacle model for distributed collision avoidance. To our knowledge, this work is one of the first to integrate route guidance and collision avoidance for UAM. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework enables efficient and flexible UAM operations, including air traffic assignment, local congestion mitigation, and dynamic no-fly zone management. Compared with a collision-free baseline strategy, the proposed framework achieves considerable improvements in traffic safety and efficiency, with increases in the average minimum separation (+98.2%), the average travel speed (+70.2%), and the trip completion rate (+130%), along with a reduction in the energy consumption (-23.0%). The proposed framework demonstrates its potential for real-time traffic simulation and management in large-scale UAM systems.</p></details> | 26 pages |

Because most road users are human drivers, reproducing their diverse behaviors within simulators is vital. Existing solutions, however, typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or narrow data-driven models, which capture only fragments of real driving behaviors and offer limited driving style diversity and interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce HDSim, an HD traffic generation framework that combines cognitive theory with large language model (LLM) assistance to produce scalable and realistic traffic scenarios within simulation platforms. The framework advances the state of the art in two ways: (i) it introduces a hierarchical driver model that represents diverse driving style traits, and (ii) it develops a Perception-Mediated Behavior Influence strategy, where LLMs guide perception to indirectly shape driver actions. Experiments reveal that embedding HDSim into simulation improves detection of safety-critical failures in self-driving systems by up to 68% and yields realism-consistent accident interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Physical analogies for complicated network behavior can be a useful aid to understanding these newly discovered network phenomena. Prior work leveraged the canonical Gull's Lighthouse problem and developed a computational heuristic for modeling large scale network traffic using this model. A general solution using this approach requires overcoming the essential mathematical singularities in the resulting differential equations. Further investigation reveals a simpler physical interpretation that alleviates the need for solving challenging differential equations. Specifically, that the probability of observing a source at a temporal ``distance'' $r(t)$ at time $t$ is $p(t) \propto 1/r(t)^2$. This analogy aligns with many physical phenomena and can be a rich source of intuition. Applying this physical analogy to the observed source correlations in the Anonymized Network Sensing Graph Challenge data leads to an elegant cyber orbit analogy that may assist with the understanding network behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 pag...</summary><p>2 pages, 1 figure, 10 reference, to appear at IEEE HPEC 2025</p></details> |

Yet, traditional datasets are usually captured by fixed sensors mounted on a car and are susceptible to occlusion. Additionally, such an approach can precisely reconstruct the dynamic environment in the close vicinity of the measurement vehicle only, while neglecting objects that are further away. In this paper, we introduce the DeepScenario Open 3D Dataset (DSC3D), a high-quality, occlusion-free dataset of 6 degrees of freedom bounding box trajectories acquired through a novel monocular camera drone tracking pipeline. Our dataset includes more than 175,000 trajectories of 14 types of traffic participants and significantly exceeds existing datasets in terms of diversity and scale, containing many unprecedented scenarios such as complex vehicle-pedestrian interaction on highly populated urban streets and comprehensive parking maneuvers from entry to exit. DSC3D dataset was captured in five various locations in Europe and the United States and include: a parking lot, a crowded inner-city, a steep urban intersection, a federal highway, and a suburban intersection. Our 3D trajectory dataset aims to enhance autonomous driving systems by providing detailed environmental 3D representations, which could lead to improved obstacle interactions and safety. We demonstrate its utility across multiple applications including motion prediction, motion planning, scenario mining, and generative reactive traffic agents.

In particular, as a powerful evolutionary machine learning approach, Genetic Programming (GP) is utilized to evolve human-understandable phase urgency functions to measure the urgency of activating a green light for a specific phase. However, current GP-based methods are unable to treat the common traffic features of different traffic signal phases consistently. To address this issue, we propose to use a symmetric phase urgency function to calculate the phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. This is represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the urgency of a turn movement in the phase. We then propose a GP method to evolve the symmetric phase urgency function. We evaluate our proposed method on the well-known cityflow traffic simulator, based on multiple public real-world datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed symmetric urgency function representation can significantly improve the performance of the learned traffic signal control policies over the traditional GP representation on a wide range of scenarios. Further analysis shows that the proposed method can evolve effective, human-understandable and easily deployable traffic signal control policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[STGAtt: A Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph Attention Network for Traffic Flow Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16685v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and timely traffic flow forecasting is crucial for intelligent transportation systems. This paper presents a novel deep learning model, the Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph Attention Network (STGAtt). By leveraging a unified graph representation and an attention mechanism, STGAtt effectively captures complex spatial-temporal dependencies. Unlike methods relying on separate spatial and temporal dependency modeling modules, STGAtt directly models correlations within a Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph, dynamically weighing connections across both dimensions. To further enhance its capabilities, STGAtt partitions traffic flow observation signal into neighborhood subsets and employs a novel exchanging mechanism, enabling effective capture of both short-range and long-range correlations. Extensive experiments on the PEMS-BAY and SHMetro datasets demonstrate STGAtt's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines across various prediction horizons. Visualization of attention weights confirms STGAtt's ability to adapt to dynamic traffic patterns and capture long-range dependencies, highlighting its potential for real-world traffic flow forecasting applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[A CASP-based Solution for Traffic Signal Optimisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19061v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of urban traffic control, traffic signal optimisation is the problem of determining the optimal green length for each signal in a set of traffic signals. The literature has effectively tackled such a problem, mostly with automated planning techniques leveraging the PDDL+ language and solvers. However, such language has limitations when it comes to specifying optimisation statements and computing optimal plans. In this paper, we provide an alternative solution to the traffic signal optimisation problem based on Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP). We devise an encoding in a CASP language, which is then solved by means of clingcon 3, a system extending the well-known ASP solver clingo. We performed experiments on real historical data from the town of Huddersfield in the UK, comparing our approach to the PDDL+ model that obtained the best results for the considered benchmark. The results showed the potential of our approach for tackling the traffic signal optimisation problem and improving the solution quality of the PDDL+ plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP), Proceedings of ICLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Digital Life of Parisian Parks: Multifunctionality and Urban Context Uncovered by Mobile Application Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15516v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Landscape architecture typically considers urban parks through the lens of form and function. While past research on equitable access has focused mainly on form, studies of functions have been constrained by limited scale and coarse measurement. Existing efforts have partially quantified functions through small-scale surveys and movement data (e.g., GPS) or general usage records (e.g., CDR), but have not captured the activities and motivations underlying park visits. As a result, our understanding of the functional roles urban parks play remains incomplete. To address this gap, we introduce a method that refines mobile base station coverage using antenna azimuths, enabling clearer distinction of mobile traffic within parks versus surrounding areas. Using Paris as a case study, we analyze a large-scale set of passively collected per-app mobile network traffic - 492 million hourly records for 45 parks. We test two hypotheses: the central-city hypothesis, which posits multifunctional parks emerge in dense, high-rent areas due to land scarcity; and the socio-spatial hypothesis, which views parks as reflections of neighborhood routines and preferences. Our analysis shows that parks have distinctive mobile traffic signatures, differing from both their surroundings and from each other. By clustering parks on temporal and app usage patterns, we identify three functional types - lunchbreak, cultural, and recreational - with different visitation motivations. Centrally located parks (cultural and lunchbreak) display more diverse app use and temporal variation, while suburban (recreational) parks reflect digital behaviors of nearby communities, with app preferences aligned to neighborhood income. These findings demonstrate the value of mobile traffic as a proxy for studying urban green space functions, with implications for park planning, public health, and well-being.</p></details> |  |

Lightweight models like MobileNet and EfficientNet, which utilize depthwise convolution for feature extraction, have been developed for these devices. However, CIM macros often face challenges in accelerating depthwise convolution, including underutilization of CIM memory and heavy buffer traffic. The latter, in particular, has been overlooked despite its significant impact on latency and energy consumption. To address this, we introduce a novel CIM dataflow that significantly reduces buffer traffic by maximizing data reuse and improving memory utilization during depthwise convolution. The proposed dataflow is grounded in solid theoretical principles, fully demonstrated in this paper. When applied to MobileNet and EfficientNet models, our dataflow reduces buffer traffic by 77.4-87.0%, leading to a total reduction in data traffic energy and latency by 10.1-17.9% and 15.6-27.8%, respectively, compared to the baseline (conventional weight-stationary dataflow).</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Computer Design</p></details> |

Adaptive routing faces two main challenges: 1) how to accurately measure/estimate time-varying traffic matrices? 2) how to control the network and application performance degradation caused by frequent route changes? In this paper, we develop a novel data-enabled predictive traffic engineering (DeeP-TE) algorithm that minimizes the network congestion by gracefully adapting routing configurations over time. Our control algorithm can generate routing updates directly from the historical routing data and the corresponding link rate data, without direct traffic matrix measurement or estimation. Numerical experiments on real network topologies with real traffic matrices demonstrate that the proposed DeeP-TE routing adaptation algorithm can achieve close-to-optimal control effectiveness with significantly lower routing variations than the baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models (VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Although Transformer-based models offer strong global modeling, they often struggle with rigid temporal encoding and weak space-time fusion. We propose STPFormer, a Spatio-Temporal Pattern-Aware Transformer that achieves state-of-the-art performance via unified and interpretable representation learning. It integrates four modules: Temporal Position Aggregator (TPA) for pattern-aware temporal encoding, Spatial Sequence Aggregator (SSA) for sequential spatial learning, Spatial-Temporal Graph Matching (STGM) for cross-domain alignment, and an Attention Mixer for multi-scale fusion. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that STPFormer consistently sets new SOTA results, with ablation and visualizations confirming its effectiveness and generalizability.</p></details> |  |

This study presents a decentralized, federated learning framework tailored for traffic sign detection in vehicular networks to enable collaborative model training without sharing raw data. The framework partitioned traffic sign classes across vehicles for specialized local training using lightweight object detectors, aggregated model parameters via algorithms like FedProx, FedAdam and FedAVG in a simulated environment with the Flower framework, and evaluated multiple configurations including varying server rounds, local epochs, client participation fractions, and data distributions. Experiments demonstrated that increasing server rounds from 2 to 20 boosted accuracy from below 0.1 to over 0.8, moderate local epochs (8-10) provided optimal efficiency with accuracies around 0.67, higher client participation fractions enhanced generalization up to 0.83, FedProx outperformed other aggregators in handling heterogeneity, non-IID data distributions reduced performance compared to IID, and training duration primarily scaled with the number of rounds rather than aggregation strategy. We conclude that this federated approach may offer a scalable, privacy-preserving solution for real-world vehicular deployments, potentially guiding future integrations of robust aggregation and communication optimizations to advance intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> | 7 pages, 10 figures |
| **[RIFT: Closed-Loop RL Fine-Tuning for Realistic and Controllable Traffic Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03344v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving both realism and controllability in closed-loop traffic simulation remains a key challenge in autonomous driving. Dataset-based methods reproduce realistic trajectories but suffer from covariate shift in closed-loop deployment, compounded by simplified dynamics models that further reduce reliability. Conversely, physics-based simulation methods enhance reliable and controllable closed-loop interactions but often lack expert demonstrations, compromising realism. To address these challenges, we introduce a dual-stage AV-centric simulation framework that conducts open-loop imitation learning pre-training in a data-driven simulator to capture trajectory-level realism and route-level controllability, followed by closed-loop reinforcement learning fine-tuning in a physics-based simulator to enhance style-level controllability and mitigate covariate shift. In the fine-tuning stage, we propose RIFT, a novel RL fine-tuning strategy that evaluates all candidate modalities through group-relative optimization with a dual-clip surrogate objective, enhancing style-level controllability and mitigating covariate shift, while preserving the trajectory-level realism and route-level controllability inherited from IL pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFT improves realism and controllability in traffic simulation while simultaneously exposing the limitations of modern AV systems in closed-loop evaluation.

| **[Physics-informed deep operator network for traffic state estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12593v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic state estimation (TSE) fundamentally involves solving high-dimensional spatiotemporal partial differential equations (PDEs) governing traffic flow dynamics from limited, noisy measurements. While Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) enforce PDE constraints point-wise, this paper adopts a physics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet) framework that reformulates TSE as an operator learning problem. Our approach trains a parameterized neural operator that maps sparse input data to the full spatiotemporal traffic state field, governed by the traffic flow conservation law. Crucially, unlike PINNs that enforce PDE constraints point-wise, PI-DeepONet integrates traffic flow conservation model and the fundamental diagram directly into the operator learning process, ensuring physical consistency while capturing congestion propagation, spatial correlations, and temporal evolution. Experiments on the NGSIM dataset demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines. Further analysis reveals insights into optimal function generation strategies and branch network complexity. Additionally, the impact of input function generation methods and the number of functions on model performance is explored, highlighting the robustness and efficacy of proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review in Transportmetrica B: Transport Dynamics</p></details> |

Observing unsolicited and erroneous traffic, such as unanswered traffic or errors, is fundamental to detect misconfiguration, temporary failures or attacks. ChamaleoNet transforms any production network into a transparent monitor to let administrators collect unsolicited and erroneous traffic directed to hosts, whether offline or active, hosting a server or a client, protected by a firewall, or unused addresses. ChamaleoNet is programmed to ignore well-formed traffic and collect only erroneous packets, including those generated by misconfigured or infected internal hosts, and those sent by external actors which scan for services. Engineering such a system poses several challenges, from scalability to privacy. Leveraging the SDN paradigm, ChamaleoNet processes the traffic flowing through a campus/corporate network and focuses on erroneous packets only, lowering the pressure on the collection system while respecting privacy regulations by design. ChamaleoNet enables the seamless integration with active deceptive systems like honeypots that can impersonate unused hosts/ports/services and engage with senders. The SDN in-hardware filtering reduces the traffic to the controller by 96%, resulting in a scalable solution, which we offer as open source. Simple analytics unveil internal misconfigured and infected hosts, identify temporary failures, and enhance visibility on external radiation produced by attackers looking for vulnerable services.</p></details> | 17 pages, 16 figures |

However, existing MLLMs in this domain primarily focus on coarse-grained image-level or video-level comprehension and often struggle to handle fine-grained visual details or localized scene components, limiting their applicability in complex accident scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose SafePLUG, a novel framework that empowers MLLMs with both Pixel-Level Understanding and temporal Grounding for comprehensive traffic accident analysis. SafePLUG supports both arbitrary-shaped visual prompts for region-aware question answering and pixel-level segmentation based on language instructions, while also enabling the recognition of temporally anchored events in traffic accident scenarios. To advance the development of MLLMs for traffic accident understanding, we curate a new dataset containing multimodal question-answer pairs centered on diverse accident scenarios, with detailed pixel-level annotations and temporal event boundaries. Experimental results show that SafePLUG achieves strong performance on multiple tasks, including region-based question answering, pixel-level segmentation, temporal event localization, and accident event understanding. These capabilities lay a foundation for fine-grained understanding of complex traffic scenes, with the potential to improve driving safety and enhance situational awareness in smart transportation systems.

As the number of signals increases, coordination becomes more challenging and traditional progression schemes tend to break down. Long progressions save travel time and fuel, reduce pollution and traffic accidents by providing a smoother flow of traffic. This paper introduces a green-wave theory that can be applied to a network of intersecting arterial roads. It enables uninterrupted flow on arbitrary long signalized arterials using a Road-to-Traveler-Feedback Device. The approach is modelled after Euclid. We define concepts such as RGW-roads (roads where vehicles traveling at the recommended speed make all traffic signals), green-arrows (representing vehicle platoons), real nodes (representing signalized intersections where RGW-roads intersect) and virtual nodes, green-wave speed, blocks, etc. - the analogue of Euclid's postulates. We then use geometric reasoning to deduce results: green-arrow lengths have a maximum value, are restricted to discrete lengths, and green-arrow laws of motion imply that select existing arterial roads can be converted to RGW-roads. The signal timings and offsets that are produced have been shown to be effective using a simulation model developed previously called RGW-SIM.</p></details> | 74 pages, 49 figures |
| **[Scale-Disentangled spatiotemporal Modeling for Long-term Traffic Emission Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11923v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term traffic emission forecasting is crucial for the comprehensive management of urban air pollution. Traditional forecasting methods typically construct spatiotemporal graph models by mining spatiotemporal dependencies to predict emissions. However, due to the multi-scale entanglement of traffic emissions across time and space, these spatiotemporal graph modeling method tend to suffer from cascading error amplification during long-term inference. To address this issue, we propose a Scale-Disentangled Spatio-Temporal Modeling (SDSTM) framework for long-term traffic emission forecasting. It leverages the predictability differences across multiple scales to decompose and fuse features at different scales, while constraining them to remain independent yet complementary. Specifically, the model first introduces a dual-stream feature decomposition strategy based on the Koopman lifting operator. It lifts the scale-coupled spatiotemporal dynamical system into an infinite-dimensional linear space via Koopman operator, and delineates the predictability boundary using gated wavelet decomposition. Then a novel fusion mechanism is constructed, incorporating a dual-stream independence constraint based on cross-term loss to dynamically refine the dual-stream prediction results, suppress mutual interference, and enhance the accuracy of long-term traffic emission prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on a road-level traffic emission dataset within Xi'an's Second Ring Road demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces a curated dataset of more than 3 million people involved in accidents in Ohio over six years (2017-2022), aggregated to more than 2.3 million vehicle-level records for predictive analysis. The primary contribution is a transparent and reproducible methodology that combines Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and explainable artificial intelligence (AI) to identify and interpret key risk factors associated with severe crashes. Using the JADBio AutoML platform, predictive models were constructed to distinguish between severe and non-severe crash outcomes. The models underwent rigorous feature selection across stratified training subsets, and their outputs were interpreted using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to quantify the contribution of individual features. A final Ridge Logistic Regression model achieved an AUC-ROC of 85.6% on the training set and 84.9% on a hold-out test set, with 17 features consistently identified as the most influential predictors. Key features spanned demographic, environmental, vehicle, human, and operational categories, including location type, posted speed, minimum occupant age, and pre-crash action. Notably, certain traditionally emphasized factors, such as alcohol or drug impairment, were less influential in the final model compared to environmental and contextual variables. Emphasizing methodological rigor and interpretability over mere predictive performance, this study offers a scalable framework to support Vision Zero with aligned interventions and advanced data-informed traffic safety policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

To address this, we introduce a novel, end-to-end approach, $\texttt{AirTrafficGen}$, that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate and control the generation of complex ATC scenarios. Our method uses a purpose-built, graph-based representation to encode sector topology (including airspace geometry, routes, and fixes) into a format LLMs can process. Through rigorous benchmarking, we show that state-of-the-art models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, OpenAI o3, GPT-oss-120b and GPT-5 can generate high-traffic scenarios while maintaining operational realism. Our engineered prompting enables fine-grained control over interaction presence, type, and location. Initial findings suggest these models are also capable of iterative refinement, correcting flawed scenarios based on simple textual feedback. This approach provides a scalable alternative to manual scenario design, addressing the need for a greater volume and variety of ATC training and validation simulations. More broadly, this work showcases the potential of LLMs for complex planning in safety-critical domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages and appendices</p></details> |

However, the realism of a simulation depends extensively on the quality of input data. This paper presents an intersection traffic simulation tool that leverages real-world vehicle turning movement count (TMC) data from the City of Toronto to model traffic in an urban environment at an individual or multiple intersections using Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO). The simulation performed in this research focuses specifically on intersection-level traffic generation without creating full vehicle routes through the network. This also helps keep the network's complexity to a minimum. The simulated traffic is evaluated against actual data to show that the simulation closely reproduces real intersection flows. This validates that the real data can drive practical simulations, and these scenarios can replace synthetic or random generated data, which is prominently used in developing new traffic-related methodologies. This is the first tool to integrate TMC data from Toronto into SUMO via an easy-to-use Graphical User Interface. This work contributes to the research and traffic planning community on data-driven traffic simulation. It provides transportation engineers with a framework to evaluate intersection design and traffic signal optimization strategies using readily available aggregate traffic data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2025 21st DCOSS-IoT, Code is available at Github: https://github.com/ANTS-OntarioTechU/CrossFlow</p></details> |

To address this, we integrate a bio-inspired event camera with an RGB camera to provide high dynamic range information and propose a motion cue fusion network (MCFNet), which achieves optimal spatiotemporal alignment and adaptive cross-modal feature fusion under challenging lighting. Specifically, an event correction module (ECM) temporally aligns asynchronous event streams with image frames via optical-flow-based warping, jointly optimized with the detection network to learn task-aware event representations. The event dynamic upsampling module (EDUM) enhances spatial resolution of event frames to match image structures, ensuring precise spatiotemporal alignment. The cross-modal mamba fusion module (CMM) uses adaptive feature fusion with a novel interlaced scanning mechanism, effectively integrating complementary information for robust detection. Experiments conducted on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate that MCFNet significantly outperforms existing methods in various poor lighting and fast moving traffic scenarios. Notably, on the DSEC-Det dataset, MCFNet achieves a remarkable improvement, surpassing the best existing methods by 7.4% in mAP50 and 1.7% in mAP metrics, respectively.

Participants completed six driving scenarios that combined two levels of cognitive distraction (with/without mental calculations) and three levels of driving environment complexity. Throughout the experiment, participants were free to activate or deactivate an ACC. We analyzed two gaze-based indicators of driver cognitive distraction: the percent road center, and the gaze dispersions (horizontal and vertical). Our results show that vertical gaze dispersion increases with traffic complexity, while ACC use leads to gaze concentration toward the road center. Cognitive distraction reduces road center gaze and increases vertical dispersion. Complementary analyses revealed that these observations actually arise mainly between mental calculations, while periods of mental calculations are characterized by a temporary increase in gaze concentration.</p></details> |  |

Participants drove in six scenarios, combining two levels of cognitive distraction (presence/absence of a mental calculation task) and three levels of driving environment complexity (different traffic conditions). Throughout the experiment, they were free to activate or deactivate ACC (ACC use, two levels). We analyzed three EDA-based indicators of cognitive distraction: SCL (mean skin conductance level), SCR amplitude (mean amplitude of skin conductance responses), and SCR rate (rate of skin conductance responses). Results indicate that all three indicators were significantly influenced by cognitive distraction and ACC use, while environment complexity influenced SCL and SCR amplitude, but not SCR rate. These findings suggest that EDA-based indicators reflect variations in drivers' mental workload due not only to cognitive distraction, but also to driving environment and automation use.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Retrieval Augmented Spatio-Temporal Framework for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16623v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic prediction is a cornerstone of modern intelligent transportation systems and a critical task in spatio-temporal forecasting. Although advanced Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) and pre-trained models have achieved significant progress in traffic prediction, two key challenges remain: (i) limited contextual capacity when modeling complex spatio-temporal dependencies, and (ii) low predictability at fine-grained spatio-temporal points due to heterogeneous patterns. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we propose RAST, a universal framework that integrates retrieval-augmented mechanisms with spatio-temporal modeling to address these challenges. Our framework consists of three key designs: 1) Decoupled Encoder and Query Generator to capture decoupled spatial and temporal features and construct a fusion query via residual fusion; 2) Spatio-temporal Retrieval Store and Retrievers to maintain and retrieve vectorized fine-grained patterns; and 3) Universal Backbone Predictor that flexibly accommodates pre-trained STGNNs or simple MLP predictors. Extensive experiments on six real-world traffic networks, including large-scale datasets, demonstrate that RAST achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[M3-Net: A Cost-Effective Graph-Free MLP-Based Model for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08543v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving accurate traffic prediction is a fundamental but crucial task in the development of current intelligent transportation systems.Most of the mainstream methods that have made breakthroughs in traffic prediction rely on spatio-temporal graph neural networks, spatio-temporal attention mechanisms, etc. The main challenges of the existing deep learning approaches are that they either depend on a complete traffic network structure or require intricate model designs to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. These limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction performance and lightweight deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Metering traffic flows for perimeter control through auction-based signalling using connected vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09678v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban traffic congestion remains a critical challenge in modern cities, with traffic signal control systems often struggling to manage congestion during peak travel times. Perimeter control of a Protected Network (PN) has emerged as a potential solution to reducing gridlock in urban networks. This paper proposes a novel auction-based mechanism for green time allocation at signalized intersections, for effective perimeter control application. Utilising a Sealed Bid, Second Price auction framework, our approach combines real-time traffic monitoring with market-inspired mechanisms to regulate vehicle inflows into PN areas. Unlike existing methods that focus primarily on gated links, our system allocates budgets to individual traffic movements, providing greater flexibility in managing multi-directional flows. We evaluate the proposed mechanism using a test case intersection with a single controlled inflow, comparing it against a volume-based fixed-time approach. The results demonstrate that our auction-based method controls flows into the PN with improved accuracy, outperforming the volume-based approach in terms of inflow regulation, queue management and delays. The framework can be applied in real time to any generic intersection, offering a scalable solution for urban traffic management. This work bridges the gap between perimeter control and market-based intersection auctions, providing a pathway for further research on adaptive traffic management systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluation of Bio-Inspired Models under Different Learning Settings For Energy Efficiency in Network Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17565v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cellular traffic forecasting is a critical task that enables network operators to efficiently allocate resources and address anomalies in rapidly evolving environments. The exponential growth of data collected from base stations poses significant challenges to processing and analysis. While machine learning (ML) algorithms have emerged as powerful tools for handling these large datasets and providing accurate predictions, their environmental impact, particularly in terms of energy consumption, is often overlooked in favor of their predictive capabilities. This study investigates the potential of two bio-inspired models: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Reservoir Computing through Echo State Networks (ESNs) for cellular traffic forecasting. The evaluation focuses on both their predictive performance and energy efficiency. These models are implemented in both centralized and federated settings to analyze their effectiveness and energy consumption in decentralized systems. Additionally, we compare bio-inspired models with traditional architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), to provide a comprehensive evaluation. Using data collected from three diverse locations in Barcelona, Spain, we examine the trade-offs between predictive accuracy and energy demands across these approaches. The results indicate that bio-inspired models, such as SNNs and ESNs, can achieve significant energy savings while maintaining predictive accuracy comparable to traditional architectures. Furthermore, federated implementations were tested to evaluate their energy efficiency in decentralized settings compared to centralized systems, particularly in combination with bio-inspired models. These findings offer valuable insights into the potential of bio-inspired models for sustainable and privacy-preserving cellular traffic forecasting.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

This study addresses binary VPN detection, distinguishing VPN-encrypted from non-VPN traffic using wavelet transform-based features across multiple machine learning models. Unlike previous studies focused on application-level classification within encrypted traffic, we specifically evaluate the fundamental task of VPN identification regardless of application type. We analyze the impact of wavelet decomposition levels and dataset filtering on classification performance across significantly imbalanced data, where filtering reduces some traffic categories by up to 95%. Our results demonstrate that Random Forest (RF) achieves superior performance with an F1-score of 99%, maintaining robust accuracy even after significant dataset filtering. Neural Networks (NN) show comparable effectiveness with an F1-score of 98% when trained on wavelet level 12, while Support Vector Machines (SVM) exhibit notable sensitivity to dataset reduction, with F1-scores dropping from 90% to 85% after filtering. Comparing wavelet decomposition at levels 5 and 12, we observe improved classification performance at level 12, particularly for variable traffic types, though the marginal gains may not justify the additional computational overhead. These findings establish RF as the most reliable model for VPN traffic classification while highlighting key performance tradeoffs in feature extraction and preprocessing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at SoftCOM 2025</p></details> |

Focusing resources on the causes of congestion is a potentially efficient strategy for reducing slowdowns. We present NEXICA, an algorithm to discover which parts of the highway system tend to cause slowdowns on other parts of the highway. We use time series of road speeds as inputs to our causal discovery algorithm. Finding other algorithms inadequate, we develop a new approach that is novel in three ways. First, it concentrates on just the presence or absence of events in the time series, where an event indicates the temporal beginning of a traffic slowdown. Second, we develop a probabilistic model using maximum likelihood estimation to compute the probabilities of spontaneous and caused slowdowns between two locations on the highway. Third, we train a binary classifier to identify pairs of cause/effect locations trained on pairs of road locations where we are reasonably certain a priori of their causal connections, both positive and negative. We test our approach on six months of road speed data from 195 different highway speed sensors in the Los Angeles area, showing that our approach is superior to state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and computation speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of short paper in 32nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems (ACM SIGSPATIAL 2024)</p></details> |
| **[From Micro to Macro Flow Modeling: Characterizing Heterogeneity of Mixed-Autonomy Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09432v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most autonomous-vehicles (AVs) driving strategies are designed and analyzed at the vehicle level, yet their aggregate impact on macroscopic traffic flow is still not understood, particularly the flow heterogeneity that emerges when AVs interact with human-driven vehicles (HVs). Existing validation techniques for macroscopic flow models rely on high-resolution spatiotemporal data spanning entire road segments which are rarely available for mixed-autonomy traffic. AVs record detailed Lagrangian trajectories of the ego vehicle and surrounding traffic through onboard sensors. Leveraging these Lagrangian observations to validate mixed-autonomy flow models therefore remains an open research challenge. This paper closes the gap between microscopic Lagrangian data and macroscopic Euclidean traffic models by introducing a continuous traffic-heterogeneity attribute. We represent traffic flow with two coupled conservation laws with one for vehicle number and one for the traffic attribute. Reconstruction methods are designed to derive the traffic attribute from Lagrangian vehicle trajectories. When abundant trajectory data are available, we characterize traffic heterogeneity by extracting drivers' desired speed and local behavioral uncertainty from trajectories. In data-scarce mixed traffic, we design an end-to-end mapping that infers the traffic heterogeneity solely from trajectories in the current spatiotemporal region. Experiments across multiple traffic datasets show that the proposed model effectively captures traffic heterogeneity by clustering the fundamental diagram scatter into attribute-based groups. The calibration errors of traffic flow dynamics are also reduce by 20% relative to the Aw-Rascle-Zhang model benchmark. Detailed analyses further show that the model generalizes well, maintaining nearly the same accuracy when evaluated under a variety of previously unseen traffic conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Carbon Pricing in Traffic Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09280v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic is a significant source of global carbon emissions. In this paper, we study how carbon pricing can be used to guide traffic towards equilibria that respect given emission budgets. In particular, we consider a general multi-commodity flow model with flow-dependent externalities. These externalities may represent carbon emissions, entering a priced area, or the traversal of paths regulated by tradable credit schemes. We provide a complete characterization of all flows that can be attained as Wardrop equilibria when assigning a single price to each externality. More precisely, we show that every externality budget achievable by any feasible flow in the network can also be achieved as a Wardrop equilibrium by setting appropriate prices. For extremal and Pareto-minimal budgets, we show that there are prices such that all equilibria respect the budgets. Although the proofs of existence of these particular prices rely on fixed-point arguments and are non-constructive, we show that in the case where the equilibrium minimizes a convex potential, the prices can be obtained as Lagrange multipliers of a suitable convex program. In the case of a single externality, we prove that the total externality caused by the traffic flow is decreasing in the price. For increasing, continuous, and piecewise affine travel time functions with a single externality, we give an output-polynomial algorithm that computes all equilibria implementable by pricing the externality. Even though there are networks where the output size is exponential in the input size, we show that the minimal price obeying a given budget can be computed in polynomial time. This allows the efficient computation of the market price of tradable credit schemes. Overall, our results show that carbon pricing is a viable and (under mild assumptions) tractable approach to achieve all feasible emission goals in traffic networks.</p></details> | 29 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Generalising Traffic Forecasting to Regions without Traffic Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08947v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation systems. Accurate forecasting relies on continuous observations collected by traffic sensors. However, due to high deployment and maintenance costs, not all regions are equipped with such sensors. This paper aims to forecast for regions without traffic sensors, where the lack of historical traffic observations challenges the generalisability of existing models. We propose a model named GenCast, the core idea of which is to exploit external knowledge to compensate for the missing observations and to enhance generalisation. We integrate physics-informed neural networks into GenCast, enabling physical principles to regularise the learning process. We introduce an external signal learning module to explore correlations between traffic states and external signals such as weather conditions, further improving model generalisability. Additionally, we design a spatial grouping module to filter localised features that hinder model generalisability. Extensive experiments show that GenCast consistently reduces forecasting errors on multiple real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety Perspective on Assisted Lane Changes: Insights from Open-Road, Live-Traffic Experiments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09233v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the assisted lane change functionality of five different vehicles equipped with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). The goal is to examine novel, under-researched features of commercially available ADAS technologies. The experimental campaign, conducted in the I-24 highway near Nashville, TN, US, collected data on the kinematics and safety margins of assisted lane changes in real-world conditions. The results show that the kinematics of assisted lane changes are consistent for each system, with four out of five vehicles using slower speeds and decelerations than human drivers. However, one system consistently performed more assertive lane changes, completing the maneuver in around 5 seconds. Regarding safety margins, only three vehicles are investigated. Those operated in the US are not restricted by relevant UN regulations, and their designs were found not to adhere to these regulatory requirements. A simulation method used to classify the challenge level for the vehicle receiving the lane change, showing that these systems can force trailing vehicles to decelerate to keep a safe gap. One assisted system was found to have performed a maneuver that posed a hard challenge level for the other vehicle, raising concerns about the safety of these systems in real-world operation. All three vehicles were found to carry out lane changes that induced decelerations to the vehicle in the target lane. Those decelerations could affect traffic flow, inducing traffic shockwaves.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 Figures |

The recent success of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs raises the question of how to deploy them efficiently, considering their underlying structure. During the inference in MoE LLMs, only a small part of the experts is selected to process a given token. Moreover, in practice, the experts' load is highly imbalanced. For efficient deployment, one has to distribute the model across a large number of servers using a model placement algorithm. Thus, to improve cluster utilization, the model placement algorithm has to take into account the network topology. This work focuses on the efficient topology-aware placement of the pre-trained MoE LLMs in the inference stage. We propose an integer linear program (ILP) that determines the optimal placement of experts, minimizing the expected number of transmissions. Due to the internal structure, this optimization problem can be solved with a standard ILP solver. We demonstrate that ILP-based placement strategy yields lower network traffic than competitors for small-scale (DeepSeekMoE~16B) and large-scale (DeepSeek-R1~671B) models.</p></details> |  |

However, jointly controlling both in real-time to alleviate traffic congestion presents new challenges, such as the inherent physical and behavioral heterogeneity between signal control and platooning, as well as coordination between them. This paper proposes an innovative solution to tackle these challenges based on heterogeneous graph multi-agent reinforcement learning and traffic theories. Our approach involves: 1) designing platoon and signal control as distinct reinforcement learning agents with their own set of observations, actions, and reward functions to optimize traffic flow; 2) designing coordination by incorporating graph neural networks within multi-agent reinforcement learning to facilitate seamless information exchange among agents on a regional scale; 3) applying alternating optimization for training, allowing agents to update their own policies and adapt to other agents' policies. We evaluate our approach through SUMO simulations, which show convergent results in terms of both travel time and fuel consumption, and superior performance compared to other adaptive signal control methods.</p></details> |  |

However, it encounters significant challenges including harsh communication environments, limited energy supply, and restricted signal transmission. This paper aims to provide efficient and reliable communication in underwater networks with limited energy and communication resources by optimizing the scheduling of communication links and adjusting transmission parameters (e.g., transmit power and transmission rate). The efficient and reliable communication multi-objective optimization problem (ERCMOP) is formulated as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP). A Traffic Load-Aware Resource Management (TARM) strategy based on deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is presented to address this problem. Specifically, a traffic load-aware mechanism that leverages the overhear information from neighboring nodes is designed to mitigate the disparity between partial observations and global states. Moreover, by incorporating a solution space optimization algorithm, the number of candidate solutions for the deep MARL-based decision-making model can be effectively reduced, thereby optimizing the computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the adaptability of TARM in various scenarios with different transmission demands and collision probabilities, while also validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in supporting efficient and reliable communication in underwater networks with limited resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</p></details> |

One crucial step is modeling the volume of traffic demand. But past demand modeling approaches have relied on unrealistic or suboptimal heuristics, and they have failed to adequately account for the effects of noisy and multimodal data on simulation outcomes. In this work, we integrate advances in AI to construct a three-step, end-to-end pipeline for systematically modeling traffic demand from detector data: computer vision for vehicle counting from noisy camera footage, combinatorial optimization for vehicle route generation from multimodal data, and large language models for iterative simulation refinement from natural language feedback. Using a road network from Strongsville, Ohio as a testbed, we show that our pipeline accurately captures the city's traffic patterns in a granular simulation. Beyond Strongsville, incorporating noise and multimodality makes our framework generalizable to municipalities with different levels of data and infrastructure availability.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages; 1 table; 6 figures; extended version of accepted version, published at the 2025 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC '25)</p></details> |
| **[A Physics-informed Deep Operator for Real-Time Freeway Traffic State Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08002v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic state estimation (TSE) falls methodologically into three categories: model-driven, data-driven, and model-data dual-driven. Model-driven TSE relies on macroscopic traffic flow models originated from hydrodynamics. Data-driven TSE leverages historical sensing data and employs statistical models or machine learning methods to infer traffic state. Model-data dual-driven traffic state estimation attempts to harness the strengths of both aspects to achieve more accurate TSE. From the perspective of mathematical operator theory, TSE can be viewed as a type of operator that maps available measurements of inerested traffic state into unmeasured traffic state variables in real time. For the first time this paper proposes to study real-time freeway TSE in the idea of physics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet), which is an operator-oriented architecture embedding traffic flow models based on deep neural networks. The paper has developed an extended architecture from the original PI-DeepONet. The extended architecture is featured with: (1) the acceptance of 2-D data input so as to support CNN-based computations; (2) the introduction of a nonlinear expansion layer, an attention mechanism, and a MIMO mechanism; (3) dedicated neural network design for adaptive identification of traffic flow model parameters. A traffic state estimator built on the basis of this extended PI-DeepONet architecture was evaluated with respect to a short freeway stretch of NGSIM and a large-scale urban expressway in China, along with other four baseline TSE methods. The evaluation results demonstrated that this novel TSE method outperformed the baseline methods with high-precision estimation results of flow and mean speed.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Noise-Aware Generative Microscopic Traffic Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07453v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately modeling individual vehicle behavior in microscopic traffic simulation remains a key challenge in intelligent transportation systems, as it requires vehicles to realistically generate and respond to complex traffic phenomena such as phantom traffic jams. While traditional human driver simulation models offer computational tractability, they do so by abstracting away the very complexity that defines human driving. On the other hand, recent advances in infrastructure-mounted camera-based roadway sensing have enabled the extraction of vehicle trajectory data, presenting an opportunity to shift toward generative, agent-based models. Yet, a major bottleneck remains: most existing datasets are either overly sanitized or lack standardization, failing to reflect the noisy, imperfect nature of real-world sensing. Unlike data from vehicle-mounted sensors-which can mitigate sensing artifacts like occlusion through overlapping fields of view and sensor fusion-infrastructure-based sensors surface a messier, more practical view of challenges that traffic engineers encounter. To this end, we present the I-24 MOTION Scenario Dataset (I24-MSD)-a standardized, curated dataset designed to preserve a realistic level of sensor imperfection, embracing these errors as part of the learning problem rather than an obstacle to overcome purely from preprocessing. Drawing from noise-aware learning strategies in computer vision, we further adapt existing generative models in the autonomous driving community for I24-MSD with noise-aware loss functions. Our results show that such models not only outperform traditional baselines in realism but also benefit from explicitly engaging with, rather than suppressing, data imperfection. We view I24-MSD as a stepping stone toward a new generation of microscopic traffic simulation that embraces the real-world challenges and is better aligned with practical needs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Traffic Oscillations in Mixed Traffic Flow with Scalable Deep Koopman Predictive Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00043v3)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mitigating traffic oscillations in mixed flows of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) is critical for enhancing traffic stability. A key challenge lies in modeling the nonlinear, heterogeneous behaviors of HDVs within computationally tractable predictive control frameworks. This study proposes an adaptive deep Koopman predictive control framework (AdapKoopPC) to address this issue. The framework features a novel deep Koopman network, AdapKoopnet, which represents complex HDV car-following dynamics as a linear system in a high-dimensional space by adaptively learning from naturalistic data. This learned linear representation is then embedded into a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme, enabling real-time, scalable, and optimal control of CAVs. We validate our framework using the HighD dataset and extensive numerical simulations. Results demonstrate that AdapKoopnet achieves superior trajectory prediction accuracy over baseline models. Furthermore, the complete AdapKoopPC controller significantly dampens traffic oscillations with lower computational cost, exhibiting strong performance even at low CAV penetration rates. The proposed framework offers a scalable and data-driven solution for enhancing stability in realistic mixed traffic environments. The code is made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Competition Helps: Achieving Optimal Traffic Flow with Multiple Autonomous Planners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07145v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inefficiency of selfish routing in congested networks is a classical problem in algorithmic game theory, often captured by the Price of Anarchy (i.e., the ratio between the social cost of decentralized decisions and that of a centrally optimized solution.) With the advent of autonomous vehicles, capable of receiving and executing centrally assigned routes, it is natural to ask whether their deployment can eliminate this inefficiency. At first glance, a central authority could simply compute an optimal traffic assignment and instruct each vehicle to follow its assigned path. However, this vision overlooks critical challenges: routes must be individually rational (no vehicle has an incentive to deviate), and in practice, multiple planning agents (e.g., different companies) may coexist and compete. Surprisingly, we show that such competition is not merely an obstacle but a necessary ingredient for achieving optimal outcomes. In this work, we design a routing mechanism that embraces competition and converges to an optimal assignment, starting from the classical Pigou network as a foundational case.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models are often task-oriented and are trained with tailored data, which limits their effectiveness in diverse mobile network tasks of Base Station (BS) deployment, resource allocation, energy optimization, etc. and hinders generalization across different urban environments. Foundation models have made remarkable strides across various domains of NLP and CV due to their multi-tasking adaption and zero/few-shot learning capabilities. In this paper, we propose an innovative Foundation model for Mo}bile traffic forecasting (FoMo), aiming to handle diverse forecasting tasks of short/long-term predictions and distribution generation across multiple cities to support network planning and optimization. FoMo combines diffusion models and transformers, where various spatio-temporal masks are proposed to enable FoMo to learn intrinsic features of different tasks, and a contrastive learning strategy is developed to capture the correlations between mobile traffic and urban contexts, thereby improving its transfer learning capability.

While Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have shown benefits in modeling complex traffic dependencies, the existing GCN-based approaches cannot fully extract and fuse multi-granular spatiotemporal features across various spatial and temporal scales sufficiently in a complete manner, proven to yield less accurate results. Besides, as extracting multi-granular features across scales has been a promising strategy across domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, and time-series forecasting, pioneering studies have attempted to leverage a similar mechanism for spatiotemporal traffic data mining. However, additional feature extraction branches introduced in prior studies critically increased model complexity and extended inference time, making it challenging to provide fast forecasts. In this paper, we propose MultiGran-STGCNFog, an efficient fog distributed inference system with a novel traffic forecasting model that employs multi-granular spatiotemporal feature fusion on generated dynamic traffic graphs to fully capture interdependent traffic dynamics. The proposed scheduling algorithm GA-DPHDS, optimizing layer execution order and layer-device scheduling scheme simultaneously, contributes to considerable inference throughput improvement by coordinating heterogeneous fog devices in a pipelined manner.

An advertising campaign hopes to maximize the effect (such as conversions) under constraints (such as budget and cost-per-click). The mainstream control of campaigns is auto-bidding, where the performance depends on the decision of the bidding algorithm in each request. The most widely used auto-bidding algorithms include Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control, linear programming (LP), reinforcement learning (RL), etc. Existing methods either do not consider the entire time traffic, or have too high computational complexity. In this paper, the live advertising has high requirements for real-time bidding (second-level control) and faces the difficulty of unknown future traffic. Therefore, we propose a lightweight bidding algorithm Binary Constrained Bidding (BiCB), which neatly combines the optimal bidding formula given by mathematical analysis and the statistical method of future traffic estimation, and obtains good approximation to the optimal result through a low complexity solution. In addition, we complement the form of upper and lower bound constraints for traditional auto-bidding modeling and give theoretical analysis of BiCB. Sufficient offline and online experiments prove BiCB's good performance and low engineering cost.</p></details> |  |

Existing work either assumes all locations are equipped with sensors or focuses on short-term forecast. This paper studies partial sensing forecast of long-term traffic, assuming sensors are available only at some locations. The problem is challenging due to the unknown data distribution at unsensed locations, the intricate spatio-temporal correlation in long-term forecasting, as well as noise to traffic patterns. We propose a Spatio-temporal Long-term Partial sensing Forecast model (SLPF) for traffic prediction, with several novel contributions, including a rank-based embedding technique to reduce the impact of noise in data, a spatial transfer matrix to overcome the spatial distribution shift from sensed locations to unsensed locations, and a multi-step training process that utilizes all available data to successively refine the model parameters for better accuracy.

However, accurate forecasting is difficult due to intricate spatial and temporal patterns that exist due to the mobility of users. Existing AI-based traffic forecasting models often trade-off accuracy and computational efficiency. We present Hierarchical SpatioTemporal Mamba (HiSTM), which combines a dual spatial encoder with a Mamba-based temporal module and attention mechanism. HiSTM employs selective state space methods to capture spatial and temporal patterns in network traffic. In our evaluation, we use a real-world dataset to compare HiSTM against several baselines, showing a 29.4% MAE improvement over the STN baseline while using 94% fewer parameters. We show that the HiSTM generalizes well across different datasets and improves in accuracy over longer time-horizons.</p></details> |  |
| **[Channel-Independent Federated Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04517v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, traffic prediction has achieved remarkable success and has become an integral component of intelligent transportation systems. However, traffic data is typically distributed among multiple data owners, and privacy constraints prevent the direct utilization of these isolated datasets for traffic prediction. Most existing federated traffic prediction methods focus on designing communication mechanisms that allow models to leverage information from other clients in order to improve prediction accuracy. Unfortunately, such approaches often incur substantial communication overhead, and the resulting transmission delays significantly slow down the training process. As the volume of traffic data continues to grow, this issue becomes increasingly critical, making the resource consumption of current methods unsustainable. To address this challenge, we propose a novel variable relationship modeling paradigm for federated traffic prediction, termed the Channel-Independent Paradigm(CIP). Unlike traditional approaches, CIP eliminates the need for inter-client communication by enabling each node to perform efficient and accurate predictions using only local information. Based on the CIP, we further develop Fed-CI, an efficient federated learning framework, allowing each client to process its own data independently while effectively mitigating the information loss caused by the lack of direct data sharing among clients. Fed-CI significantly reduces communication overhead, accelerates the training process, and achieves state-of-the-art performance while complying with privacy regulations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that Fed-CI consistently outperforms existing methods across all datasets and federated settings.

| **[Reconstructing Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Traffic Flow Modeling: a Multi-Gradient Descent and Pareto Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13241v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is crucial in modern traffic flow modeling because it combines the benefits of both physics-based and data-driven approaches. In conventional PIML, physical information is typically incorporated by constructing a hybrid loss function that combines data-driven loss and physics loss through linear scalarization. The goal is to find a trade-off between these two objectives to improve the accuracy of model predictions. However, from a mathematical perspective, linear scalarization is limited to identifying only the convex region of the Pareto front, as it treats data-driven and physics losses as separate objectives. Given that most PIML loss functions are non-convex, linear scalarization restricts the achievable trade-off solutions. Moreover, tuning the weighting coefficients for the two loss components can be both time-consuming and computationally challenging. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a paradigm shift in PIML by reformulating the training process as a multi-objective optimization problem, treating data-driven loss and physics loss independently. We apply several multi-gradient descent algorithms (MGDAs), including traditional multi-gradient descent (TMGD) and dual cone gradient descent (DCGD), to explore the Pareto front in this multi-objective setting. These methods are evaluated on both macroscopic and microscopic traffic flow models. In the macroscopic case, MGDAs achieved comparable performance to traditional linear scalarization methods. Notably, in the microscopic case, MGDAs significantly outperformed their scalarization-based counterparts, demonstrating the advantages of a multi-objective optimization approach in complex PIML scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Given the prohibitive computational cost of learning individual policies for each intersection, some researchers explore learning a universal policy to control each intersection in a decentralized manner, where the key challenge is to construct a universal representation method for heterogeneous intersections. However, existing methods are limited to universally representing information of heterogeneous ego intersections, neglecting the essential representation of influence from their heterogeneous neighbors. Universally incorporating neighborhood information is nontrivial due to the intrinsic complexity of traffic flow interactions, as well as the challenge of modeling collective influences from neighbor intersections. To address these challenges, we propose CityLight, which learns a universal policy based on representations obtained with two major modules: a Neighbor Influence Encoder to explicitly model neighbor's influence with specified traffic flow relation and connectivity to the ego intersection; a Neighbor Influence Aggregator to attentively aggregate the influence of neighbors based on their mutual competitive relations. Extensive experiments on five city-scale datasets, ranging from 97 to 13,952 intersections, confirm the efficacy of CityLight, with an average throughput improvement of 11.68% and a lift of 22.59% for generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |

Prior models and benchmarks focus on closed-loop motion simulation for initial agents in a scene. This is problematic for long-term simulation. Agents enter and exit the scene as the ego vehicle enters new regions. We propose InfGen, a unified next-token prediction model that performs interleaved closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation. InfGen automatically switches between closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation mode. It enables stable long-term rollout simulation. InfGen performs at the state-of-the-art in short-term (9s) traffic simulation, and significantly outperforms all other methods in long-term (30s) simulation.

While classical approaches such as Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) remain widely used, they often fail to capture the spatial dependencies inherent in energy networks. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a principled framework to incorporate this structure by directly leveraging graph topologies. In this work, we evaluate a broad set of GNN architectures -- including GCN, GraphSAGE, ChebConv, TAG, APPNP, TransformerConv, and Graph Attention Networks (GAT and GATv2) -- on two real-world electricity consumption datasets from France and the UK. Our results show that simpler models such as GCN, SAGE, or APPNP often outperform more complex alternatives in low-data regimes, while GAT ranks among the strongest architectures in our benchmarks, combining high accuracy with valuable interpretability. We perform a temporal analysis of attention weights, revealing evolving patterns of regional interaction linked to seasonal and meteorological variability. These results highlight that, although attention is not universally superior, it provides valuable explanatory power when spatial dependencies are prominent. Additionally, we demonstrate that ensemble-based expert aggregation strategies, particularly bottom-up combinations, significantly improve robustness and yield state-of-the-art performance across both datasets. These findings highlight the dual promise of GNNs for accurate and interpretable forecasting, and suggest that architectural simplicity coupled with ensemble methods can provide a practical path forward for transparent energy analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, ECML PKDD 2025 Workshop paper</p></details> |

We introduce Topotein, a comprehensive framework that applies topological deep learning to PRL through the novel Protein Combinatorial Complex (PCC) and Topology-Complete Perceptron Network (TCPNet). Our PCC represents proteins at multiple hierarchical levels -- from residues to secondary structures to complete proteins -- while preserving geometric information at each level. TCPNet employs SE(3)-equivariant message passing across these hierarchical structures, enabling more effective capture of multi-scale structural patterns. Through extensive experiments on four PRL tasks, TCPNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art geometric graph neural networks. Our approach demonstrates particular strength in tasks such as fold classification which require understanding of secondary structure arrangements, validating the importance of hierarchical topological features for protein analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[EZhouNet:A framework based on graph neural network and anchor interval for the respiratory sound event detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01153v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auscultation is a key method for early diagnosis of respiratory and pulmonary diseases, relying on skilled healthcare professionals. However, the process is often subjective, with variability between experts. As a result, numerous deep learning-based automatic classification methods have emerged, most of which focus on respiratory sound classification. In contrast, research on respiratory sound event detection remains limited. Existing sound event detection methods typically rely on frame-level predictions followed by post-processing to generate event-level outputs, making interval boundaries challenging to learn directly. Furthermore, many approaches can only handle fixed-length audio, limiting their applicability to variable-length respiratory sounds. Additionally, the impact of respiratory sound location information on detection performance has not been extensively explored. To address these issues, we propose a graph neural network-based framework with anchor intervals, capable of handling variable-length audio and providing more precise temporal localization for abnormal respiratory sound events. Our method improves both the flexibility and applicability of respiratory sound detection. Experiments on the SPRSound 2024 and HF Lung V1 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and incorporating respiratory position information enhances the discrimination between abnormal sounds. The reference implementation is available at https://github.com/chumingqian/EzhouNet.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph neural networks for learning liquid simulations in dynamic scenes containing kinematic objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03446v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating particle dynamics with high fidelity is crucial for solving real-world interaction and control tasks involving liquids in design, graphics, and robotics. Recently, data-driven approaches, particularly those based on graph neural networks (GNNs), have shown progress in tackling such problems. However, these approaches are often limited to learning fluid behavior in static free-fall environments or simple manipulation settings involving primitive objects, often overlooking complex interactions with dynamically moving kinematic rigid bodies. Here, we propose a GNN-based framework designed from the ground up to learn the dynamics of liquids under rigid body interactions and active manipulations, where particles are represented as graph nodes and particle-object collisions are handled using surface representations with the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) algorithm. This approach enables the network to model complex interactions between liquid particles and intricate surface geometries. Our model accurately captures fluid behavior in dynamic settings and can also function as a simulator in static free-fall environments. Despite being trained on a single-object manipulation task of pouring, our model generalizes effectively to environments with unseen objects and novel manipulation tasks such as stirring and scooping. Finally, we show that the learned dynamics can be leveraged to solve control and manipulation tasks using gradient-based optimization methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring a Graph-based Approach to Offline Reinforcement Learning for Sepsis Treatment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03393v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sepsis is a serious, life-threatening condition. When treating sepsis, it is challenging to determine the correct amount of intravenous fluids and vasopressors for a given patient. While automated reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have been used to support these decisions with promising results, previous studies have relied on relational data. Given the complexity of modern healthcare data, representing data as a graph may provide a more natural and effective approach. This study models patient data from the well-known MIMIC-III dataset as a heterogeneous graph that evolves over time. Subsequently, we explore two Graph Neural Network architectures - GraphSAGE and GATv2 - for learning patient state representations, adopting the approach of decoupling representation learning from policy learning. The encoders are trained to produce latent state representations, jointly with decoders that predict the next patient state. These representations are then used for policy learning with the dBCQ algorithm. The results of our experimental evaluation confirm the potential of a graph-based approach, while highlighting the complexity of representation learning in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>18th ...</summary><p>18th European Workshop on Reinforcement Learning (EWRL 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Transformer-Guided Content-Adaptive Graph Learning for Hyperspectral Unmixing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03376v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) targets to decompose each mixed pixel in remote sensing images into a set of endmembers and their corresponding abundances. Despite significant progress in this field using deep learning, most methods fail to simultaneously characterize global dependencies and local consistency, making it difficult to preserve both long-range interactions and boundary details. This letter proposes a novel transformer-guided content-adaptive graph unmixing framework (T-CAGU), which overcomes these challenges by employing a transformer to capture global dependencies and introducing a content-adaptive graph neural network to enhance local relationships. Unlike previous work, T-CAGU integrates multiple propagation orders to dynamically learn the graph structure, ensuring robustness against noise. Furthermore, T-CAGU leverages a graph residual mechanism to preserve global information and stabilize training. Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/T-CAGU.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Select MCP Algorithms: From Traditional ML to Dual-Channel GAT-MLP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08005v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extensive experiments and prior studies show that no single maximum clique algorithm consistently performs best across all instances, highlighting the importance of selecting suitable algorithms based on instance features. Through an extensive analysis of relevant studies, it is found that there is a lack of research work concerning algorithm selection oriented toward the Maximum Clique Problem (MCP). In this work, we propose a learning-based framework that integrates both traditional machine learning and graph neural networks to address this gap. We construct a labeled dataset by running four exact MCP algorithms on a diverse collection of graph instances, accompanied by structural and global statistical features extracted from each graph. We first evaluate four conventional classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), across multiple dataset variants. Experimental results show that RF consistently shows strong performance across metrics and dataset variants, making it a reliable baseline. In addition, feature importance analysis indicates that connectivity and topological structure are strong predictors of algorithm performance. Building on these findings, we develop a dual-channel model named GAT-MLP, which combines a Graph Attention Network (GAT) for local structural encoding with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for global feature modeling. The GAT-MLP model shows strong and consistent performance across all metrics. Our results highlight the effectiveness of dual-channel architectures and the promise of graph neural networks in combinatorial algorithm selection.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Temporal social network modeling of mobile connectivity data with graph neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03319v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art data-driven tool for modeling connectivity data of graph-structured complex networks and integrating information of their nodes and edges in space and time. However, as of yet, the analysis of social networks using the time series of people's mobile connectivity data has not been extensively investigated. In the present study, we investigate four snapshot - based temporal GNNs in predicting the phone call and SMS activity between users of a mobile communication network. In addition, we develop a simple non - GNN baseline model using recently proposed EdgeBank method. Our analysis shows that the ROLAND temporal GNN outperforms the baseline model in most cases, whereas the other three GNNs perform on average worse than the baseline. The results show that GNN based approaches hold promise in the analysis of temporal social networks through mobile connectivity data. However, due to the relatively small performance margin between ROLAND and the baseline model, further research is required on specialized GNN architectures for temporal social network analysis.</p></details> | 22 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Can Large Language Models Act as Ensembler for Multi-GNNs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16822v5)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for learning from graph-structured data. However, GNNs lack the inherent semantic understanding capability of rich textual node attributes, limiting their effectiveness in applications. On the other hand, we empirically observe that for existing GNN models, no one can consistently outperforms others across diverse datasets. In this paper, we study whether LLMs can act as an ensembler for multi-GNNs and propose the LensGNN model. The model first aligns multiple GNNs, mapping the representations of different GNNs into the same space. Then, through LoRA fine-tuning, it aligns the space between the GNN and the LLM, injecting graph tokens and textual information into LLMs. This allows LensGNN to ensemble multiple GNNs and take advantage of the strengths of LLM, leading to a deeper understanding of both textual semantic information and graph structural information. The experimental results show that LensGNN outperforms existing models. This research advances text-attributed graph ensemble learning by providing a robust and superior solution for integrating semantic and structural information.

However, the reliability of XAI is challenged by the Rashomon effect, where multiple, equally accurate models can offer divergent explanations for the same prediction. This paper provides the first empirical quantification of this effect for the task of action prediction in real-world driving scenes. Using Qualitative Explainable Graphs (QXGs) as a symbolic scene representation, we train Rashomon sets of two distinct model classes: interpretable, pair-based gradient boosting models and complex, graph-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Using feature attribution methods, we measure the agreement of explanations both within and between these classes. Our results reveal significant explanation disagreement. Our findings suggest that explanation ambiguity is an inherent property of the problem, not just a modeling artifact.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025 Fall Symposium: AI Trustworthiness and Risk Assessment for Challenged Contexts (ATRACC)</p></details> |
| **[Memorization in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19352v3)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to memorize their training data, yet similar analyses for graph neural networks (GNNs) remain largely under-explored. We introduce NCMemo (Node Classification Memorization), the first framework to quantify label memorization in semi-supervised node classification. We first establish an inverse relationship between memorization and graph homophily, i.e., the property that connected nodes share similar labels/features. We find that lower homophily significantly increases memorization, indicating that GNNs rely on memorization to learn less homophilic graphs. Secondly, we analyze GNN training dynamics. We find that the increased memorization in low homophily graphs is tightly coupled to the GNNs' implicit bias on using graph structure during learning. In low homophily regimes, this structure is less informative, hence inducing memorization of the node labels to minimize training loss. Finally, we show that nodes with higher label inconsistency in their feature-space neighborhood are significantly more prone to memorization. Building on our insights into the link between graph homophily and memorization, we investigate graph rewiring as a means to mitigate memorization. Our results demonstrate that this approach effectively reduces memorization without compromising model performance. Moreover, we show that it lowers the privacy risk for previously memorized data points in practice. Thus, our work not only advances understanding of GNN learning but also supports more privacy-preserving GNN deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version3, updated affiliation</p></details> |
| **[TRELLIS-Enhanced Surface Features for Comprehensive Intracranial Aneurysm Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03095v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intracranial aneurysms pose a significant clinical risk yet are difficult to detect, delineate and model due to limited annotated 3D data. We propose a cross-domain feature-transfer approach that leverages the latent geometric embeddings learned by TRELLIS, a generative model trained on large-scale non-medical 3D datasets, to augment neural networks for aneurysm analysis. By replacing conventional point normals or mesh descriptors with TRELLIS surface features, we systematically enhance three downstream tasks: (i) classifying aneurysms versus healthy vessels in the Intra3D dataset, (ii) segmenting aneurysm and vessel regions on 3D meshes, and (iii) predicting time-evolving blood-flow fields using a graph neural network on the AnXplore dataset. Our experiments show that the inclusion of these features yields strong gains in accuracy, F1-score and segmentation quality over state-of-the-art baselines, and reduces simulation error by 15\%. These results illustrate the broader potential of transferring 3D representations from general-purpose generative models to specialized medical tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Statistical Test for Saliency Maps of Graph Neural Networks via Selective Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16893v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained prominence for their ability to process graph-structured data across various domains. However, interpreting GNN decisions remains a significant challenge, leading to the adoption of saliency maps for identifying salient subgraphs composed of influential nodes and edges. Despite their utility, the reliability of GNN saliency maps has been questioned, particularly in terms of their robustness to input noise. In this study, we propose a statistical testing framework to rigorously evaluate the significance of saliency maps. Our main contribution lies in addressing the inflation of the Type I error rate caused by double-dipping of data, leveraging the framework of Selective Inference. Our method provides statistically valid $p$-values while controlling the Type I error rate, ensuring that identified salient subgraphs contain meaningful information rather than random artifacts. The method is applicable to a variety of saliency methods with piecewise linearity (e.g., Class Activation Mapping). We validate our method on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its capability in assessing the reliability of GNN interpretations.</p></details> |  |

Our method combines structural learning from graph neural networks (GNNs) with a learned distributed update mechanism that, given an edge addition or deletion event, modifies nodes' internal memories and infers their MaxIS membership in a single, parallel step. We parameterize our model by the update mechanism's radius and investigate the resulting performance-runtime tradeoffs for various dynamic graph topologies. We evaluate our model against a mixed integer programming solver and the state-of-the-art learning-based methods for MaxIS on static graphs (ICML 2020; NeurIPS 2020, 2023). Across synthetic and empirical dynamic graphs of 50-1,000 nodes, our model achieves competitive approximation ratios with excellent scalability; on large graphs, it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art learning methods in solution quality, runtime, and memory usage. When generalizing to graphs of 10,000 nodes (100x larger than the ones used for training), our model produces MaxIS solutions 1.05-1.18x larger than any other learning method, even while maintaining competitive runtimes.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables, 3 algorithms</p></details> |

To address this, we introduce RankGraph, a scalable graph learning framework designed to serve as a core component in recommendation foundation models (FMs). By constructing and leveraging graphs composed of heterogeneous nodes and edges across multiple products, RankGraph enables the integration of complex relationships between users, posts, ads, and other entities. Our framework employs a GPU-accelerated Graph Neural Network and contrastive learning, allowing for dynamic extraction of subgraphs such as item-item and user-user graphs to support similarity-based retrieval and real-time clustering. Furthermore, RankGraph integrates graph-based pretrained representations as contextual tokens into FM sequence models, enriching them with structured relational knowledge. RankGraph has demonstrated improvements in click (+0.92%) and conversion rates (+2.82%) in online A/B tests, showcasing its effectiveness in cross-domain recommendation scenarios.</p></details> | RecSys 2025 |

However, their high computational cost can limit its practicality. Alternative techniques, such as Monte Carlo dropout and deep kernel learning, have been proposed to improve computational efficiency; however, some of these methods cannot be applied to already trained models and may affect the prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient post-hoc framework for UQ that leverages the descriptor of a trained graph neural network potential to estimate residual errors. We refer to this method as post-hoc descriptor-based residual-based learning (PDRL). PDRL models the discrepancy between MLIP predictions and ground truth values, allowing these residuals to act as proxies for prediction uncertainty. We explore multiple variants of PDRL and benchmark them against established UQ methods, evaluating both their effectiveness and limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedGraph: A Research Library and Benchmark for Federated Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06340v4)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated graph learning is an emerging field with significant practical challenges. While algorithms have been proposed to improve the accuracy of training graph neural networks, such as node classification on federated graphs, the system performance is often overlooked, despite it is crucial for real-world deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce FedGraph, a research library designed for practical distributed training and comprehensive benchmarking of FGL algorithms. FedGraph supports a range of state-of-the-art graph learning methods and includes a monitoring class that evaluates system performance, with a particular focus on communication and computation costs during training. Unlike existing federated learning platforms, FedGraph natively integrates homomorphic encryption to enhance privacy preservation and supports scalable deployment across multiple physical machines with system-level performance evaluation to guide the system design of future algorithms. To enhance efficiency and privacy, we propose a low-rank communication scheme for algorithms like FedGCN that require pre-training communication, accelerating both the pre-training and training phases. Extensive experiments benchmark FGL algorithms on three major graph learning tasks and demonstrate FedGraph as the first efficient FGL framework to support encrypted low-rank communication and scale to graphs with 100 million nodes.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/FedGraph/fedgraph</p></details> |
| **[Power Grid Control with Graph-Based Distributed Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02861v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The necessary integration of renewable energy sources, combined with the expanding scale of power networks, presents significant challenges in controlling modern power grids. Traditional control systems, which are human and optimization-based, struggle to adapt and to scale in such an evolving context, motivating the exploration of more dynamic and distributed control strategies. This work advances a graph-based distributed reinforcement learning framework for real-time, scalable grid management. The proposed architecture consists of a network of distributed low-level agents acting on individual power lines and coordinated by a high-level manager agent. A Graph Neural Network (GNN) is employed to encode the network's topological information within the single low-level agent's observation. To accelerate convergence and enhance learning stability, the framework integrates imitation learning and potential-based reward shaping. In contrast to conventional decentralized approaches that decompose only the action space while relying on global observations, this method also decomposes the observation space. Each low-level agent acts based on a structured and informative local view of the environment constructed through the GNN. Experiments on the Grid2Op simulation environment show the effectiveness of the approach, which consistently outperforms the standard baseline commonly adopted in the field. Additionally, the proposed model proves to be much more computationally efficient than the simulation-based Expert method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Laplacian Eigenvectors: a Pre-training Method for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02803v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework for pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by inductively learning Laplacian eigenvectors. Traditional Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) often struggle to capture global and regional graph structure due to over-smoothing risk as network depth increases. Because the low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix encode global information, pre-training GNNs to predict these eigenvectors encourages the network to naturally learn large-scale structural patterns over each graph. Empirically, we show that models pre-trained via our framework outperform baseline models on a variety of graph structure-based tasks. While most existing pre-training methods focus on domain-specific tasks like node or edge feature reconstruction, our self-supervised pre-training framework is structure-based and highly flexible. Eigenvector-learning can be applied to all graph-based datasets, and can be used with synthetic features when task-specific data is sparse.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Composite-Loss Graph Neural Network for the Multivariate Post-Processing of Ensemble Weather Forecasts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02784v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensemble forecasting systems have advanced meteorology by providing probabilistic estimates of future states, supporting applications from renewable energy production to transportation safety. Nonetheless, systematic biases often persist, making statistical post-processing essential. Traditional parametric post-processing techniques and machine learning-based methods can produce calibrated predictive distributions at specific locations and lead times, yet often struggle to capture dependencies across forecast dimensions. To address this, multivariate post-processing methods-such as ensemble copula coupling and the Schaake shuffle-are widely applied in a second step to restore realistic inter-variable or spatio-temporal dependencies. The aim of this study is the multivariate post-processing of ensemble forecasts using a graph neural network (dualGNN) trained with a composite loss function that combines the energy score (ES) and the variogram score (VS). The method is evaluated on two datasets: WRF-based solar irradiance forecasts over northern Chile and ECMWF visibility forecasts for Central Europe. The dualGNN consistently outperforms all empirical copula-based post-processed forecasts and shows significant improvements compared to graph neural networks trained solely on either the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) or the ES, according to the evaluated multivariate verification metrics. Furthermore, for the WRF forecasts, the rank-order structure of the dualGNN forecasts captures valuable dependency information, enabling a more effective restoration of spatial relationships than either the raw numerical weather prediction ensemble or historical observational rank structures.

Due to the elusive syntax and complicated semantics in programs, most existing studies use techniques based on abstract syntax tree (AST) and graph neural networks (GNN) to create code representations for code classification. These techniques utilize the structure and semantic information of the code, but they only take into account pairwise associations and neglect the high-order data correlations that already exist between nodes of the same field or called attribute in the AST, which may result in the loss of code structural information. On the other hand, while a general hypergraph can encode high-order data correlations, it is homogeneous and undirected which will result in a lack of semantic and structural information such as node types, edge types, and directions between child nodes and parent nodes when modeling AST. In this study, we propose a heterogeneous directed hypergraph (HDHG) to represent AST and a heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) to process the graph for code classification. Our method improves code understanding and can represent high-order data correlations beyond paired interactions. We assess our heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) on public datasets of Python and Java programs. Our method outperforms previous AST-based and GNN-based methods, which demonstrates the capability of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the 35th International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering (SEKE 2023) as a regular paper</p></details> |

MatterVial expands the feature space by integrating latent representations from a diverse suite of pretrained graph neural network (GNN) models including: structure-based (MEGNet), composition-based (ROOST), and equivariant (ORB) graph networks, with computationally efficient, GNN-approximated descriptors and novel features from symbolic regression. Our approach combines the chemical transparency of traditional feature-based models with the predictive power of deep learning architectures. When augmenting the feature-based model MODNet on Matbench tasks, this method yields significant error reductions and elevates its performance to be competitive with, and in several cases superior to, state-of-the-art end-to-end GNNs, with accuracy increases exceeding 40% for multiple tasks. An integrated interpretability module, employing surrogate models and symbolic regression, decodes the latent GNN-derived descriptors into explicit, physically meaningful formulas. This unified framework advances materials informatics by providing a high-performance, transparent tool that aligns with the principles of explainable AI, paving the way for more targeted and autonomous materials discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[HydroGAT: Distributed Heterogeneous Graph Attention Transformer for Spatiotemporal Flood Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02481v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate flood forecasting remains a challenge for water-resource management, as it demands modeling of local, time-varying runoff drivers (e.g., rainfall-induced peaks, baseflow trends) and complex spatial interactions across a river network. Traditional data-driven approaches, such as convolutional networks and sequence-based models, ignore topological information about the region. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate information exactly along the river network, which is ideal for learning hydrological routing. However, state-of-the-art GNN-based flood prediction models collapse pixels to coarse catchment polygons as the cost of training explodes with graph size and higher resolution. Furthermore, most existing methods treat spatial and temporal dependencies separately, either applying GNNs solely on spatial graphs or transformers purely on temporal sequences, thus failing to simultaneously capture spatiotemporal interactions critical for accurate flood prediction. We introduce a heterogenous basin graph where every land and river pixel is a node connected by physical hydrological flow directions and inter-catchment relationships. We propose HydroGAT, a spatiotemporal network that adaptively learns local temporal importance and the most influential upstream locations. Evaluated in two Midwestern US basins and across five baseline architectures, our model achieves higher NSE (up to 0.97), improved KGE (up to 0.96), and low bias (PBIAS within $\pm$5%) in hourly discharge prediction, while offering interpretable attention maps that reveal sparse, structured intercatchment influences. To support high-resolution basin-scale training, we develop a distributed data-parallel pipeline that scales efficiently up to 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs on NERSC Perlmutter supercomputer, demonstrating up to 15x speedup across machines. Our code is available at https://github.com/swapp-lab/HydroGAT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The 33rd ACM International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems (SIGSPATIAL 25)</p></details> |

Among operational loads, traffic load plays a pivotal role, and recent advances in deep learning - particularly in computer vision (CV) - have enabled progress toward continuous, automated monitoring. However, CV-based approaches suffer from limitations, including privacy concerns and sensitivity to lighting conditions, while traditional non-vision-based methods often lack flexibility in deployment and validation. To bridge this gap, we propose a fully automated deep-learning pipeline for continuous traffic monitoring using structural health monitoring (SHM) sensor networks. Our approach integrates CV-assisted high-resolution dataset generation with supervised training and inference, leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture the spatial structure and interdependence of sensor data. By transferring knowledge from CV outputs to SHM sensors, the proposed framework enables sensor networks to achieve comparable accuracy of vision-based systems, with minimal human intervention. Applied to accelerometer and strain gauge data in a real-world case study, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with classification accuracies of 99% for light vehicles and 94% for heavy vehicles.</p></details> |  |

Current \textit{online} trackers rely on frame-by-frame hand-crafted association strategies and struggle with long-term occlusions, whereas \textit{offline} approaches can cover larger time gaps, but still rely on heuristic stitching for arbitrarily long sequences. In this paper, we introduce NOOUGAT, the first tracker designed to operate with arbitrary temporal horizons. NOOUGAT leverages a unified Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that processes non-overlapping subclips, and fuses them through a novel Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer. The subclip size controls the trade-off between latency and temporal context, enabling a wide range of deployment scenarios, from frame-by-frame to batch processing. NOOUGAT achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tracking regimes, improving \textit{online} AssA by +2.3 on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, and +5.0 on MOT20, with even greater gains in \textit{offline} mode.</p></details> |  |
| **[Second-Order Tensorial Partial Differential Equations on Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02015v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Processing data that lies on multiple interacting (product) graphs is increasingly important in practical applications, yet existing methods are mostly restricted to discrete graph filtering. Tensorial partial differential equations on graphs (TPDEGs) offer a principled framework for modeling such multidomain data in a continuous setting. However, current continuous approaches are limited to first-order derivatives, which tend to dampen high-frequency signals and slow down information propagation. This makes these TPDEGs-based approaches less effective for capturing complex, multi-scale, and heterophilic structures. In this paper, we introduce second-order TPDEGs (So-TPDEGs) and propose the first theoretically grounded framework for second-order continuous product graph neural networks. Our approach leverages the separability of cosine kernels in Cartesian product graphs to implement efficient spectral decomposition, while naturally preserving high-frequency information. We provide rigorous theoretical analyses of stability under graph perturbations and over-smoothing behavior regarding spectral properties. Our theoretical results establish a robust foundation for advancing continuous graph learning across multiple practical domains.</p></details> | 12 pages, 1 figure |

Process-based models provide physical realism but can suffer from structural rigidity, high computational costs, and complex calibration, while machine learning (ML) methods are efficient and flexible yet often lack interpretability and transferability. We propose a unified three-phase framework that integrates process-based models with ML and progressively embeds them into artificial intelligence (AI) through knowledge distillation. Phase I, behavioral distillation, enhances process models via surrogate learning and model simplification to capture key dynamics at lower computational cost. Phase II, structural distillation, reformulates process equations as modular components within a graph neural network (GNN), enabling multiscale representation and seamless integration with ML models. Phase III, cognitive distillation, embeds expert reasoning and adaptive decision-making into intelligent modeling agents using the Eyes-Brain-Hands-Mouth architecture. Demonstrations for the Samish watershed highlight the framework's applicability to ecohydrological modeling, showing that it can reproduce process-based model outputs, improve predictive accuracy, and support scenario-based decision-making. The framework offers a scalable and transferable pathway toward next-generation intelligent ecohydrological modeling systems, with the potential extension to other process-based domains.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

Previous research has looked into this problem from the perspective of i.i.d. data. Here, we develop a framework, GraCE-VAE, for non-i.i.d. settings, in which structured context in the form of network data is available. GraCE-VAE integrates discrepancy-based variational autoencoders with graph neural networks to jointly recover the true latent causal graph and intervention effects. We show that the theoretical results of identifiability from i.i.d. data hold in our setup. We also empirically evaluate GraCE-VAE against state-of-the-art baselines on three genetic perturbation datasets to demonstrate the impact of leveraging structured context for causal disentanglement.</p></details> |  |

Eye Tracking-Based Modeling of Situational Awareness in Augmented Reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05025v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Augmented Reality (AR) systems, while enhancing task performance through real-time guidance, pose risks of inducing cognitive tunneling-a hyperfocus on virtual content that compromises situational awareness (SA) in safety-critical scenarios. This paper investigates SA in AR-guided cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), where responders must balance effective compressions with vigilance to unpredictable hazards (e.g., patient vomiting). We developed an AR app on a Magic Leap 2 that overlays real-time CPR feedback (compression depth and rate) and conducted a user study with simulated unexpected incidents (e.g., bleeding) to evaluate SA, in which SA metrics were collected via observation and questionnaires administered during freeze-probe events. Eye tracking analysis revealed that higher SA levels were associated with greater saccadic amplitude and velocity, and with reduced proportion and frequency of fixations on virtual content. To predict SA, we propose FixGraphPool, a graph neural network that structures gaze events (fixations, saccades) into spatiotemporal graphs, effectively capturing dynamic attentional patterns. Our model achieved 83.0% accuracy (F1=81.0%), outperforming feature-based machine learning and state-of-the-art time-series models by leveraging domain knowledge and spatial-temporal information encoded in ET data. These findings demonstrate the potential of eye tracking for SA modeling in AR and highlight its utility in designing AR systems that ensure user safety and situational awareness.</p></details> |  |

However, the high dimensionality and technical noise inherent in scRNA-seq data pose significant analytical challenges. While current embedding methods focus primarily on gene expression levels, they often overlook crucial gene-gene interactions that govern cellular identity and function. To address this limitation, we present a novel embedding approach that integrates both gene expression profiles and data-driven gene-gene interactions. Our method first constructs a Cell-Leaf Graph (CLG) using random forest models to capture regulatory relationships between genes, while simultaneously building a K-Nearest Neighbor Graph (KNNG) to represent expression similarities between cells. These graphs are then combined into an Enriched Cell-Leaf Graph (ECLG), which serves as input for a graph neural network to compute cell embeddings. By incorporating both expression levels and gene-gene interactions, our approach provides a more comprehensive representation of cellular states. Extensive evaluation across multiple datasets demonstrates that our method enhances the detection of rare cell populations and improves downstream analyses such as visualization, clustering, and trajectory inference. This integrated approach represents a significant advance in single-cell data analysis, offering a more complete framework for understanding cellular diversity and dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 9 figures, article</p></details> |

Automated Essay Scoring (AES) offers a promising alternative, but current approaches face limitations. Recent studies have incorporated Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into AES using static word embeddings that fail to capture contextual meaning, especially for polysemous words. Additionally, many methods rely on holistic scoring, overlooking specific writing aspects such as grammar, vocabulary, and cohesion. To address these challenges, this study proposes TransGAT, a novel approach that integrates fine-tuned Transformer models with GNNs for analytic scoring. TransGAT combines the contextual understanding of Transformers with the relational modeling strength of Graph Attention Networks (GAT). It performs two-stream predictions by pairing each fine-tuned Transformer (BERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTaV3) with a separate GAT. In each pair, the first stream generates essay-level predictions, while the second applies GAT to Transformer token embeddings, with edges constructed from syntactic dependencies. The model then fuses predictions from both streams to produce the final analytic score. Experiments on the ELLIPSE dataset show that TransGAT outperforms baseline models, achieving an average Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.854 across all analytic scoring dimensions. These findings highlight the potential of TransGAT to advance AES systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Contrastive Learning versus Untrained Baselines: The Role of Dataset Size](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01541v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a leading paradigm for self-supervised learning on graphs, with strong performance reported on standardized datasets and growing applications ranging from genomics to drug discovery. We ask a basic question: does GCL actually outperform untrained baselines? We find that GCL's advantage depends strongly on dataset size and task difficulty. On standard datasets, untrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), simple multilayer perceptrons, and even handcrafted statistics can rival or exceed GCL. On the large molecular dataset ogbg-molhiv, we observe a crossover: GCL lags at small scales but pulls ahead beyond a few thousand graphs, though this gain eventually plateaus. On synthetic datasets, GCL accuracy approximately scales with the logarithm of the number of graphs and its performance gap (compared with untrained GNNs) varies with respect to task complexity. Moving forward, it is crucial to identify the role of dataset size in benchmarks and applications, as well as to design GCL algorithms that avoid performance plateaus.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

A key characteristic of GNNs is their use of a fixed number of message-passing steps for all nodes in the graph, regardless of each node's diverse computational needs and characteristics. Through empirical real-world data analysis, we demonstrate that the optimal number of message-passing layers varies for nodes with different characteristics. This finding is further supported by experiments conducted on synthetic datasets. To address this, we propose Adaptive Depth Message Passing GNN (ADMP-GNN), a novel framework that dynamically adjusts the number of message passing layers for each node, resulting in improved performance. This approach applies to any model that follows the message passing scheme. We evaluate ADMP-GNN on the node classification task and observe performance improvements over baseline GNN models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Exploring Language Models for Explainable Link Forecasting on Temporal Graphs via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00975v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting future links is a central task in temporal graph (TG) reasoning, requiring models to leverage historical interactions to predict upcoming ones. Traditional neural approaches, such as temporal graph neural networks, achieve strong performance but lack explainability and cannot be applied to unseen graphs without retraining. Recent studies have begun to explore using large language models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to static graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of reasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced Learning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs. ReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning strategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly justify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning traces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an LLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the impact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning Qwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier LLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality explanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.</p></details> |  |

We study superposition, the sharing of directions by multiple features, directly in the latent space of GNNs. Using controlled experiments with unambiguous graph concepts, we extract features as (i) class-conditional centroids at the graph level and (ii) linear-probe directions at the node level, and then analyze their geometry with simple basis-invariant diagnostics. Across GCN/GIN/GAT we find: increasing width produces a phase pattern in overlap; topology imprints overlap onto node-level features that pooling partially remixes into task-aligned graph axes; sharper pooling increases axis alignment and reduces channel sharing; and shallow models can settle into metastable low-rank embeddings. These results connect representational geometry with concrete design choices (width, pooling, and final-layer activations) and suggest practical approaches for more interpretable GNNs.</p></details> |  |

Our method explicitly bridges physical spectral measurements and chemical structural semantics by representing them in a unified Textual Graph format, enabling flexible, interpretable, and generalizable spectral understanding. Raw spectra are first transformed into TAGs, where nodes and edges are enriched with textual attributes describing both spectral properties and chemical context. These are then merged with relevant prior knowledge-including functional groups and molecular graphs-to form a Task Graph that incorporates "Prompt Nodes" supporting LLM-based contextual reasoning. A Graph Neural Network further processes this structure to complete downstream tasks. This unified design enables seamless multi-modal integration and automated feature decoding with minimal manual annotation. Our framework achieves consistently high performance across multiple spectral analysis tasks, including node-level, edge-level, and graph-level classification. It demonstrates robust generalization in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, highlighting its effectiveness in learning from limited data and supporting in-context reasoning. This work establishes a scalable and interpretable foundation for LLM-driven spectral analysis, unifying physical and chemical modalities for scientific applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ne...</summary><p>We need to further modify and supplement the experiment</p></details> |

In recent years, researchers have made significant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for spatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic, i.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty, leading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies have introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically focus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes), thereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban phenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network with Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal prediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware Spatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph convolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network to effectively capture complex spatial and temporal interaction patterns, and (ii) a multivariate probabilistic prediction module designed to estimate both expected mean values and associated uncertainties. Extensive experiments on four real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets from Shenzhen, New York City, and Chicago demonstrate that UQGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification. For example, on the Shenzhen dataset, UQGNN achieves a 5% improvement in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, SIGSPATIAL 2025</p></details> |

To tackle this, methods like coarsening, condensation, and computation trees are used to train on a smaller graph, resulting in faster computation. Nonetheless, prior research has not adequately addressed the computational costs during the inference phase. This paper presents a novel approach to improve the scalability of GNNs by reducing computational burden during the inference phase using graph coarsening. We demonstrate two different methods -- Extra Nodes and Cluster Nodes. Our study extends the application of graph coarsening for graph-level tasks, including graph classification and graph regression. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of our approach. Our results show that the proposed method achieves orders of magnitude improvements in single-node inference time compared to traditional approaches. Furthermore, it significantly reduces memory consumption for node and graph classification and regression tasks, enabling efficient training and inference on low-resource devices where conventional methods are impractical. Notably, these computational advantages are achieved while maintaining competitive performance relative to baseline models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flow Matters: Directional and Expressive GNNs for Heterophilic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00772v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In heterophilic graphs, where neighboring nodes often belong to different classes, conventional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) struggle due to their reliance on local homophilous neighborhoods. Prior studies suggest that modeling edge directionality in such graphs can increase effective homophily and improve classification performance. Simultaneously, recent work on polynomially expressive GNNs shows promise in capturing higher-order interactions among features. In this work, we study the combined effect of edge directionality and expressive message passing on node classification in heterophilic graphs. Specifically, we propose two architectures: (1) a polynomially expressive GAT baseline (Poly), and (2) a direction-aware variant (Dir-Poly) that separately aggregates incoming and outgoing edges. Both models are designed to learn permutation-equivariant high-degree polynomials over input features, while remaining scalable with no added time complexity. Experiments on five benchmark heterophilic datasets show that our Poly model consistently outperforms existing baselines, and that Dir-Poly offers additional gains on graphs with inherent directionality (e.g., Roman Empire), achieving state-of-the-art results. Interestingly, on undirected graphs, introducing artificial directionality does not always help, suggesting that the benefit of directional message passing is context-dependent. Our findings highlight the complementary roles of edge direction and expressive feature modeling in heterophilic graph learning.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches either convert graph structures into verbose textual descriptions, consuming substantial computational resources, or employ complex graph neural networks as tokenizers, which introduce significant training overhead. To bridge this gap, we present NT-LLM, a novel framework with an anchor-based positional encoding scheme for graph representation. Our approach strategically selects reference nodes as anchors and encodes each node's position relative to these anchors, capturing essential topological information without the computational burden of existing methods. Notably, we identify and address a fundamental issue: the inherent misalignment between discrete hop-based distances in graphs and continuous distances in embedding spaces. By implementing a rank-preserving objective for positional encoding pretraining, NT-LLM achieves superior performance across diverse graph tasks ranging from basic structural analysis to complex reasoning scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that this lightweight yet powerful approach effectively enhances LLMs' ability to understand and reason with graph-structured information, offering an efficient solution for graph-based applications of language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |

While decomposition-integrated approaches like variational mode graph convolutional network (VMGCN) improve accuracy through signal decomposition, they suffer from computational inefficiency and manual hyperparameter tuning. To address these limitations, we propose the mode adaptive graph network (MAGN) that transforms iterative variational mode decomposition (VMD) into a trainable neural module. Our key innovations include (1) an unfolded VMD (UVMD) module that replaces iterative optimization with a fixed-depth network to reduce the decomposition time (by 250x for the LargeST benchmark), and (2) mode-specific learnable bandwidth constraints ({\alpha}k ) adapt spatial heterogeneity and eliminate manual tuning while preventing spectral overlap. Evaluated on the LargeST benchmark (6,902 sensors, 241M observations), MAGN achieves an 85-95% reduction in the prediction error over VMGCN and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review in IEEE Signal Processing Letter</p></details> |

Our approach is grounded in semantic parsing, a key technique for interpreting question utterances. The main challenges arise from handling implicit entities and relations, as well as complex constraints such as temporal conditions, ordinality, and aggregation within the context of a knowledge graph. To address these issues, our framework integrates both rule-based and neural methods to parse and construct accurate, comprehensive semantic segment sequences. These sequences are then assembled into semantic query graphs, providing precise representations of question utterances. We formulate question semantic parsing as a sequence generation task, employing an encoder-decoder neural network to map natural language questions into semantic segments. Furthermore, to enhance the identification of implicit entities and relations, we incorporate a graph neural network that leverages knowledge graph context to enrich question representations. Experimental evaluations on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of our model in semantic parsing for knowledge graph question answering.</p></details> |  |

These applications place higher demands on model compression and inference speed, necessitating the transfer of knowledge from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to more efficient Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models. However, due to their fixed activation functions and fully connected architecture, MLPs face challenges in rapidly capturing the complex neighborhood dependencies learned by GNNs, thereby limiting their performance in edge environments. To address these limitations, this paper introduces an innovative from GNNs to Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) knowledge distillation framework-Self Attention Dynamic Sampling Distillation (SA-DSD). This study improved Fourier KAN (FR-KAN) and replaced MLP with the improved FR-KAN+ as the student model. Through the incorporation of learnable frequency bases and phase-shift mechanisms, along with algorithmic optimization, FR-KAN significantly improves its nonlinear fitting capability while effectively reducing computational complexity. Building on this, a margin-level sampling probability matrix, based on teacher-student prediction consistency, is constructed, and an adaptive weighted loss mechanism is designed to mitigate performance degradation in the student model due to the lack of explicit neighborhood aggregation. Extensive experiments conducted on six real-world datasets demonstrate that SA-DSD achieves performance improvements of 3.05%-3.62% over three GNN teacher models and 15.61% over the FR-KAN+ model. Moreover, when compared with key benchmark models, SA-DSD achieves a 16.96x reduction in parameter count and a 55.75% decrease in inference time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Curriculum Guided Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00402v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subgraph Federated Learning (FL) aims to train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) across distributed private subgraphs, but it suffers from severe data heterogeneity. To mitigate data heterogeneity, weighted model aggregation personalizes each local GNN by assigning larger weights to parameters from clients with similar subgraph characteristics inferred from their current model states. However, the sparse and biased subgraphs often trigger rapid overfitting, causing the estimated client similarity matrix to stagnate or even collapse. As a result, aggregation loses effectiveness as clients reinforce their own biases instead of exploiting diverse knowledge otherwise available. To this end, we propose a novel personalized subgraph FL framework called Curriculum guided personalized sUbgraph Federated Learning (CUFL). On the client side, CUFL adopts Curriculum Learning (CL) that adaptively selects edges for training according to their reconstruction scores, exposing each GNN first to easier, generic cross-client substructures and only later to harder, client-specific ones. This paced exposure prevents early overfitting to biased patterns and enables gradual personalization. By regulating personalization, the curriculum also reshapes server aggregation from exchanging generic knowledge to propagating client-specific knowledge. Further, CUFL improves weighted aggregation by estimating client similarity using fine-grained structural indicators reconstructed on a random reference graph. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets confirm that CUFL achieves superior performance compared to relevant baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/Kang-Min-Ku/CUFL.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the CIKM 2025.

| **[Unifying Adversarial Perturbation for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00387v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the vulnerability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to adversarial attacks on node features and graph structure. Various methods have implemented adversarial training to augment graph data, aiming to bolster the robustness and generalization of GNNs. These methods typically involve applying perturbations to the node feature, weights, or graph structure and subsequently minimizing the loss by learning more robust graph model parameters under the adversarial perturbations. Despite the effectiveness of adversarial training in enhancing GNNs' robustness and generalization abilities, its application has been largely confined to specific datasets and GNN types. In this paper, we propose a novel method, PerturbEmbedding, that integrates adversarial perturbation and training, enhancing GNNs' resilience to such attacks and improving their generalization ability. PerturbEmbedding performs perturbation operations directly on every hidden embedding of GNNs and provides a unified framework for most existing perturbation strategies/methods. We also offer a unified perspective on the forms of perturbations, namely random and adversarial perturbations. Through experiments on various datasets using different backbone models, we demonstrate that PerturbEmbedding significantly improves both the robustness and generalization abilities of GNNs, outperforming existing methods. The rejection of both random (non-targeted) and adversarial (targeted) perturbations further enhances the backbone model's performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Demon is in Ambiguity: Revisiting Situation Recognition with Single Positive Multi-Label Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21816v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling), and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization). Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning (SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDM 2025</p></details> |
| **[On the Hardness of Learning GNN-based SAT Solvers: The Role of Graph Ricci Curvature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21513v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown promise as solvers for Boolean Satisfiability Problems (SATs) by operating on graph representations of logical formulas. However, their performance degrades sharply on harder instances, raising the question of whether this reflects fundamental architectural limitations. In this work, we provide a geometric explanation through the lens of graph Ricci Curvature (RC), which quantifies local connectivity bottlenecks. We prove that bipartite graphs derived from random k-SAT formulas are inherently negatively curved, and that this curvature decreases with instance difficulty. Building on this, we show that GNN-based SAT solvers are affected by oversquashing, a phenomenon where long-range dependencies become impossible to compress into fixed-length representations. We validate our claims empirically across different SAT benchmarks and confirm that curvature is both a strong indicator of problem complexity and can be used to predict performance. Finally, we connect our findings to design principles of existing solvers and outline promising directions for future work.</p></details> | Preprint |

While CP algorithms have evolved beyond traditional classifiers and regressors to sophisticated deep learning models like deep neural networks (DNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and large language models (LLMs), existing CP libraries often lack the model support and scalability for large-scale DL scenarios. This paper introduces TorchCP, a PyTorch-native library designed to integrate state-of-the-art CP algorithms into deep learning techniques, including DNN-based classifier/regressor, GNN, and LLM. Released under the LGPL-3.0 license, TorchCP comprises about 16k lines of code, validated with 100% unit test coverage and detailed documentation. Notably, TorchCP enables CP-specific training algorithms, online prediction, and GPU-accelerated batch processing, achieving up to 90% reduction in inference time on large datasets. With its low-coupling design, comprehensive suite of advanced methods, and full GPU scalability, TorchCP empowers researchers and practitioners to enhance uncertainty quantification across cutting-edge applications.</p></details> |  |

Recently, molecular ML has demonstrated great potential in (i) providing highly accurate predictions for properties of pure components and their mixtures, and (ii) exploring the chemical space for new molecular structures. We review current state-of-the-art molecular ML models and discuss research directions that promise further advancements. This includes ML methods, such as graph neural networks and transformers, which can be further advanced through the incorporation of physicochemical knowledge in a hybrid or physics-informed fashion. Then, we consider leveraging molecular ML at the chemical process scale, which is highly desirable yet rather unexplored. We discuss how molecular ML can be integrated into process design and optimization formulations, promising to accelerate the identification of novel molecules and processes. To this end, it will be essential to create molecule and process design benchmarks and practically validate proposed candidates, possibly in collaboration with the chemical industry.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Mixture of Experts Gating Network for Enhanced Surrogate Modeling in External Aerodynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21249v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The computational cost associated with high-fidelity CFD simulations remains a significant bottleneck in the automotive design and optimization cycle. While ML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate aerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly evolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single model demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel meta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a strength. We propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that employs a dedicated gating network to dynamically and optimally combine the predictions from three heterogeneous, state-of-the-art surrogate models: DoMINO, a decomposable multi-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph neural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution network. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy, assigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in predicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model collapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy regularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is trained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark of high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative results demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2 prediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most accurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities. This work establishes the MoE framework as a powerful and effective strategy for creating more robust and accurate composite surrogate models by synergistically combining the complementary strengths of specialized architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph-Based Feature Augmentation for Predictive Tasks on Relational Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20986v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data has become a foundational asset driving innovation across domains such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. In these areas, predictive modeling over relational tables is commonly employed, with increasing emphasis on reducing manual effort through automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques. This raises an interesting question: can feature augmentation itself be automated and identify and utilize task-related relational signals? To address this challenge, we propose an end-to-end automated feature augmentation framework, ReCoGNN, which enhances initial datasets using features extracted from multiple relational tables to support predictive tasks. ReCoGNN first captures semantic dependencies within each table by modeling intra-table attribute relationships, enabling it to partition tables into structured, semantically coherent segments. It then constructs a heterogeneous weighted graph that represents inter-row relationships across all segments. Finally, ReCoGNN leverages message-passing graph neural networks to propagate information through the graph, guiding feature selection and augmenting the original dataset. Extensive experiments conducted on ten real-life and synthetic datasets demonstrate that ReCoGNN consistently outperforms existing methods on both classification and regression tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning Based Concurrency Bug Detection and Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20911v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concurrency bugs, caused by improper synchronization of shared resources in multi-threaded or distributed systems, are notoriously hard to detect and thus compromise software reliability and security. The existing deep learning methods face three main limitations. First, there is an absence of large and dedicated datasets of diverse concurrency bugs for them. Second, they lack sufficient representation of concurrency semantics. Third, binary classification results fail to provide finer-grained debug information such as precise bug lines. To address these problems, we propose a novel method for effective concurrency bug detection as well as localization. We construct a dedicated concurrency bug dataset to facilitate model training and evaluation. We then integrate a pre-trained model with a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN), by incorporating a new Concurrency-Aware Code Property Graph (CCPG) that concisely and effectively characterizes concurrency semantics. To further facilitate debugging, we employ SubgraphX, a GNN-based interpretability method, which explores the graphs to precisely localize concurrency bugs, mapping them to specific lines of source code. On average, our method demonstrates an improvement of 10\% in accuracy and precision and 26\% in recall compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse evaluation settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[ADAGE: Active Defenses Against GNN Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00065v3)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) achieve high performance in various real-world applications, such as drug discovery, traffic states prediction, and recommendation systems. The fact that building powerful GNNs requires a large amount of training data, powerful computing resources, and human expertise turns the models into lucrative targets for model stealing attacks. Prior work has revealed that the threat vector of stealing attacks against GNNs is large and diverse, as an attacker can leverage various heterogeneous signals ranging from node labels to high-dimensional node embeddings to create a local copy of the target GNN at a fraction of the original training costs. This diversity in the threat vector renders the design of effective and general defenses challenging and existing defenses usually focus on one particular stealing setup. Additionally, they solely provide means to identify stolen model copies rather than preventing the attack. To close this gap, we propose the first and general Active Defense Against GNN Extraction (ADAGE). ADAGE builds on the observation that stealing a model's full functionality requires highly diverse queries to leak its behavior across the input space. Our defense monitors this query diversity and progressively perturbs outputs as the accumulated leakage grows. In contrast to prior work, ADAGE can prevent stealing across all common attack setups. Our extensive experimental evaluation using six benchmark datasets, four GNN models, and three types of adaptive attackers shows that ADAGE penalizes attackers to the degree of rendering stealing impossible, whilst preserving predictive performance on downstream tasks. ADAGE, thereby, contributes towards securely sharing valuable GNNs in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Not a...</summary><p>Not all authors have given their explicit consent</p></details> |

Recent graph-based detectors make headway by representing transactions as networks, but they still overlook two fraud hallmarks rooted in time: (1) temporal motifs--recurring, telltale subgraphs that reveal suspicious money flows as they unfold--and (2) account-specific intervals of anomalous activity, when fraud surfaces only in short bursts unique to each entity. To exploit both signals, we introduce ATM-GAD, an adaptive graph neural network that leverages temporal motifs for financial anomaly detection. A Temporal Motif Extractor condenses each account's transaction history into the most informative motifs, preserving both topology and temporal patterns. These motifs are then analyzed by dual-attention blocks: IntraA reasons over interactions within a single motif, while InterA aggregates evidence across motifs to expose multi-step fraud schemes. In parallel, a differentiable Adaptive Time-Window Learner tailors the observation window for every node, allowing the model to focus precisely on the most revealing time slices. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that ATM-GAD consistently outperforms seven strong anomaly-detection baselines, uncovering fraud patterns missed by earlier methods.</p></details> |  |

At its core, QGAT employs strongly entangling quantum circuits with amplitude-encoded node features to enable expressive nonlinear interactions. Distinct from classical multi-head attention that separately computes each head, QGAT leverages a single quantum circuit to simultaneously generate multiple attention coefficients. This quantum parallelism facilitates parameter sharing across heads, substantially reducing computational overhead and model complexity. Classical projection weights and quantum circuit parameters are optimized jointly in an end-to-end manner, ensuring flexible adaptation to learning tasks. Empirical results demonstrate QGAT's effectiveness in capturing complex structural dependencies and improved generalization in inductive scenarios, highlighting its potential for scalable quantum-enhanced learning across domains such as chemistry, biology, and network analysis. Furthermore, experiments confirm that quantum embedding enhances robustness against feature and structural noise, suggesting advantages in handling real-world noisy data. The modularity of QGAT also ensures straightforward integration into existing architectures, allowing it to easily augment classical attention-based models.</p></details> |  |
| **[LASE: Learned Adjacency Spectral Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17734v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We put forth a principled design of a neural architecture to learn nodal Adjacency Spectral Embeddings (ASE) from graph inputs. By bringing to bear the gradient descent (GD) method and leveraging the principle of algorithm unrolling, we truncate and re-interpret each GD iteration as a layer in a graph neural network (GNN) that is trained to approximate the ASE. Accordingly, we call the resulting embeddings and our parametric model Learned ASE (LASE), which is interpretable, parameter efficient, robust to inputs with unobserved edges, and offers controllable complexity during inference. LASE layers combine Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and fully-connected Graph Attention Network (GAT) modules, which is intuitively pleasing since GCN-based local aggregations alone are insufficient to express the sought graph eigenvectors. We propose several refinements to the unrolled LASE architecture (such as sparse attention in the GAT module and decoupled layerwise parameters) that offer favorable approximation error versus computation tradeoffs; even outperforming heavily-optimized eigendecomposition routines from scientific computing libraries. Because LASE is a differentiable function with respect to its parameters as well as its graph input, we can seamlessly integrate it as a trainable module within a larger (semi-)supervised graph representation learning pipeline. The resulting end-to-end system effectively learns ``discriminative ASEs'' that exhibit competitive performance in supervised link prediction and node classification tasks, outperforming a GNN even when the latter is endowed with open loop, meaning task-agnostic, precomputed spectral positional encodings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Local Virtual Nodes for Alleviating Over-Squashing in Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20597v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over-squashing is a challenge in training graph neural networks for tasks involving long-range dependencies. In such tasks, a GNN's receptive field should be large enough to enable communication between distant nodes. However, gathering information from a wide range of neighborhoods and squashing its content into fixed-size node representations makes message-passing vulnerable to bottlenecks. Graph rewiring and adding virtual nodes are commonly studied remedies that create additional pathways around bottlenecks to mitigate over-squashing. However, these techniques alter the input graph's global topology and disrupt the domain knowledge encoded in the original graph structure, both of which could be essential to specific tasks and domains. This study presents Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings to alleviate the effects of over-squashing without significantly corrupting the global structure of the input graph. The position of the LVNs is determined by the node centrality, which indicates the existence of potential bottlenecks. Thus, the proposed approach aims to improve the connectivity in the regions with likely bottlenecks. Furthermore, trainable LVN embeddings shared across selected central regions facilitate communication between distant nodes without adding more layers. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LVNs can enhance structural connectivity and significantly improve performance on graph and node classification tasks.

Rethinking Evaluations for Graph-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20583v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developments in Graph-Language Models (GLMs) aim to integrate the structural reasoning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the semantic understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, we demonstrate that current evaluation benchmarks for GLMs, which are primarily repurposed node-level classification datasets, are insufficient to assess multimodal reasoning. Our analysis reveals that strong performance on these benchmarks is achievable using unimodal information alone, suggesting that they do not necessitate graph-language integration. To address this evaluation gap, we introduce the CLEGR(Compositional Language-Graph Reasoning) benchmark, designed to evaluate multimodal reasoning at various complexity levels. Our benchmark employs a synthetic graph generation pipeline paired with questions that require joint reasoning over structure and textual semantics. We perform a thorough evaluation of representative GLM architectures and find that soft-prompted LLM baselines perform on par with GLMs that incorporate a full GNN backbone. This result calls into question the architectural necessity of incorporating graph structure into LLMs. We further show that GLMs exhibit significant performance degradation in tasks that require structural reasoning. These findings highlight limitations in the graph reasoning capabilities of current GLMs and provide a foundation for advancing the community toward explicit multimodal reasoning involving graph structure and language.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce TRIGON, a novel framework that constructs enriched, non-planar triangulations by learning to select relevant triangles from multiple graph views. By jointly optimizing triangle selection and downstream classification performance, our method produces a rewired graph with markedly improved structural properties such as reduced diameter, increased spectral gap, and lower effective resistance compared to existing rewiring methods.

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling interactions between medical codes within EHR. However, existing GNN-based methods are inadequate due to: a) their reliance on pairwise relations fails to capture the inherent higher-order dependencies in clinical data, and b) the localized message-passing scheme limits representation power. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) framework following three-fold ideas: a) employing a hypergraph structural encoder to capture higher-order interactions among medical codes, b) integrating the Transformer architecture to reason over the entire hypergraph, and c) designing a tailored loss function incorporating hypergraph reconstruction to preserve the hypergraph's original structure. Experiments on real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that the proposed SHGT outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on diagnosis prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-Rank Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Decomposition and Bases of Equivariant Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18263v7)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs) play a crucial role in the design of equivariant graph neural networks, as well as in theoretical chemistry and chemical physics. Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT decomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for high-rank tensors. After decades of research, Bonvicini (2024) has recently achieved an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ with factorial time/space complexity. In this work we, for the first time, obtain decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via performing chain-like contractions with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the parentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices is an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product space and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete orthogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set (Pearce-Crump, 2023b), through this path matrices technique. Our method avoids the RREF algorithm and maintains a fully analytical derivation of each ICT decomposition matrix, thereby significantly improving the algorithm's speed to obtain arbitrary rank orthogonal ICT decomposition matrices and orthogonal equivariant bases. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product and direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while keeping symmetry. The Python code is available at https://github.com/ShihaoShao-GH/ICT-decomposition-and-equivariant-bases, where the $n=6,\dots,9$ ICT decomposition matrices are obtained in 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s on 28-core Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 CPU @ 2.00GHz, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>53 pa...</summary><p>53 pages.

However, mainstream approaches generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters and fixed aggregation rules, making it difficult to adapt to graph data with strong structural heterogeneity and complex feature distributions. This often leads to over-smoothing of node representations and semantic degradation. To address these issues, this paper proposes a parameter-free graph neural network framework based on structural diversity, namely SDGNN (Structural-Diversity Graph Neural Network). The framework is inspired by structural diversity theory and designs a unified structural-diversity message passing mechanism that simultaneously captures the heterogeneity of neighborhood structures and the stability of feature semantics, without introducing additional trainable parameters. Unlike traditional parameterized methods, SDGNN does not rely on complex model training, but instead leverages complementary modeling from both structure-driven and feature-driven perspectives, thereby effectively improving adaptability across datasets and scenarios. Experimental results show that on eight public benchmark datasets and an interdisciplinary PubMed citation network, SDGNN consistently outperforms mainstream GNNs under challenging conditions such as low supervision, class imbalance, and cross-domain transfer. This work provides a new theoretical perspective and general approach for the design of parameter-free graph neural networks, and further validates the importance of structural diversity as a core signal in graph representation learning.

The majority of existing solutions towards link sign prediction mainly focus on unipartite signed graphs, which are sub-optimal due to the neglect of node heterogeneity and unique bipartite characteristics of SBGs. To this end, recent studies adapt graph neural networks to SBGs by introducing message-passing schemes for both inter-partition (UxV) and intra-partition (UxU or VxV) node pairs. However, the fundamental spectral convolutional operators were originally designed for positive links in unsigned graphs, and thus, are not optimal for inferring missing positive or negative links from known ones in SBGs. Motivated by this, this paper proposes GegenNet, a novel and effective spectral convolutional neural network model for link sign prediction in SBGs. In particular, GegenNet achieves enhanced model capacity and high predictive accuracy through three main technical contributions: (i) fast and theoretically grounded spectral decomposition techniques for node feature initialization; (ii) a new spectral graph filter based on the Gegenbauer polynomial basis; and (iii) multi-layer sign-aware spectral convolutional networks alternating Gegenbauer polynomial filters with positive and negative edges. Our extensive empirical studies reveal that GegenNet can achieve significantly superior performance (up to a gain of 4.28% in AUC and 11.69% in F1) in link sign prediction compared to 11 strong competitors over 6 benchmark SBG datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages.

From a perspective of graph signal processing, we find that graph Laplacian with a negative correction can derive graph frequencies beyond the conventional range $[0, 2]$. To explore whether the low-frequency information beyond this range can encode more informative properties about community structures, we propose InfraredGP. It (\romannumeral1) adopts a spectral GNN as its backbone combined with low-pass filters and a negative correction mechanism, (\romannumeral2) only feeds random inputs to this backbone, (\romannumeral3) derives graph embeddings via one feed-forward propagation (FFP) without any training, and (\romannumeral4) obtains feasible GP results by feeding the derived embeddings to BIRCH. Surprisingly, our experiments demonstrate that based solely on the negative correction mechanism that amplifies low-frequency information beyond $[0, 2]$, InfraredGP can derive distinguishable embeddings for some standard clustering modules (e.g., BIRCH) and obtain high-quality results for GP without any training. Following the IEEE HPEC Graph Challenge benchmark, we evaluate InfraredGP for both static and streaming GP, where InfraredGP can achieve much better efficiency (e.g., 16x-23x faster) and competitive quality over various baselines. We have made our code public at https://github.com/KuroginQin/InfraredGP</p></details> |  |

Existing supervised and weakly supervised solutions often rely on extensive annotated datasets and high-capacity models, making them computationally intensive and less adaptable to real-world scenarios. In this work, we introduce a lightweight and unsupervised skeleton-based action localization pipeline that leverages spatio-temporal graph neural representations. Our approach pre-trains an Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ASTGCN) on a pose-sequence denoising task with blockwise partitions, enabling it to learn intrinsic motion dynamics without any manual labeling. At inference, we define a novel Action Dynamics Metric (ADM), computed directly from low-dimensional ASTGCN embeddings, which detects motion boundaries by identifying inflection points in its curvature profile. Our method achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.66% and average localization latency of 29.09 ms on the DSV Diving dataset, matching state-of-the-art supervised performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Furthermore, it generalizes robustly to unseen, in-the-wild diving footage without retraining, demonstrating its practical applicability for lightweight, real-time action analysis systems in embedded or dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at the ICIP Satellite Workshop 2025</p></details> |
| **[GIMS: Image Matching System Based on Adaptive Graph Construction and Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18221v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature-based image matching has extensive applications in computer vision. Keypoints detected in images can be naturally represented as graph structures, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been shown to outperform traditional deep learning techniques. Consequently, the paradigm of image matching via GNNs has gained significant prominence in recent academic research. In this paper, we first introduce an innovative adaptive graph construction method that utilizes a filtering mechanism based on distance and dynamic threshold similarity. This method dynamically adjusts the criteria for incorporating new vertices based on the characteristics of existing vertices, allowing for the construction of more precise and robust graph structures while avoiding redundancy. We further combine the vertex processing capabilities of GNNs with the global awareness capabilities of Transformers to enhance the model's representation of spatial and feature information within graph structures. This hybrid model provides a deeper understanding of the interrelationships between vertices and their contributions to the matching process. Additionally, we employ the Sinkhorn algorithm to iteratively solve for optimal matching results. Finally, we validate our system using extensive image datasets and conduct comprehensive comparative experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that our system achieves an average improvement of 3.8x-40.3x in overall matching performance. Additionally, the number of vertices and edges significantly impacts training efficiency and memory usage; therefore, we employ multi-GPU technology to accelerate the training process.

| **[Leveraging Multi-facet Paths for Heterogeneous Graph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20648v4)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) and heterogeneous GNNs (HGNNs) have advanced node embeddings and relationship learning for various tasks. However, existing methods often rely on domain-specific predefined meta-paths, which are coarse-grained and focus solely on aspects like node type, limiting their ability to capture complex interactions. We introduce MF2Vec, a model that uses multi-faceted (fine-grained) paths instead of predefined meta-paths. MF2Vec extracts paths via random walks and generates multi-faceted vectors, ignoring predefined schemas. This method learns diverse aspects of nodes and their relationships, constructs a homogeneous network, and creates node embeddings for classification, link prediction, and clustering. Extensive experiments show that MF2Vec outperforms existing methods, offering a more flexible and comprehensive framework for analyzing complex networks. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MF2Vec-6ABC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Efficiency of Sampling-based Motion Planning via Message-Passing Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03909v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling-based motion planning methods, while effective in high-dimensional spaces, often suffer from inefficiencies due to irregular sampling distributions, leading to suboptimal exploration of the configuration space. In this paper, we propose an approach that enhances the efficiency of these methods by utilizing low-discrepancy distributions generated through Message-Passing Monte Carlo (MPMC). MPMC leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generate point sets that uniformly cover the space, with uniformity assessed using the the $\cL_p$-discrepancy measure, which quantifies the irregularity of sample distributions. By improving the uniformity of the point sets, our approach significantly reduces computational overhead and the number of samples required for solving motion planning problems. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional sampling techniques in terms of planning efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecasting Multivariate Urban Data via Decomposition and Spatio-Temporal Graph Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22474v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term forecasting of multivariate urban data poses a significant challenge due to the complex spatiotemporal dependencies inherent in such datasets. This paper presents DST, a novel multivariate time-series forecasting model that integrates graph attention and temporal convolution within a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to effectively capture spatial and temporal dependencies, respectively. To enhance model performance, we apply a decomposition-based preprocessing step that isolates trend, seasonal, and residual components of the time series, enabling the learning of distinct graph structures for different time-series components. Extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets, including electricity demand, weather metrics, carbon intensity, and air pollution, demonstrate the effectiveness of DST across a range of forecast horizons, from several days to one month. Specifically, our approach achieves an average improvement of 2.89% to 9.10% in long-term forecasting accuracy over state-of-the-art time-series forecasting models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Network-Based Topology Optimization for Self-Supporting Structures in Additive Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19169v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a machine learning-based framework for topology optimization of self-supporting structures, specifically tailored for additive manufacturing (AM). By employing a graph neural network (GNN) that acts as a neural field over the finite element mesh, the framework effectively learns and predicts continuous material distributions. An integrated AM filter ensures printability by eliminating unsupported overhangs, while the optimization process minimizes structural compliance under volume and stress constraints. The stress constraint is enforced using a differentiable p-norm aggregation of von Mises stress, promoting mechanical reliability in the optimized designs. A key advantage of the approach lies in its fully differentiable architecture, which leverages automatic differentiation throughout the optimization loop--eliminating the need for explicit sensitivity derivation for both the filter and the stress constraint. Numerical experiments demonstrate the ability of the framework to generate stress-constrained manufacturable topologies under various loading and boundary conditions, offering a practical pathway toward AM-ready high-performance designs with reduced post-processing requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[MCI-GRU: Stock Prediction Model Based on Multi-Head Cross-Attention and Improved GRU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20679v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As financial markets grow increasingly complex in the big data era, accurate stock prediction has become more critical. Traditional time series models, such as GRUs, have been widely used but often struggle to capture the intricate nonlinear dynamics of markets, particularly in the flexible selection and effective utilization of key historical information. Recently, methods like Graph Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning have shown promise in stock prediction but require high data quality and quantity, and they tend to exhibit instability when dealing with data sparsity and noise. Moreover, the training and inference processes for these models are typically complex and computationally expensive, limiting their broad deployment in practical applications. Existing approaches also generally struggle to capture unobservable latent market states effectively, such as market sentiment and expectations, microstructural factors, and participant behavior patterns, leading to an inadequate understanding of market dynamics and subsequently impact prediction accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a stock prediction model, MCI-GRU, based on a multi-head cross-attention mechanism and an improved GRU. First, we enhance the GRU model by replacing the reset gate with an attention mechanism, thereby increasing the model's flexibility in selecting and utilizing historical information. Second, we design a multi-head cross-attention mechanism for learning unobservable latent market state representations, which are further enriched through interactions with both temporal features and cross-sectional features. Finally, extensive experiments on four main stock markets show that the proposed method outperforms SOTA techniques across multiple metrics. Additionally, its successful application in real-world fund management operations confirms its effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated discovery of finite volume schemes using Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19052v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have deeply modified the landscape of numerical simulations by demonstrating strong capabilities in approximating solutions of physical systems. However, their ability to extrapolate beyond their training domain (\textit{e.g.} larger or structurally different graphs) remains uncertain. In this work, we establish that GNNs can serve purposes beyond their traditional role, and be exploited to generate numerical schemes, in conjunction with symbolic regression. First, we show numerically and theoretically that a GNN trained on a dataset consisting solely of two-node graphs can extrapolate a first-order Finite Volume (FV) scheme for the heat equation on out-of-distribution, unstructured meshes. Specifically, if a GNN achieves a loss $\varepsilon$ on such a dataset, it implements the FV scheme with an error of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$. Using symbolic regression, we show that the network effectively rediscovers the exact analytical formulation of the standard first-order FV scheme. We then extend this approach to an unsupervised context: the GNN recovers the first-order FV scheme using only a residual loss similar to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with no access to ground-truth data. Finally, we push the methodology further by considering higher-order schemes: we train (i) a 2-hop and (ii) a 2-layers GNN using the same PINN loss, that autonomously discover (i) a second-order correction term to the initial scheme using a 2-hop stencil, and (ii) the classic second-order midpoint scheme. These findings follows a recent paradigm in scientific computing: GNNs are not only strong approximators, but can be active contributors to the development of novel numerical methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[VISION: Robust and Interpretable Code Vulnerability Detection Leveraging Counterfactual Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18933v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential cybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner. However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset. Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to 97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20 vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalization, Expressivity, and Universality of Graph Neural Networks on Attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05464v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyze the universality and generalization of graph neural networks (GNNs) on attributed graphs, i.e., with node attributes. To this end, we propose pseudometrics over the space of all attributed graphs that describe the fine-grained expressivity of GNNs. Namely, GNNs are both Lipschitz continuous with respect to our pseudometrics and can separate attributed graphs that are distant in the metric. Moreover, we prove that the space of all attributed graphs is relatively compact with respect to our metrics. Based on these properties, we prove a universal approximation theorem for GNNs and generalization bounds for GNNs on any data distribution of attributed graphs. The proposed metrics compute the similarity between the structures of attributed graphs via a hierarchical optimal transport between computation trees. Our work extends and unites previous approaches which either derived theory only for graphs with no attributes, derived compact metrics under which GNNs are continuous but without separation power, or derived metrics under which GNNs are continuous and separate points but the space of graphs is not relatively compact, which prevents universal approximation and generalization analysis.</p></details> |  |

Based on extensions of standard results in graphon analysis to graphon-signals, the paper proved a generalization bound and a sampling lemma for MPNNs. However, there are some missing ingredients in that paper, limiting its applicability in practical settings of graph machine learning. In the current paper, we introduce several refinements and extensions to existing results that address these shortcomings. In detail, 1) we extend the main results in the paper to graphon-signals with multidimensional signals (rather than 1D signals), 2) we extend the Lipschitz continuity to MPNNs with readout with respect to cut distance (rather than MPNNs without readout with respect to cut metric), 3) we improve the generalization bound by utilizing robustness-type generalization bounds, and 4) we extend the analysis to non-symmetric graphons and kernels.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a new graph representation that explicitly captures action information and propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture augmented with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to learn action rankings. Unlike value-function based approaches that must learn a globally consistent function, our action ranking method only needs to learn locally consistent ranking, which is more sample-efficient. Our model is trained on data generated from small problem instances that are easily solved by planners and is applied to significantly larger instances where planning is computationally prohibitive. Experimental results across standard planning benchmarks demonstrate that our action-ranking approach not only achieves better generalization to larger problems than those used in training but also outperforms multiple baseline (value function and action ranking) methods in terms of success rate and plan quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 Pag...</summary><p>6 Pages, 1 figure.

However, existing 3D world models are primarily limited to single-material dynamics using a particle-based Graph Neural Network model, and often require time-consuming 3D scene reconstruction to obtain 3D particle tracks for training. In this work, we present ParticleFormer, a Transformer-based point cloud world model trained with a hybrid point cloud reconstruction loss, supervising both global and local dynamics features in multi-material, multi-object robot interactions. ParticleFormer captures fine-grained multi-object interactions between rigid, deformable, and flexible materials, trained directly from real-world robot perception data without an elaborate scene reconstruction. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness both in 3D scene forecasting tasks, and in downstream manipulation tasks using a Model Predictive Control (MPC) policy. In addition, we extend existing dynamics learning benchmarks to include diverse multi-material, multi-object interaction scenarios. We validate our method on six simulation and three real-world experiments, where it consistently outperforms leading baselines by achieving superior dynamics prediction accuracy and less rollout error in downstream visuomotor tasks.

Preserving this equivalence, GNNs can universally approximate any target function on graphs in probability up to any precision. However, these results are limited to attributed discrete-dynamic graphs represented as sequences of connected graph snapshots. Real-world systems, such as communication networks, financial transaction networks, and molecular interactions, evolve asynchronously and may split into disconnected components. In this paper, we extend the theory of attributed discrete-dynamic graphs to attributed continuous-time dynamic graphs with arbitrary connectivity. To this end, we introduce a continuous-time dynamic 1-WL test, prove its equivalence to continuous-time dynamic unfolding trees, and identify a class of continuous-time dynamic GNNs (CGNNs) based on discrete-dynamic GNN architectures that retain both distinguishing power and universal approximation guarantees. Our constructive proofs further yield practical design guidelines, emphasizing a compact and expressive CGNN architecture with piece-wise continuously differentiable temporal functions to process asynchronous, disconnected graphs.</p></details> |  |

These architectures have inspired numerous enhancements, including multigrid approaches and $K$-hop aggregation (using neighbours of distance $K$), yet they often introduce significant complexity and suffer from limited in-depth investigations. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel Graph Transformer architecture that leverages the adjacency matrix as an attention mask. The proposed approach incorporates innovative augmentations, including Dilated Sliding Windows and Global Attention, to extend receptive fields without sacrificing computational efficiency. Through extensive experimentation, we evaluate model size, adjacency matrix augmentations, positional encoding and $K$-hop configurations using challenging 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) datasets. We also train over 60 models to find a scaling law between training FLOPs and parameters. The introduced models demonstrate remarkable scalability, performing on meshes with up to 300k nodes and 3 million edges. Notably, the smallest model achieves parity with MeshGraphNet while being $7\times$ faster and $6\times$ smaller. The largest model surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by $38.8$\% on average and outperforms MeshGraphNet by $52$\% on the all-rollout RMSE, while having a similar training speed.

However, their performance in multi-agent path finding (MAPF) tasks has been less than satisfactory, with only a few studies exploring this area. MAPF is a complex problem requiring both planning and multi-agent coordination. To improve the performance of LLM in MAPF tasks, we propose a novel framework, LLM-NAR, which leverages neural algorithmic reasoners (NAR) to inform LLM for MAPF. LLM-NAR consists of three key components: an LLM for MAPF, a pre-trained graph neural network-based NAR, and a cross-attention mechanism. This is the first work to propose using a neural algorithmic reasoner to integrate GNNs with the map information for MAPF, thereby guiding LLM to achieve superior performance. LLM-NAR can be easily adapted to various LLM models.

However, existing spiking GNNs predominantly operate in Euclidean space and rely on fixed geometric assumptions, limiting their capacity to model complex graph structures such as hierarchies and cycles. To overcome these limitations, we propose \method{}, a novel Geometry-Aware Spiking Graph Neural Network that unifies spike-based neural dynamics with adaptive representation learning on Riemannian manifolds. \method{} features three key components: a Riemannian Embedding Layer that projects node features into a pool of constant-curvature manifolds, capturing non-Euclidean structures; a Manifold Spiking Layer that models membrane potential evolution and spiking behavior in curved spaces via geometry-consistent neighbor aggregation and curvature-based attention; and a Manifold Learning Objective that enables instance-wise geometry adaptation through jointly optimized classification and link prediction losses defined over geodesic distances. All modules are trained using Riemannian SGD, eliminating the need for backpropagation through time. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that GSG achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and energy efficiency compared to both Euclidean SNNs and manifold-based GNNs, establishing a new paradigm for curvature-aware, energy-efficient graph learning.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose S$^2$G-Net, a novel neural architecture that unifies state-space sequence modeling with multi-view Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for ICU LOS prediction. The temporal path employs Mamba state-space models (SSMs) to capture patient trajectories, while the graph path leverages an optimized GraphGPS backbone, designed to integrate heterogeneous patient similarity graphs derived from diagnostic, administrative, and semantic features. Experiments on the large-scale MIMIC-IV cohort dataset show that S$^2$G-Net consistently outperforms sequence models (BiLSTM, Mamba, Transformer), graph models (classic GNNs, GraphGPS), and hybrid approaches across all primary metrics. Extensive ablation studies and interpretability analyses highlight the complementary contributions of each component of our architecture and underscore the importance of principled graph construction. These results demonstrate that S$^2$G-Net provides an effective and scalable solution for ICU LOS prediction with multi-modal clinical data.</p></details> |  |

Traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often require re-training for different graph tasks and datasets. Although the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced new paradigms in natural language processing, their potential for generic graph mining, training a single model to simultaneously handle diverse tasks and datasets, remains under-explored. To this end, our novel framework MuseGraph, seamlessly integrates the strengths of GNNs and LLMs into one foundation model for graph mining across tasks and datasets. This framework first features a compact graph description to encapsulate key graph information within language token limitations.

Finally, we design a graph-aware instruction tuning strategy to facilitate mutual enhancement across multiple tasks and datasets while preventing catastrophic forgetting of LLMs' generative abilities. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in five graph tasks and ten datasets, showcasing the potential of our MuseGraph in enhancing the accuracy of graph-oriented downstream tasks while improving the generation abilities of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI 2025</p></details> |
| **[HMAE: Self-Supervised Few-Shot Learning for Quantum Spin Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03140v2)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum machine learning for spin and molecular systems faces critical challenges of scarce labeled data and computationally expensive simulations. To address these limitations, we introduce Hamiltonian-Masked Autoencoding (HMAE), a novel self-supervised framework that pre-trains transformers on unlabeled quantum Hamiltonians, enabling efficient few-shot transfer learning. Unlike random masking approaches, HMAE employs a physics-informed strategy based on quantum information theory to selectively mask Hamiltonian terms based on their physical significance. Experiments on 12,500 quantum Hamiltonians (60% real-world, 40% synthetic) demonstrate that HMAE achieves 85.3% $\pm$ 1.5% accuracy in phase classification and 0.15 $\pm$ 0.02 eV MAE in ground state energy prediction with merely 10 labeled examples - a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.01) over classical graph neural networks (78.1% $\pm$ 2.1%) and quantum neural networks (76.8% $\pm$ 2.3%). Our method's primary advantage is exceptional sample efficiency - reducing required labeled examples by 3-5x compared to baseline methods - though we emphasize that ground truth values for fine-tuning and evaluation still require exact diagonalization or tensor networks. We explicitly acknowledge that our current approach is limited to small quantum systems (specifically limited to 12 qubits during training, with limited extension to 16-20 qubits in testing) and that, while promising within this regime, this size restriction prevents immediate application to larger systems of practical interest in materials science and quantum chemistry.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equivariant Spherical Transformer for Efficient Molecular Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23086v2)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SE(3)-equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced molecular system modeling by employing group representations. However, their message passing processes, which rely on tensor product-based convolutions, are limited by insufficient non-linearity and incomplete group representations, thereby restricting expressiveness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Equivariant Spherical Transformer (EST), a novel framework that leverages a Transformer structure within the spatial domain of group representations after Fourier transform. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that EST can encompass the function space of tensor products while achieving superior expressiveness. Furthermore, EST's equivariant inductive bias is guaranteed through a uniform sampling strategy for the Fourier transform. Our experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance by EST on various molecular benchmarks, including OC20 and QM9.</p></details> | 24 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Scaling Graph Transformers: A Comparative Study of Sparse and Dense Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17175v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs have become a central representation in machine learning for capturing relational and structured data across various domains. Traditional graph neural networks often struggle to capture long-range dependencies between nodes due to their local structure. Graph transformers overcome this by using attention mechanisms that allow nodes to exchange information globally. However, there are two types of attention in graph transformers: dense and sparse. In this paper, we compare these two attention mechanisms, analyze their trade-offs, and highlight when to use each. We also outline current challenges and problems in designing attention for graph transformers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two Birds with One Stone: Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification and Interpretability with Graph Functional Neural Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17097v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools on graph data. However, their predictions are mis-calibrated and lack interpretability, limiting their adoption in critical applications. To address this issue, we propose a new uncertainty-aware and interpretable graph classification model that combines graph functional neural process and graph generative model. The core of our method is to assume a set of latent rationales which can be mapped to a probabilistic embedding space; the predictive distribution of the classifier is conditioned on such rationale embeddings by learning a stochastic correlation matrix. The graph generator serves to decode the graph structure of the rationales from the embedding space for model interpretability. For efficient model training, we adopt an alternating optimization procedure which mimics the well known Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed method is general and can be applied to any existing GNN architecture. Extensive experiments on five graph classification datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both uncertainty quantification and GNN interpretability. We also conduct case studies to show that the decoded rationale structure can provide meaningful explanations.</p></details> | AISTATS'25 |
