| **[Training-Free Generative Modeling via Kernelized Stochastic Interpolants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20070v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a kernel method for generative modeling within the stochastic interpolant framework, replacing neural network training with linear systems. The drift of the generative SDE is $\hat b_t(x) = \nablaφ(x)^\topη_t$, where $η_t\in\R^P$ solves a $P\times P$ system computable from data, with $P$ independent of the data dimension $d$. Since estimates are inexact, the diffusion coefficient $D_t$ affects sample quality; the optimal $D_t^*$ from Girsanov diverges at $t=0$, but this poses no difficulty and we develop an integrator that handles it seamlessly. The framework accommodates diverse feature maps -- scattering transforms, pretrained generative models etc. -- enabling training-free generation and model combination. We demonstrate the approach on financial time series, turbulence, and image generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized dynamic functional principal component analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16024v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we explore dimension reduction for functional time series. We propose a generalized dynamic functional principal component analysis (GDFPCA) which does not rely on spectral density estimation and demonstrates strong empirical performance for both stationary and nonstationary functional time series. We define the generalized dynamic functional principal components (GDFPCs) as static factor time series in a functional dynamic factor model and obtain their multivariate representation from a truncation of the functional dynamic factor model. Estimation is based on a least-squares reconstruction criterion and implemented via a two-step procedure for the coefficient vectors of the loading curves under a basis expansion. We establish mean-square consistency of the reconstructed functional time series under weak stationarity. Simulation studies show that GDFPCA performs comparably to dynamic functional principal component analysis (DFPCA) for stationary data, while providing improved reconstruction accuracy in nonstationary settings, where both DFPCA and functional principal component analysis (FPCA) deteriorate. Applications to real datasets support the empirical advantages observed in the simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Change point analysis of high-dimensional data using random projections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19988v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper develops a novel change point identification method for high-dimensional data using random projections. By projecting high-dimensional time series into a one-dimensional space, we are able to leverage the rich literature for univariate time series. We propose applying random projections multiple times and then combining the univariate test results using existing multiple comparison methods. Simulation results suggest that the proposed method tends to have better size and power, with more accurate location estimation. At the same time, random projections may introduce variability in the estimated locations. To enhance stability in practice, we recommend repeating the procedure, and using the mode of the estimated locations as a guide for the final change point estimate. An application to an Australian temperature dataset is presented. This study, though limited to the single change point setting, demonstrates the usefulness of random projections in change point analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multivariate time-series forecasting of ASTRI-Horn monitoring data: A Normal Behavior Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19984v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a Normal Behavior Model (NBM) developed to forecast monitoring time-series data from the ASTRI-Horn Cherenkov telescope under normal operating conditions. The analysis focused on 15 physical variables acquired by the Telescope Control Unit between September 2022 and July 2024, representing sensor measurements from the Azimuth and Elevation motors. After data cleaning, resampling, feature selection, and correlation analysis, the dataset was segmented into fixed-length intervals, in which the first I samples represented the input sequence provided to the model, while the forecast length, T, indicated the number of future time steps to be predicted. A sliding-window technique was then applied to increase the number of intervals. A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) was trained to perform multivariate forecasting across all features simultaneously. Model performance was evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the Normalized Median Absolute Deviation (NMAD), and it was also benchmarked against a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The MLP model demonstrated consistent results across different features and I-T configurations, and matched the performance of the LSTM while converging faster. It achieved an MSE of 0.019+/-0.003 and an NMAD of 0.032+/-0.009 on the test set under its best configuration (4 hidden layers, 720 units per layer, and I-T lengths of 300 samples each, corresponding to 5 hours at 1-minute resolution). Extending the forecast horizon up to 6.5 hours-the maximum allowed by this configuration-did not degrade performance, confirming the model's effectiveness in providing reliable hour-scale predictions. The proposed NBM provides a powerful tool for enabling early anomaly detection in online ASTRI-Horn monitoring time series, offering a basis for the future development of a prognostics and health management system that supports predictive maintenance.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12 figures |
| **[A Two-Step Spatio-Temporal Framework for Turbine-Height Wind Estimation at Unmonitored Sites from Sparse Meteorological Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19954v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate estimates of wind speeds at wind turbine hub heights are crucial for both wind resource assessment and day-to-day management of electricity grids with high renewable penetration. In the absence of direct measurements, parametric models are commonly used to extrapolate wind speeds from observed heights to turbine heights. Recent literature has proposed extensions to allow for spatially or temporally varying vertical wind gradients, that is, the rate at which wind speed changes with height. However, these approaches typically assume that reference height and hub height measurements are available at the same locations, which limits their applicability in operational settings where meteorological stations and wind farms are spatially separated. In this paper, we develop a two-step spatio-temporal framework to estimate turbine height wind speeds using only open-access observations from sparse meteorological stations. First, a non-parametric generalized additive model is trained on reanalysis data to perform vertical height extrapolation. Second, a spatial Gaussian process model interpolates these hub-height estimates to wind farm locations while explicitly propagating uncertainty from the height extrapolation stage. The proposed framework enables the construction of high-resolution, sub-hourly turbine-height wind speed time series and spatial wind maps using data available in real time, capabilities not provided by existing reanalysis products. We further provide calibrated uncertainty estimates that account for both vertical extrapolation and spatial interpolation errors. The approach is validated using hub-height measurements from seven operational wind farms in Ireland, demonstrating improved accuracy relative to ERA5 reanalysis while relying solely on real-time, open-access data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anomaly detection for generic failure monitoring in robotic assembly, screwing and manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26308v3)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution states in robot manipulation often lead to unpredictable robot behavior or task failure, limiting success rates and increasing risk of damage. Anomaly detection (AD) can identify deviations from expected patterns in data, which can be used to trigger failsafe behaviors and recovery strategies. Prior work has applied data-driven AD on time series data for specific robotic tasks, however the transferability of an AD approach between different robot control strategies and task types has not been shown. Leveraging time series data, such as force/torque signals, allows to directly capture robot-environment interactions, crucial for manipulation and online failure detection. As robotic tasks can have widely signal characteristics and requirements, AD methods which can be applied in the same way to a wide range of tasks is needed, ideally with good data efficiency. We examine three industrial robotic tasks, robotic cabling, screwing, and sanding, each with multi-modal time series data and several anomalies. Several autoencoderbased methods are compared, and we evaluate the generalization across different robotic tasks and control methods (diffusion policy-, position-, and impedance-controlled). This allows us to validate the integration of AD in complex tasks involving tighter tolerances and variation from both the robot and its environment. Additionally, we evaluate data efficiency, detection latency, and task characteristics which support robust detection. The results indicate reliable detection with AUROC exceeding 0.96 in failures in the cabling and screwing task, such as incorrect or misaligned parts and obstructed targets. In the polishing task, only severe failures were reliably detected, while more subtle failure types remained undetected.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables, the paper has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |
| **[Aurora: Towards Universal Generative Multimodal Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22295v5)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain generalization is very important in Time Series Forecasting because similar historical information may lead to distinct future trends due to the domain-specific characteristics. Recent works focus on building unimodal time series foundation models and end-to-end multimodal supervised models. Since domain-specific knowledge is often contained in modalities like texts, the former lacks the explicit utilization of them, thus hindering the performance. The latter is tailored for end-to-end scenarios and does not support zero-shot inference for cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we introduce Aurora, a Multimodal Time Series Foundation Model, which supports multimodal inputs and zero-shot inference. Pretrained on Cross-domain Multimodal Time Series Corpus, Aurora can adaptively extract and focus on key domain knowledge contained in corresponding text or image modalities, thus possessing strong cross-domain generalization capability. Through tokenization, encoding, and distillation, Aurora can extract multimodal domain knowledge as guidance and then utilizes a Modality-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention to inject them into the modeling of temporal representations. In the decoding phase, the multimodal representations are used to generate the conditions and prototypes of future tokens, contributing to a novel Prototype-Guided Flow Matching for generative probabilistic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on 5 well-recognized benchmarks, including TimeMMD, TSFM-Bench, ProbTS, TFB, and EPF, demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of Aurora on both unimodal and multimodal scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Chi-Square Method can model and forecast complex time series, like El Nino data between 1870 and 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01540v6)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting El Nino is one of the greatest challenges of science. We show how intensive, large and accurate time series allow us to see through time. Our Discrete Chi-square Method (DCM) can detect arbitrary trend and signal(-s) combinations. It can forecast complex time series. The widely-used Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and other frequency-domain parametric time series analysis methods have many application limitations. None of those limitations constrains the DCM. Our simulated time series analyses ascertain the revolutionary Window Dimension Effect (WDE): "For any sample window $ΔT$, DCM inevitably detects the correct $p(t)$ trend and $h(t)$ signal(-s) when the sample size $n$ and/or data accuracy $σ$ increase." The simulations also expose the DFT's weaknesses and the DCM's efficiency. The DCM's backbone is the Gauß-Markov theorem that the Least Squares (LS) is the best unbiased estimator for linear regression models. DCM can not fail because this simple method is based on the computation of a massive number of linear model LS fits. The Fisher-test gives the signal significance estimates and identifies the best DCM model from all alternative tested DCM models. The analytical solution for the non-linear DCM model is an ill-posed problem. We present a computational well-posed solution. The best DCM model must be correct if it passes our Forecast-test.Our DCM is ideal for forecasting because its WDE spearhead is robust against short sample windows and complex time series. In our appendix, we show that the DCM can model and forecast El Nino data between 1870 and 2024. An immediate, independent and objective validity check of our analysis may save some money.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Statistical Approach for Modeling Irregular Multivariate Time Series with Missing Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19531v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular multivariate time series with missing values present significant challenges for predictive modeling in domains such as healthcare. While deep learning approaches often focus on temporal interpolation or complex architectures to handle irregularities, we propose a simpler yet effective alternative: extracting time-agnostic summary statistics to eliminate the temporal axis. Our method computes four key features per variable-mean and standard deviation of observed values, as well as the mean and variability of changes between consecutive observations to create a fixed-dimensional representation. These features are then utilized with standard classifiers, such as logistic regression and XGBoost. Evaluated on four biomedical datasets (PhysioNet Challenge 2012, 2019, PAMAP2, and MIMIC-III), our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing recent transformer and graph-based models by 0.5-1.7% in AUROC/AUPRC and 1.1-1.7% in accuracy/F1-score, while reducing computational complexity. Ablation studies demonstrate that feature extraction-not classifier choice-drives performance gains, and our summary statistics outperform raw/imputed input in most benchmarks. In particular, we identify scenarios where missing patterns themselves encode predictive signals, as in sepsis prediction (PhysioNet, 2019), where missing indicators alone can achieve 94.2% AUROC with XGBoost, only 1.6% lower than using original raw data as input. Our results challenge the necessity of complex temporal modeling when task objectives permit time-agnostic representations, providing an efficient and interpretable solution for irregular time series classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in APSIPA Transactions on Signal and Information Processing</p></details> |
| **[Real-time Win Probability and Latent Player Ability via STATS X in Team Sports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19513v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study proposes a statistically grounded framework for real-time win probability evaluation and player assessment in score-based team sports, based on minute-by-minute cumulative box-score data. We introduce a continuous dominance indicator (T-score) that maps final scores to real values consistent with win/lose outcomes, and formulate it as a time-evolving stochastic representation (T-process) driven by standardized cumulative statistics. This structure captures temporal game dynamics and enables sequential, analytically tractable updates of in-game win probability. Through this stochastic formulation, competitive advantage is decomposed into interpretable statistical components. Furthermore, we define a latent contribution index, STATS X, which quantifies a player's involvement in favorable dominance intervals identified by the T-process. This allows us to separate a team's baseline strength from game-specific performance fluctuations and provides a coherent, structural evaluation framework for both teams and players. While we do not implement AI methods in this paper, our framework is positioned as a foundational step toward hybrid integration with AI. By providing a structured time-series representation of dominance with an explicit probabilistic interpretation, the framework enables flexible learning mechanisms and incorporation of high-dimensional data, while preserving statistical coherence and interpretability. This work provides a basis for advancing AI-driven sports analytics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-Guided Agentic AI for Multimodal Clinical Prediction: Lessons from the AgentDS Healthcare Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19502v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic AI systems are increasingly capable of autonomous data science workflows, yet clinical prediction tasks demand domain expertise that purely automated approaches struggle to provide. We investigate how human guidance of agentic AI can improve multimodal clinical prediction, presenting our approach to all three AgentDS Healthcare benchmark challenges: 30-day hospital readmission prediction (Macro-F1 = 0.8986), emergency department cost forecasting (MAE = $465.13), and discharge readiness assessment (Macro-F1 = 0.7939). Across these tasks, human analysts directed the agentic workflow at key decision points, multimodal feature engineering from clinical notes, scanned PDF billing receipts, and time-series vital signs; task-appropriate model selection; and clinically informed validation strategies. Our approach ranked 5th overall in the healthcare domain, with a 3rd-place finish on the discharge readiness task. Ablation studies reveal that human-guided decisions compounded to a cumulative gain of +0.065 F1 over automated baselines, with multimodal feature extraction contributing the largest single improvement (+0.041 F1). We distill three generalizable lessons: (1) domain-informed feature engineering at each pipeline stage yields compounding gains that outperform extensive automated search; (2) multimodal data integration requires task-specific human judgment that no single extraction strategy generalizes across clinical text, PDFs, and time-series; and (3) deliberate ensemble diversity with clinically motivated model configurations outperforms random hyperparameter search. These findings offer practical guidance for teams deploying agentic AI in healthcare settings where interpretability, reproducibility, and clinical validity are essential.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Data Challenge track at the 14th IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI) 2026</p></details> |
| **[SenTSR-Bench: Thinking with Injected Knowledge for Time-Series Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19455v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series diagnostic reasoning is essential for many applications, yet existing solutions face a persistent gap: general reasoning large language models (GRLMs) possess strong reasoning skills but lack the domain-specific knowledge to understand complex time-series patterns. Conversely, fine-tuned time-series LLMs (TSLMs) understand these patterns but lack the capacity to generalize reasoning for more complicated questions. To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid knowledge-injection framework that injects TSLM-generated insights directly into GRLM's reasoning trace, thereby achieving strong time-series reasoning with in-domain knowledge. As collecting data for knowledge injection fine-tuning is costly, we further leverage a reinforcement learning-based approach with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit knowledge-rich traces without human supervision, then transfer such an in-domain thinking trace into GRLM for efficient knowledge injection. We further release SenTSR-Bench, a multivariate time-series-based diagnostic reasoning benchmark collected from real-world industrial operations. Across SenTSR-Bench and other public datasets, our method consistently surpasses TSLMs by 9.1%-26.1% and GRLMs by 7.9%-22.4%, delivering robust, context-aware time-series diagnostic insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 29th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Time Series, Vision, and Language: Exploring the Limits of Alignment in Contrastive Representation Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19367v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Platonic Representation Hypothesis posits that learned representations from models trained on different modalities converge to a shared latent structure of the world. However, this hypothesis has largely been examined in vision and language, and it remains unclear whether time series participate in such convergence. We first examine this in a trimodal setting and find that independently pretrained time series, vision, and language encoders exhibit near-orthogonal geometry in the absence of explicit coupling. We then apply post-hoc alignment by training projection heads over frozen encoders using contrastive learning, and analyze the resulting representations with respect to geometry, scaling behavior, and dependence on information density and input modality characteristics. Our investigation reveals that overall alignment in contrastive representation spaces improves with model size, but this alignment is asymmetric: time series align more strongly with visual representations than with text, and images can act as effective intermediaries between time series and language. We further see that richer textual descriptions improve alignment only up to a threshold; training on denser captions does not lead to further improvement. Analogous effects are observed for visual representations. Our findings shed light on considerations for building multimodal systems involving non-conventional data modalities beyond vision and language.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 Fi...</summary><p>24 Figures, 12 Tables</p></details> |
| **[How Ominous is the Premonition of Future Global Warming?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11175v2)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global warming, the phenomenon of increasing global average temperature in the recent decades, is receiving wide attention due to its very significant adverse effects on climate. Whether global warming will continue even in the future, is a question that is most important to investigate. In this regard, the so-called general circulation models (GCMs) have attempted to project the future climate, and nearly all of them exhibit alarming rates of global temperature rise in the future. Although global warming in the current time frame is undeniable, it is important to assess the validity of the future predictions of the GCMs. In this article, we attempt such a study using our recently-developed Bayesian multiple testing paradigm for model selection in inverse regression problems. The model we assume for the global temperature time series is based on Gaussian process emulation of the black box scenario, realistically treating the dynamic evolution of the time series as unknown. We apply our ideas to datasets available from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) website. The best GCM models selected by our method under different assumptions on future climate change scenarios do not convincingly support the present global warming pattern when only the future predictions are considered known. Using our Gaussian process idea, we also forecast the future temperature time series given the current one. Interestingly, our results do not support drastic future global warming predicted by almost all the GCM models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This updated version will appear in Sankhya B's special issue paying tribute to Professor C.

| **[TimeRadar: A Domain-Rotatable Foundation Model for Time Series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19068v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current time series foundation models (TSFMs) primarily focus on learning prevalent and regular patterns within a predefined time or frequency domain to enable supervised downstream tasks (e.g., forecasting). Consequently, they are often ineffective for inherently unsupervised downstream tasks-such as time series anomaly detection (TSAD), which aims to identify rare, irregular patterns. This limitation arises because such abnormal patterns can closely resemble the regular patterns when presented in the same time/frequency domain. To address this issue, we introduce TimeRadar, an innovative TSFM built in a fractional time-frequency domain to support generalist TSAD across diverse unseen datasets. Our key insight is that rotating a time series into a data-dependent fractional time-frequency representation can adaptively differentiate the normal and abnormal signals across different datasets. To this end, a novel component, namely Fractionally modulated Time-Frequency Reconstruction (FTFRecon), is proposed in TimeRadar to leverage a learnable fractional order to rotate the time series to the most pronounced angle between a continuous time and frequency domain for accurate data reconstruction. This provides adaptive data reconstruction in an optimal time-frequency domain for each data input, enabling effective differentiation of the unbounded abnormal patterns from the regular ones across datasets, including unseen datasets. To allow TimeRadar to model local abnormality that is not captured by the global data reconstruction, we further introduce a Contextual Deviation Learning (CDL) component to model the local deviation of the input relative to its contextual time series data in the rotatable domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Early Multimodal Prediction of Cross-Lingual Meme Virality on Reddit: A Time-Window Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05761v2)** | 2026-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memes are a central part of online culture, yet their virality remains difficult to predict, especially in cross-lingual settings. We present a large-scale, time-series dataset of 46,578 Reddit memes collected from 25 meme-centric subreddits across eight language groups, with more than one million engagement tracking points. We propose a data-driven definition of virality based on a Hybrid Score that normalises engagement by community size and integrates dynamic features such as velocity and acceleration. This approach directly addresses the field's reliance on static, simple volume-based thresholds with arbitrary cut-offs. Building on this target, we construct a multimodal feature set that combines Visual, Textual, Contextual, Network, and Temporal signals, including structured annotations from a multimodal LLM to scale cross-lingual content labelling in a consistent way. We benchmark interpretable baselines (XGBoost, MLP) against end-to-end deep models (BERT, InceptionV3, CLIP) across early observation windows from 30 to 420 minutes. Our best model, a multimodal XGBoost classifier, achieves a PR AUC of 0.43 at 30 minutes and 0.80 at 420 minutes, indicating that early prediction of meme virality is feasible even under strong class imbalance. The results reveal a clear Content Ceiling, where content-only and deep multimodal baselines plateau at low PR AUC, while structural Network and Temporal features are necessary to surpass this limit. A SHAP-based temporal analysis further uncovers an evidentiary transition, where early predictions are dominated by network priors (author and community context), and later predictions increasingly rely on temporal dynamics (velocity, acceleration) as engagement accumulates. Overall, we reframe meme virality as a dynamic, path-dependent process governed by exposure and early interaction patterns rather than by intrinsic content alone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM WebSci 2026. 10 pages, 9 fiures and 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Transformers for dynamical systems learn transfer operators in-context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18679v1)** | 2026-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale foundation models for scientific machine learning adapt to physical settings unseen during training, such as zero-shot transfer between turbulent scales. This phenomenon, in-context learning, challenges conventional understanding of learning and adaptation in physical systems. Here, we study in-context learning of dynamical systems in a minimal setting: we train a small two-layer, single-head transformer to forecast one dynamical system, and then evaluate its ability to forecast a different dynamical system without retraining. We discover an early tradeoff in training between in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance, which manifests as a secondary double descent phenomenon. We discover that attention-based models apply a transfer-operator forecasting strategy in-context. They (1) lift low-dimensional time series using delay embedding, to detect the system's higher-dimensional dynamical manifold, and (2) identify and forecast long-lived invariant sets that characterize the global flow on this manifold. Our results clarify the mechanism enabling large pretrained models to forecast unseen physical systems at test without retraining, and they illustrate the unique ability of attention-based models to leverage global attractor information in service of short-term forecasts.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Large Causal Models for Temporal Causal Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18662v1)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery for both cross-sectional and temporal data has traditionally followed a dataset-specific paradigm, where a new model is fitted for each individual dataset. Such an approach limits the potential of multi-dataset pretraining. The concept of large causal models (LCMs) envisions a class of pre-trained neural architectures specifically designed for temporal causal discovery. Prior approaches are constrained to small variable counts, degrade with larger inputs, and rely heavily on synthetic data, limiting generalization. We propose a principled framework for LCMs, combining diverse synthetic generators with realistic time-series datasets, allowing learning at scale. Extensive experiments on synthetic, semi-synthetic and realistic benchmarks show that LCMs scale effectively to higher variable counts and deeper architectures while maintaining strong performance. Trained models achieve competitive or superior accuracy compared to classical and neural baselines, particularly in out-of-distribution settings, while enabling fast, single-pass inference. Results demonstrate LCMs as a promising foundation-model paradigm for temporal causal discovery. Experiments and model weights are available at https://github.com/kougioulis/LCM-paper/.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages (16 main text, 16 Appendix), 11 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Time Series Reasoning via Segment Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18645v1)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series reasoning tasks often start with a natural language question and require targeted analysis of a time series. Evidence may span the full series or appear in a few short intervals, so the model must decide what to inspect. Most existing approaches encode the entire time series into a fixed representation before inference, regardless of whether or not the entire sequence is relevant. We introduce ARTIST, which formulates time-series reasoning as a sequential decision problem. ARTIST interleaves reasoning with adaptive temporal segment selection. It adopts a controller-reasoner architecture and uses reinforcement learning to train the controller role to select informative segments and the reasoner role to generate segment-conditioned reasoning traces and final answers. During inference, the model actively acquires task-relevant information instead of relying on a static summary of the full sequence. We use a novel hierarchical policy optimization approach for post-training that allows the model to excel in both segment selection and question-answering behavior. We evaluate ARTIST on six time-series reasoning benchmarks and compare it with large language models, vision-language models, and prior time-series reasoning systems. ARTIST improves average accuracy by 6.46 absolute percentage points over the strongest baseline. The largest gains appear on rare event localization and multi-segment reasoning tasks. Supervised fine-tuning improves performance, and reinforcement learning provides additional gains by optimizing question-adaptive segment selection. These results show that selective data use drives effective time-series reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Time Series Causal Discovery for Agent-Based Model Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19412v3)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agent-Based Model (ABM) validation is crucial as it helps ensuring the reliability of simulations, and causal discovery has become a powerful tool in this context. However, current causal discovery methods often face accuracy and robustness challenges when applied to complex and noisy time series data, which is typical in ABM scenarios. This study addresses these issues by proposing a Robust Cross-Validation (RCV) approach to enhance causal structure learning for ABM validation. We develop RCV-VarLiNGAM and RCV-PCMCI, novel extensions of two prominent causal discovery algorithms. These aim to reduce the impact of noise better and give more reliable causal relation results, even with high-dimensional, time-dependent data. The proposed approach is then integrated into an enhanced ABM validation framework, which is designed to handle diverse data and model structures. The approach is evaluated using synthetic datasets and a complex simulated fMRI dataset. The results demonstrate greater reliability in causal structure identification. The study examines how various characteristics of datasets affect the performance of established causal discovery methods. These characteristics include linearity, noise distribution, stationarity, and causal structure density. This analysis is then extended to the RCV method to see how it compares in these different situations. This examination helps confirm whether the results are consistent with existing literature and also reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the novel approaches. By tackling key methodological challenges, the study aims to enhance ABM validation with a more resilient valuation framework presented. These improvements increase the reliability of model-driven decision making processes in complex systems analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>A pee...</summary><p>A peer-reviewed version titled "VCDF: A Validated Consensus-Driven Framework for Time Series Causal Discovery" is accepted to Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD) 2026.

| **[Theory and interpretability of Quantum Extreme Learning Machines: a Pauli-transfer matrix approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18377v1)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum reservoir computers (QRCs) have emerged as a promising approach to quantum machine learning, since they utilize the natural dynamics of quantum systems for data processing and are simple to train. Here, we consider n-qubit quantum extreme learning machines (QELMs) with continuous-time reservoir dynamics. QELMs are memoryless QRCs capable of various ML tasks, including image classification and time series forecasting. We apply the Pauli transfer matrix (PTM) formalism to theoretically analyze the influence of encoding, reservoir dynamics, and measurement operations, including temporal multiplexing, on the QELM performance. This formalism makes explicit that the encoding determines the complete set of (nonlinear) features available to the QELM, while the quantum channels linearly transform these features before they are probed by the chosen measurement operators. Optimizing a QELM can therefore be cast as a decoding problem in which one shapes the channel-induced transformations such that task-relevant features become available to the regressor. The PTM formalism allows one to identify the classical representation of a QELM and thereby guide its design towards a given training objective. As a specific application, we focus on learning nonlinear dynamical systems and show that a QELM trained on such trajectories learns a surrogate-approximation to the underlying flow map.</p></details> | 34 pages, 12 figures |

Existing process-based and data-driven models are either highly sensitive to sparse data or lack the physical interpretability required for climate-critical applications. To address this gap, we introduce PhysE-Inv, a novel framework that integrates a sophisticated sequential architecture, an LSTM Encoder-Decoder with Multi-head Attention and physics-guided contrastive learning, with physics-guided inference.Our core innovation lies in a surjective, physics-constrained inversion methodology. This methodology first leverages the hydrostatic balance forward model as a target-formulation proxy, enabling effective learning in the absence of direct $h_s$ ground truth; second, it uses reconstruction physics regularization over a latent space to dynamically discover hidden physical parameters from noisy, incomplete time-series input. Evaluated against state-of-the-art baselines, PhysE-Inv significantly improves prediction performance, reducing error by 20\% while demonstrating superior physical consistency and resilience to data sparsity compared to empirical methods. This approach pioneers a path for noise-tolerant, interpretable inverse modeling, with wide applicability in geospatial and cryospheric domains.</p></details> |  |

We develop and apply Bayesian Dirichlet autoregressive moving average (BDARMA) models to forecast the compositional dynamics of guest origin market shares using proprietary Airbnb booking data spanning 2017--2024 across four major destination regions. Our analysis reveals substantial pandemic-induced structural breaks in origin composition, with heterogeneous recovery patterns across markets. The BDARMA framework achieves the lowest average forecast error across all destination regions, outperforming standard benchmarks including naïve forecasts, exponential smoothing, and SARIMA on log-ratio transformed data. For EMEA destinations, BDARMA achieves 23% lower forecast error than naive methods, with statistically significant improvements. By modeling compositions directly on the simplex with a Dirichlet likelihood and incorporating seasonal variation in both mean and precision parameters, our approach produces coherent forecasts that respect the unit-sum constraint while capturing complex temporal dependencies. The methodology provides destination stakeholders with probabilistic forecasts of source market shares, enabling more informed strategic planning for marketing resource allocation, infrastructure investment, and crisis response.</p></details> |  |

Understanding and decoding cognitive brain states from fMRI depends on how functional interactions are represented. We propose an ensemble-based graph representation in which each edge weight encodes state evidence as the difference between posterior probabilities of two states, estimated by an ensemble of edge-wise probabilistic classifiers from simple pairwise time-series features. We evaluate the method on seven task-fMRI paradigms from the Human Connectome Project, performing binary classification within each paradigm. Using compact node summaries (mean incident edge weights) and logistic regression, we obtain average accuracies of 97.07-99.74 %. We further compare ensemble graphs with conventional correlation graphs using the same graph neural network classifier; ensemble graphs consistently yield higher accuracy (88.00-99.42 % vs 61.86-97.94 % across tasks). Because edge weights have a probabilistic, state-oriented interpretation, the representation supports connection- and region-level interpretability and can be extended to multiclass decoding, regression, other neuroimaging modalities, and clinical classification.</p></details> |  |

Building on theoretical considerations and empirical stylized facts, our approach utilizes a Poisson random walk model that allows for heavy-tailed innovations or stochastic volatility dynamics, while incorporating an explicit mechanism to separate structural from sampling zeros. Posterior inference is carried out via a straightforward Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Applying this methodology to the Mediterranean and English Channel data, we compare alternative model specifications through a comprehensive out-of-sample density forecasting exercise. Evaluating each model using log predictive scores and empirical coverage up to the 99th percentile, we find strong evidence for stochastic volatility in the migration innovations, with these models producing well-calibrated forecasts even at extreme quantiles. Our framework can be used to develop risk indicators with direct policy implications for improving governance and preparedness for migration surges. More broadly, the methodology extends to other zero-inflated non-stationary count time series applications, including epidemiological surveillance and public safety incident monitoring.</p></details> |  |

Although early models such as Mantis have shown the promise of this approach, a substantial performance gap remained between frozen and fine-tuned encoders. In this work, we introduce methods that significantly strengthen zero-shot feature extraction for time series. First, we introduce Mantis+, a variant of Mantis pre-trained entirely on synthetic time series. Second, through controlled ablation studies, we refine the architecture and obtain MantisV2, an improved and more lightweight encoder. Third, we propose an enhanced test-time methodology that leverages intermediate-layer representations and refines output-token aggregation. In addition, we show that performance can be further improved via self-ensembling and cross-model embedding fusion. Extensive experiments on UCR, UEA, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) benchmarks, and EEG datasets show that MantisV2 and Mantis+ consistently outperform prior time series foundation models, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Financial time series augmentation using transformer based GAN architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17865v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting is a critical task across many domains, from engineering to economics, where accurate predictions drive strategic decisions. However, applying advanced deep learning models in challenging, volatile domains like finance is difficult due to the inherent limitation and dynamic nature of financial time series data. This scarcity often results in sub-optimal model training and poor generalization. The fundamental challenge lies in determining how to reliably augment scarce financial time series data to enhance the predictive accuracy of deep learning forecasting models. Our main contribution is a demonstration of how Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can effectively serve as a data augmentation tool to overcome data scarcity in the financial domain. Specifically, we show that training a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) forecasting model on a dataset augmented with synthetic data generated by a transformer-based GAN (TTS-GAN) significantly improves the forecasting accuracy compared to using real data alone. We confirm these results across different financial time series (Bitcoin and S\&P500 price data) and various forecasting horizons. Furthermore, we propose a novel, time series specific quality metric that combines Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and a modified Deep Dataset Dissimilarity Measure (DeD-iMs) to reliably monitor the training progress and evaluate the quality of the generated data. These findings provide compelling evidence for the benefits of GAN-based data augmentation in enhancing financial predictive capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for the upcoming 18th International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence (ICAART-2026), Marbella, Spain.

| **[Individualized and Interpretable Sleep Forecasting via a Two-Stage Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06974v2)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sleep quality impacts well-being. Therefore, healthcare providers and individuals need accessible and reliable forecasting tools for preventive interventions. This paper introduces an interpretable, individualized adaptive spatial-temporal model for predicting sleep quality. We designed a hierarchical architecture, consisting of parallel 1D convolutions with varying kernel sizes and dilated convolution, which extracts multi-resolution temporal patterns-short kernels capture rapid physiological changes, while larger kernels and dilation model slower trends. The extracted features are then refined through channel attention, which learns to emphasize the most predictive variables for each individual, followed by bidirectional LSTM and self-attention that jointly model both local sequential dynamics and global temporal dependencies. Finally, a two-stage adaptation strategy ensures the learned representations transfer effectively to new users. We conducted various experiments with five input window sizes (3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 days) and five prediction window sizes (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days). Our model consistently outperformed time series forecasting baseline approaches, including LSTM, Informer, PatchTST, and TimesNet. The best performance was achieved with a three-day input window and a one-day prediction window, yielding an RMSE of 0.216. Furthermore, the model demonstrated good predictive performance even for longer forecasting horizons (e.g., with a 0.257 RMSE for a three-day prediction window), highlighting its practical utility for real-world applications. We also conducted an explainability analysis to examine how different features influence sleep quality. These findings proved that the proposed framework offers a robust, adaptive, and explainable solution for personalized sleep forecasting using sparse data from commercial wearable devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaptStress: Online Adaptive Learning for Interpretable and Personalized Stress Prediction Using Multivariate and Sparse Physiological Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18521v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous stress forecasting could potentially contribute to lifestyle interventions. This paper presents a novel, explainable, and individualized approach for stress prediction using physiological data from consumer-grade smartwatches. We develop a time series forecasting model that leverages multivariate features, including heart rate variability, activity patterns, and sleep metrics, to predict stress levels across 16 temporal horizons (History window: 3, 5, 7, 9 days; forecasting window: 1, 3, 5, 7 days). Our evaluation involves 16 participants monitored for 10-15 weeks. We evaluate our approach across 16 participants, comparing against state-of-the-art time series models (Informer, TimesNet, PatchTST) and traditional baselines (CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM) across multiple temporal horizons. Our model achieved performance with an MSE of 0.053, MAE of 0.190, and RMSE of 0.226 in optimal settings (5-day input, 1-day prediction). A comparison with the baseline models shows that our model outperforms TimesNet, PatchTST, CNN-LSTM, LSTM, and CNN under all conditions, representing improvements of 36.9%, 25.5%, and 21.5% over the best baseline. According to the explanability analysis, sleep metrics are the most dominant and consistent stress predictors (importance: 1.1, consistency: 0.9-1.0), while activity features exhibit high inter-participant variability (0.1-0.2). Most notably, the model captures individual-specific patterns where identical features can have opposing effects across users, validating its personalization capabilities. These findings establish that consumer wearables, combined with adaptive and interpretable deep learning, can deliver relevant stress assessment adapted to individual physiological responses, providing a foundation for scalable, continuous, explainable mental health monitoring in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causality by Abstraction: Symbolic Rule Learning in Multivariate Timeseries with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17829v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inferring causal relations in timeseries data with delayed effects is a fundamental challenge, especially when the underlying system exhibits complex dynamics that cannot be captured by simple functional mappings. Traditional approaches often fail to produce generalized and interpretable explanations, as multiple distinct input trajectories may yield nearly indistinguishable outputs. In this work, we present ruleXplain, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract formal explanations for input-output relations in simulation-driven dynamical systems. Our method introduces a constrained symbolic rule language with temporal operators and delay semantics, enabling LLMs to generate verifiable causal rules through structured prompting. ruleXplain relies on the availability of a principled model (e.g., a simulator) that maps multivariate input time series to output time series. Within ruleXplain, the simulator is used to generate diverse counterfactual input trajectories that yield similar target output, serving as candidate explanations. Such counterfactual inputs are clustered and provided as context to the LLM, which is tasked with the generation of symbolic rules encoding the joint temporal trends responsible for the patterns observable in the output times series. A closed-loop refinement process ensures rule consistency and semantic validity. We validate the framework using the PySIRTEM epidemic simulator, mapping testing rate inputs to daily infection counts; and the EnergyPlus building energy simulator, observing temperature and solar irradiance inputs to electricity needs. For validation, we perform three classes of experiments: (1) the efficacy of the ruleset through input reconstruction; (2) ablation studies evaluating the causal encoding of the ruleset; and (3) generalization tests of the extracted rules across unseen output trends with varying phase dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reverso: Efficient Time Series Foundation Models for Zero-shot Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17634v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning time series foundation models has been shown to be a promising approach for zero-shot time series forecasting across diverse time series domains. Insofar as scaling has been a critical driver of performance of foundation models in other modalities such as language and vision, much recent work on time series foundation modeling has focused on scaling. This has resulted in time series foundation models with hundreds of millions of parameters that are, while performant, inefficient and expensive to use in practice. This paper describes a simple recipe for learning efficient foundation models for zero-shot time series forecasting that are orders of magnitude smaller. We show that large-scale transformers are not necessary: small hybrid models that interleave long convolution and linear RNN layers (in particular DeltaNet layers) can match the performance of larger transformer-based models while being more than a hundred times smaller. We also describe several data augmentation and inference strategies that further improve performance. This recipe results in Reverso, a family of efficient time series foundation models for zero-shot forecasting that significantly push the performance-efficiency Pareto frontier.</p></details> |  |
| **[Be Wary of Your Time Series Preprocessing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17568v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Normalization and scaling are fundamental preprocessing steps in time series modeling, yet their role in Transformer-based models remains underexplored from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we present the first formal analysis of how different normalization strategies, specifically instance-based and global scaling, impact the expressivity of Transformer-based architectures for time series representation learning. We propose a novel expressivity framework tailored to time series, which quantifies a model's ability to distinguish between similar and dissimilar inputs in the representation space. Using this framework, we derive theoretical bounds for two widely used normalization methods: Standard and Min-Max scaling. Our analysis reveals that the choice of normalization strategy can significantly influence the model's representational capacity, depending on the task and data characteristics. We complement our theory with empirical validation on classification and forecasting benchmarks using multiple Transformer-based models. Our results show that no single normalization method consistently outperforms others, and in some cases, omitting normalization entirely leads to superior performance. These findings highlight the critical role of preprocessing in time series learning and motivate the need for more principled normalization strategies tailored to specific tasks and datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the AI4TS workshop at AAAI-26</p></details> |
| **[An extension to reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo for change point problems with heterogeneous temporal dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17503v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting brief changes in time-series data remains a major challenge in fields where short-lived states carry meaning. In single-molecule localisation microscopy, this problem is particularly acute as fluorescent molecules used to tag protein oligomers display heterogenous photophysical behaviour that can complicate photobleach step analysis; a key step in resolving nanoscale protein organisation. Existing methods often require extensive filtering or prior calibration, and can fail to accurately account for blinking or reversible dark states that may contaminate downstream analysis. In this paper, an extension to RJMCMC is proposed for change point detection with heterogeneous temporal dynamics. This approach is applied to the problem of estimating per-frame active fluorophore counts from one-dimensional integrated intensity traces derived from Fluorescence Localisation Imaging with Photobleaching (FLImP), where compound change point pair moves are introduced to better account for short-lived events known as blinking and dark states. The approach is validated using simulated and experimental data, demonstrating improved accuracy and robustness when compared with current photobleach step analysis methods and with the existing analysis approach for FLImP data. This Compound RJMCMC (CRJMCMC) algorithm performs reliably across a wide range of fluorophore counts and signal-to-noise conditions, with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) down to 0.001 and counts as high as seventeen fluorophores, while also effectively estimating low counts observed when studying EGFR oligomerisation. Beyond single molecule imaging, this work has applications for a variety of time series change point detection problems with heterogeneous state persistence. For example, electrocorticography brain-state segmentation, fault detection in industrial process monitoring and realised volatility in financial time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Normalization for CUSUM-based Change Detection in Locally Stationary Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07112v2)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A new self-normalized CUSUM test is proposed for detecting changes in the mean of a locally stationary time series. For stationary data, self-normalization relies on the factorization of a constant long-run variance and a stochastic factor. In this case, the CUSUM statistic can be divided by another statistic proportional to the long-run variance, so that the latter cancels, avoiding estimation of the long-run variance. Under local stationarity, the partial sum process converges to $\int_0^t σ(x) d B_x$ and no such factorization is possible. To overcome this obstacle, a self-normalized test statistic is introduced, based on a bivariate partial-sum process. Weak convergence of the process is proven, and it is shown that the resulting self-normalized test attains asymptotic level $α$ under the null hypothesis of no change, while being consistent against abrupt, gradual, and multiple changes under mild assumptions. Simulation studies show that the proposed test has accurate size and substantially improved finite-sample power relative to existing approaches. Two data examples illustrate practical performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Keywo...</summary><p>Keywords: Change point analysis, gradual changes, local stationarity, self-normalization, CUSUM test</p></details> |
| **[Time-Varyingness in Auction Breaks Revenue Equivalence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12306v2)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auction is applied for trade with various mechanisms. A simple but practical question is which mechanism, typically first-price or second-price auctions, is preferred from the perspective of bidders or sellers. A celebrated answer is revenue equivalence, where each bidder's equilibrium payoff is proven to be independent of auction mechanisms (and a seller's revenue, too). In reality, however, auction environments like the value distribution of items would vary over time, and such equilibrium bidding cannot always be achieved. Indeed, bidders must continue to track their equilibrium bidding by learning in first-price auctions, but they can keep their equilibrium bidding in second-price auctions. This study discusses whether and how revenue equivalence is violated in the long run by comparing the time series of non-equilibrium bidding in first-price auctions with those of equilibrium bidding in second-price auctions. We characterize the value distribution by two parameters: its basis value, which means the lowest price to bid, and its value interval, which means the width of possible values. Surprisingly, our theorems and experiments find that revenue equivalence is broken by the correlation between the basis value and the value interval, uncovering a novel phenomenon that could occur in the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures (main); 6 pages, 1 figure (appendix)</p></details> |

The objective of the paper is to analyse the impact of economic policies on wealth distribution in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Different macroeconomic and microeconomic time series are used to eliminate noise in the wealth distribution time series, and the causality analysis is performed between Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (i.e., BIPs) and the cleaned wealth distribution data to reveal possible patterns in the impacts that the endogenous policies have on wealth distribution in token economies. Lastly, a structure for economic policy taxonomy in token economies is proposed where different the policy implementations are illustrated by existing BIPs. This approach highlights the actions available to the policy makers, as well as providing a technique for analysis of policy impacts in token economies and their categorization.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 10 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

However, these efforts are hindered by a lack of highresolution data distinguishing diverse agricultural systems from forests. Here, we present the first 10m-resolution tree crop map for South America, generated using a multi-modal, spatio-temporal deep learning model trained on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery time series. The map identifies approximately 11 million hectares of tree crops, 23% of which is linked to 2000-2020 forest cover loss. Critically, our analysis reveals that existing regulatory maps supporting the EUDR often classify established agriculture, particularly smallholder agroforestry, as "forest". This discrepancy risks false deforestation alerts and unfair penalties for small-scale farmers. Our work mitigates this risk by providing a high-resolution baseline, supporting conservation policies that are effective, inclusive, and equitable.</p></details> |  |
| **[HPMixer: Hierarchical Patching for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16468v2)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In long-term multivariate time series forecasting, effectively capturing both periodic patterns and residual dynamics is essential. To address this within standard deep learning benchmark settings, we propose the Hierarchical Patching Mixer (HPMixer), which models periodicity and residuals in a decoupled yet complementary manner. The periodic component utilizes a learnable cycle module [7] enhanced with a nonlinear channel-wise MLP for greater expressiveness. The residual component is processed through a Learnable Stationary Wavelet Transform (LSWT) to extract stable, shift-invariant frequency-domain representations. Subsequently, a channel-mixing encoder models explicit inter-channel dependencies, while a two-level non-overlapping hierarchical patching mechanism captures coarse- and fine-scale residual variations. By integrating decoupled periodicity modeling with structured, multi-scale residual learning, HPMixer provides an effective framework. Extensive experiments on standard multivariate benchmarks demonstrate that HPMixer achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance compared to recent baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables, PAKDD 2026</p></details> |

The approach is inspired by recent advances in focused inference and model selection techniques. The paper generalises and extends recent work by developing a new version of the focused information criterion (FIC), directly comparing the performance of parametric time series models with a nonparametric alternative. For a pre-specified focused parameter, for which scrutiny is considered valuable, this is achieved by comparing the mean squared error of the model-based estimators of this quantity. In particular, this yields FIC formulae for covariances or correlations at specified lags, for the probability of reaching a threshold, etc. Suitable weighted average versions, the AFIC, also lead to model selection strategies for finding the best model for the purpose of estimating e.g.~a sequence of correlations.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 6 figures; Statistical Research Report (Department of Mathematics, University of Oslo), from December 2015, but arXiv'd February 2026; a later modified and extended version might then become a journal paper</p></details> |
| **[MGD: Moment Guided Diffusion for Maximum Entropy Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17211v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating samples from limited information is a fundamental problem across scientific domains. Classical maximum entropy methods provide principled uncertainty quantification from moment constraints but require sampling via MCMC or Langevin dynamics, which typically exhibit exponential slowdown in high dimensions. In contrast, generative models based on diffusion and flow matching efficiently transport noise to data but offer limited theoretical guarantees and can overfit when data is scarce. We introduce Moment Guided Diffusion (MGD), which combines elements of both approaches. Building on the stochastic interpolant framework, MGD samples maximum entropy distributions by solving a stochastic differential equation that guides moments toward prescribed values in finite time, thereby avoiding slow mixing in equilibrium-based methods. We formally obtain, in the large-volatility limit, convergence of MGD to the maximum entropy distribution and derive a tractable estimator of the resulting entropy computed directly from the dynamics. Applications to financial time series, turbulent flows, and cosmological fields using wavelet scattering moments yield estimates of negentropy for high-dimensional multiscale processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Memory Effects: Sparse Identification in Vector-Borne Diseases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20591v2)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the human burden of vector-borne diseases from limited surveillance data remains a major challenge, particularly in the presence of nonlinear transmission dynamics and delayed effects arising from vector ecology and human behavior. We develop a data-driven framework based on an extension of Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to systems with distributed memory, enabling discovery of transmission mechanisms directly from time series data. Using severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) as a case study, we show that this approach can uncover key features of tick-borne disease dynamics using only human incidence and local temperature data, without imposing predefined assumptions on human case reporting. We further demonstrate that predictive performance is substantially enhanced when the data-driven model is coupled with mechanistic representations of tick-host transmission pathways informed by empirical studies. The framework supports systematic sensitivity analysis of memory kernels and behavioral parameters, identifying those most influential for prediction accuracy. Although the approach prioritizes predictive accuracy over mechanistic transparency, it yields sparse, interpretable integral representations suitable for epidemiological forecasting. This hybrid methodology provides a scalable strategy for forecasting vector-borne disease risk and informing public health decision-making under data limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeOmni-VL: Unified Models for Time Series Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17149v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent time series modeling faces a sharp divide between numerical generation and semantic understanding, with research showing that generation models often rely on superficial pattern matching, while understanding-oriented models struggle with high-fidelity numerical output. Although unified multimodal models (UMMs) have bridged this gap in vision, their potential for time series remains untapped. We propose TimeOmni-VL, the first vision-centric framework that unifies time series understanding and generation through two key innovations: (1) Fidelity-preserving bidirectional mapping between time series and images (Bi-TSI), which advances Time Series-to-Image (TS2I) and Image-to-Time Series (I2TS) conversions to ensure near-lossless transformations. (2) Understanding-guided generation. We introduce TSUMM-Suite, a novel dataset consists of six understanding tasks rooted in time series analytics that are coupled with two generation tasks. With a calibrated Chain-of-Thought, TimeOmni-VL is the first to leverage time series understanding as an explicit control signal for high-fidelity generation. Experiments confirm that this unified approach significantly improves both semantic understanding and numerical precision, establishing a new frontier for multimodal time series modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[TIFO: Time-Invariant Frequency Operator for Stationarity-Aware Representation Learning in Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17122v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nonstationary time series forecasting suffers from the distribution shift issue due to the different distributions that produce the training and test data. Existing methods attempt to alleviate the dependence by, e.g., removing low-order moments from each individual sample. These solutions fail to capture the underlying time-evolving structure across samples and do not model the complex time structure. In this paper, we aim to address the distribution shift in the frequency space by considering all possible time structures. To this end, we propose a Time-Invariant Frequency Operator (TIFO), which learns stationarity-aware weights over the frequency spectrum across the entire dataset. The weight representation highlights stationary frequency components while suppressing non-stationary ones, thereby mitigating the distribution shift issue in time series. To justify our method, we show that the Fourier transform of time series data implicitly induces eigen-decomposition in the frequency space. TIFO is a plug-and-play approach that can be seamlessly integrated into various forecasting models. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves 18 top-1 and 6 top-2 results out of 28 forecasting settings. Notably, it yields 33.3% and 55.3% improvements in average MSE on the ETTm2 dataset. In addition, TIFO reduces computational costs by 60% -70% compared to baseline methods, demonstrating strong scalability across diverse forecasting models.</p></details> |  |

Portfolio optimization is a key component that involves allocating the portfolio assets so as to maximize returns while minimizing risk taken. It is typically carried out by financial professionals who use a combination of quantitative techniques and investment expertise to make decisions about the portfolio allocation. Recent applications of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have shown promising results when used to optimize portfolio allocation by training model-free agents on historical market data. Many of these methods compare their results against basic benchmarks or other state-of-the-art DRL agents but often fail to compare their performance against traditional methods used by financial professionals in practical settings. One of the most commonly used methods for this task is Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization (MVO), which uses historical time series information to estimate expected asset returns and covariances, which are then used to optimize for an investment objective. Our work is a thorough comparison between model-free DRL and MVO for optimal portfolio allocation. We detail the specifics of how to make DRL for portfolio optimization work in practice, also noting the adjustments needed for MVO.

Monitoring progress is challenged by gaps in survey data across countries. The United Nations Population Division addresses this with the Family Planning Estimation Model (FPEM), a Bayesian hierarchical time series model producing annual estimates of modern contraceptive use while sharing information across countries and regions. This paper evaluates how well FPEM estimates align with survey data using time series diagnostic indices from the wdiexplorer R package, which account for countries nested within sub-regions. Visualisation of survey data, modelled trajectories, and diagnostics enables assessment of model performance, highlighting where trends align and where discrepancies occur.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecasting Anomaly Precursors via Uncertainty-Aware Time-Series Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17028v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalies in time-series data is critical in domains such as industrial operations, finance, and cybersecurity, where early identification of abnormal patterns is essential for ensuring system reliability and enabling preventive maintenance. However, most existing methods are reactive: they detect anomalies only after they occur and lack the capability to provide proactive early warning signals. In this paper, we propose FATE (Forecasting Anomalies with Time-series Ensembles), a novel unsupervised framework for detecting Precursors-of-Anomaly (PoA) by quantifying predictive uncertainty from a diverse ensemble of time-series forecasting models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on reconstruction errors or require ground-truth labels, FATE anticipates future values and leverages ensemble disagreement to signal early signs of potential anomalies without access to target values at inference time. To rigorously evaluate PoA detection, we introduce Precursor Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (PTaPR), a new metric that extends the traditional Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (TaPR) by jointly assessing segment-level accuracy, within-segment coverage, and temporal promptness of early predictions. This enables a more holistic assessment of early warning capabilities that existing metrics overlook. Experiments on five real-world benchmark datasets show that FATE achieves an average improvement of 19.9 percentage points in PTaPR AUC and 20.02 percentage points in early detection F1 score, outperforming baselines while requiring no anomaly labels. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of FATE for real-time unsupervised early warning in complex time-series environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript contains 14 pages and 8 figures.

However, existing Text-to-SQL methods are not designed for continuous morphological intents such as shapes or anomalies, while time series models struggle to handle ultra-long histories. To address these challenges, we propose Sonar-TS, a neuro-symbolic framework that tackles NLQ4TSDB via a Search-Then-Verify pipeline. Analogous to active sonar, it utilizes a feature index to ping candidate windows via SQL, followed by generated Python programs to lock on and verify candidates against raw signals. To enable effective evaluation, we introduce NLQTSBench, the first large-scale benchmark designed for NLQ over TSDB-scale histories. Our experiments highlight the unique challenges within this domain and demonstrate that Sonar-TS effectively navigates complex temporal queries where traditional methods fail. This work presents the first systematic study of NLQ4TSDB, offering a general framework and evaluation standard to facilitate future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Position: Why a Dynamical Systems Perspective is Needed to Advance Time Series Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16864v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series (TS) modeling has come a long way from early statistical, mainly linear, approaches to the current trend in TS foundation models. With a lot of hype and industrial demand in this field, it is not always clear how much progress there really is. To advance TS forecasting and analysis to the next level, here we argue that the field needs a dynamical systems (DS) perspective. TS of observations from natural or engineered systems almost always originate from some underlying DS, and arguably access to its governing equations would yield theoretically optimal forecasts. This is the promise of DS reconstruction (DSR), a class of ML/AI approaches that aim to infer surrogate models of the underlying DS from data. But models based on DS principles offer other profound advantages: Beyond short-term forecasts, they enable to predict the long-term statistics of an observed system, which in many practical scenarios may be the more relevant quantities. DS theory furthermore provides domain-independent theoretical insight into mechanisms underlying TS generation, and thereby will inform us, e.g., about upper bounds on performance of any TS model, generalization into unseen regimes as in tipping points, or potential control strategies. After reviewing some of the central concepts, methods, measures, and models in DS theory and DSR, we will discuss how insights from this field can advance TS modeling in crucial ways, enabling better forecasting with much lower computational and memory footprints. We conclude with a number of specific suggestions for translating insights from DSR into TS modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[VETime: Vision Enhanced Zero-Shot Time Series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16681v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) requires identifying both immediate Point Anomalies and long-range Context Anomalies. However, existing foundation models face a fundamental trade-off: 1D temporal models provide fine-grained pointwise localization but lack a global contextual perspective, while 2D vision-based models capture global patterns but suffer from information bottlenecks due to a lack of temporal alignment and coarse-grained pointwise detection. To resolve this dilemma, we propose VETime, the first TSAD framework that unifies temporal and visual modalities through fine-grained visual-temporal alignment and dynamic fusion. VETime introduces a Reversible Image Conversion and a Patch-Level Temporal Alignment module to establish a shared visual-temporal timeline, preserving discriminative details while maintaining temporal sensitivity. Furthermore, we design an Anomaly Window Contrastive Learning mechanism and a Task-Adaptive Multi-Modal Fusion to adaptively integrate the complementary perceptual strengths of both modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VETime significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in zero-shot scenarios, achieving superior localization precision with lower computational overhead than current vision-based approaches.

| **[A Systematic Evaluation of Sample-Level Tokenization Strategies for MEG Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16626v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent success in natural language processing has motivated growing interest in large-scale foundation models for neuroimaging data. Such models often require discretization of continuous neural time series data, a process referred to as 'tokenization'. However, the impact of different tokenization strategies for neural data is currently poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of sample-level tokenization strategies for transformer-based large neuroimaging models (LNMs) applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We compare learnable and non-learnable tokenizers by examining their signal reconstruction fidelity and their impact on subsequent foundation modeling performance (token prediction, biological plausibility of generated data, preservation of subject-specific information, and performance on downstream tasks). For the learnable tokenizer, we introduce a novel approach based on an autoencoder. Experiments were conducted on three publicly available MEG datasets spanning different acquisition sites, scanners, and experimental paradigms. Our results show that both learnable and non-learnable discretization schemes achieve high reconstruction accuracy and broadly comparable performance across most evaluation criteria, suggesting that simple fixed sample-level tokenization strategies can be used in the development of neural foundation models. The code is available at https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/Cho2026_Tokenizer.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 10 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Still Competitive: Revisiting Recurrent Models for Irregular Time Series Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16161v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling irregularly sampled multivariate time series is a persistent challenge in domains like healthcare and sensor networks. While recent works have explored a variety of complex learning architectures to solve the prediction problems for irregularly sampled time series, it remains unclear what the true benefits of some of these architectures are, and whether clever modifications of simpler and more efficient RNN-based algorithms are still competitive, i.e. they are on par with or even superior to these methods. In this work, we propose and study GRUwE: Gated Recurrent Unit with Exponential basis functions, that builds upon RNN-based architectures for observations made at irregular times. GRUwE supports both regression-based and event-based predictions in continuous time. GRUwE works by maintaining a Markov state representation of the time series that updates with the arrival of irregular observations. The Markov state update relies on two reset mechanisms: (i) observation-triggered reset to account for the new observation, and (ii) time-triggered reset that relies on learnable exponential decays, to support the predictions in continuous time. Our empirical evaluations across several real-world benchmarks on next-observation and next-event prediction tasks demonstrate that GRUwE can indeed achieve competitive or superior performance compared to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Thanks to its simplicity, GRUwE offers compelling advantages: it is easy to implement, requires minimal hyper-parameter tuning efforts, and significantly reduces the computational overhead in the online deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research, 2026</p></details> |
| **[Generalised Linear Models Driven by Latent Processes: Asymptotic Theory and Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16540v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a class of generalised linear models (GLMs) driven by latent processes for modelling count, real-valued, binary, and positive continuous time series. Extending earlier latent-process regression frameworks based on Poisson or one-parameter exponential family assumptions, we allow the conditional distribution of the response to belong to a bi-parameter exponential family, with the latent process entering the conditional mean multiplicatively. This formulation substantially broadens the scope of latent-process GLMs, for instance, it naturally accommodates gamma responses for positive continuous data, enables estimation of an unknown dispersion parameter via method of moments, and avoids restrictive conditions on link functions that arise under existing formulations. We establish the asymptotic normality of the GLM estimators obtained from the GLM likelihood that ignores the latent process, and we derive the correct information matrix for valid inference. In addition, we provide a principled approach to prediction and forecasting in GLMs driven by latent processes, a topic not previously addressed in the literature. We present two real data applications on measles infections in North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany) and paleoclimatic glacial varves, which highlight the practical advantages and enhanced flexibility of the proposed modelling framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper submitted for publication</p></details> |
| **[Channel Dependence, Limited Lookback Windows, and the Simplicity of Datasets: How Biased is Time Series Forecasting?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09683v3)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF), the lookback window is a critical hyperparameter often set arbitrarily, undermining the validity of model evaluations. We argue that the lookback window must be tuned on a per-task basis to ensure fair comparisons. Our empirical results show that failing to do so can invert performance rankings, particularly when comparing univariate and multivariate methods. Experiments on standard benchmarks reposition Channel-Independent (CI) models, such as PatchTST, as state-of-the-art methods. However, we reveal this superior performance is largely an artifact of weak inter-channel correlations and simplicity of patterns within these specific datasets. Using Granger causality analysis and ODE datasets (with implicit channel correlations), we demonstrate that the true strength of multivariate Channel-Dependent (CD) models emerges on datasets with strong, inherent cross-channel dependencies, where they significantly outperform CI models. We conclude with four key recommendations for improving TSF research: (i) consider the lookback window as a key hyperparameter to tune, (ii) for standard datasets, examining CI architectures is advantageous, (iii) leverage statistical analysis of datasets to guide the choice between CI and CD architectures, and (iv) prefer CD models in scenarios with limited data.</p></details> |  |

We present an FPGA implementation of event-graph neural networks for audio processing. We utilise an artificial cochlea that converts time-series signals into sparse event data, reducing memory and computation costs. Our architecture was implemented on a SoC FPGA and evaluated on two open-source datasets. For classification task, our baseline floating-point model achieves 92.7% accuracy on SHD dataset - only 2.4% below the state of the art - while requiring over 10x and 67x fewer parameters. On SSC, our models achieve 66.9-71.0% accuracy. Compared to FPGA-based spiking neural networks, our quantised model reaches 92.3% accuracy, outperforming them by up to 19.3% while reducing resource usage and latency. For SSC, we report the first hardware-accelerated evaluation. We further demonstrate the first end-to-end FPGA implementation of event-audio keyword spotting, combining graph convolutional layers with recurrent sequence modelling. The system achieves up to 95% word-end detection accuracy, with only 10.53 microsecond latency and 1.18 W power consumption, establishing a strong benchmark for energy-efficient event-driven KWS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under revision in TRETS Journal</p></details> |

However, their intrinsic biological variability and nonlinearity pose significant challenges for controllability and predictability. To address these issues, this study investigates the application of supervised learning, a form of machine learning, to model and predict the behavior of biohybrid machines (BHMs), focusing on a muscle ring anchored on flexible polymer pillars. First, static prediction models (i.e., random forest and neural network regressors) are trained to estimate the maximum exerted force achieved from input variables such as muscle sample, electrical stimulation parameters, and baseline exerted force. Second, a dynamic modeling framework, based on Long Short-Term Memory networks, is developed to serve as a digital twin, replicating the time series of exerted forces observed in response to electrical stimulation. Both modeling approaches demonstrate high predictive accuracy. The best performance of the static models is characterized by R2 of 0.9425, whereas the dynamic model achieves R2 of 0.9956. The static models can enable optimization of muscle actuator performance for targeted applications and required force outcomes, while the dynamic model provides a foundation for developing robustly adaptive control strategies in future biohybrid robotic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Versatile Variational Quantum Kernel Framework for Non-Trivial Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10831v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum kernel methods are a promising branch of quantum machine learning, yet their effectiveness on diverse, high-dimensional, real-world data remains unverified. Current research has largely been limited to low-dimensional or synthetic datasets, preventing a thorough evaluation of their potential. To address this gap, we developed an algorithmic framework for variational quantum kernels utilizing resource-efficient ansätze for complex classification tasks and introduced a parameter scaling technique to accelerate convergence. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark of this framework on eight challenging, real-world and high-dimensional datasets covering tabular, image, time series, and graph data. Our results show that the proposed quantum kernels demonstrate competitive classification accuracy compared to standard classical kernels in classical simulation, such as the radial basis function (RBF) kernel. This work demonstrates that properly designed quantum kernels can function as versatile, high-performance tools, laying a foundation for quantum-enhanced applications in real-world machine learning. Further research is needed to fully assess the practical performance of quantum methods.</p></details> |  |

| **[StarEmbed: Benchmarking Time Series Foundation Models on Astronomical Observations of Variable Stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06200v3)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are increasingly being adopted as highly-capable general-purpose time series representation learners. Although their training corpora are vast, they exclude astronomical time series data. Observations of stars produce peta-scale time series with unique challenges including irregular sampling and heteroskedasticity. We introduce StarEmbed, the first public benchmark for rigorous and standardized evaluation of state-of-the-art TSFMs on stellar time series observations (``light curves''). We benchmark on three scientifically-motivated downstream tasks: unsupervised clustering, supervised classification, and out-of-distribution source detection. StarEmbed integrates a catalog of expert-vetted labels with multi-variate light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility, yielding ~40k hand-labeled light curves spread across seven astrophysical classes. We evaluate the zero-shot representation capabilities of three TSFMs (MOIRAI, Chronos, Chronos-Bolt) and a domain-specific transformer (Astromer) against handcrafted feature extraction, the long-standing baseline in the astrophysics literature. Our results demonstrate that these TSFMs, especially the Chronos models, which are trained on data completely unlike the astronomical observations, can outperform established astrophysics-specific baselines in some tasks and effectively generalize to entirely new data. In particular, TSFMs deliver state-of-the-art performance on our out-of-distribution source detection benchmark. With the first benchmark of TSFMs on astronomical time series data, we test the limits of their generalization and motivate a paradigm shift in time-domain astronomy from using task-specific, fully supervised pipelines toward adopting generic foundation model representations for the analysis of peta-scale datasets from forthcoming observatories.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, mitigating the adverse effects of low-predictability samples is crucial for time series analysis tasks such as time series forecasting (TSF) and time series classification (TSC). While many deep learning models have achieved promising performance, few consider how to identify and penalize low-predictability samples to improve model performance from the training perspective. To fill this gap, we propose a general Amortized Predictability-aware Training Framework (APTF) for both TSF and TSC. APTF introduces two key designs that enable the model to focus on high-predictability samples while still learning appropriately from low-predictability ones: (i) a Hierarchical Predictability-aware Loss (HPL) that dynamically identifies low-predictability samples and progressively expands their loss penalty as training evolves, and (ii) an amortization model that mitigates predictability estimation errors caused by model bias, further enhancing HPL's effectiveness.

However, redundancy and noise in time series, together with semantic gaps between non-adjacent scales, make the efficient alignment and integration of multi-scale temporal dependencies challenging. To address this, we propose SEMixer, a lightweight multiscale model designed for long-term TSF. SEMixer features two key components: a Random Attention Mechanism (RAM) and a Multiscale Progressive Mixing Chain (MPMC). RAM captures diverse time-patch interactions during training and aggregates them via dropout ensemble at inference, enhancing patch-level semantics and enabling MLP-Mixer to better model multi-scale dependencies. MPMC further stacks RAM and MLP-Mixer in a memory-efficient manner, achieving more effective temporal mixing. It addresses semantic gaps across scales and facilitates better multiscale modeling and forecasting performance. We not only validate the effectiveness of SEMixer on 10 public datasets, but also on the \textit{2025 CCF AlOps Challenge} based on 21GB real wireless network data, where SEMixer achieves third place.

In prior work, NL has been implemented and extensively tested on separable and time series data, and demonstrated its superior performance on both classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we investigate the next step in NL, viz., applying NL to linked data, in particular, data that is represented in the form of knowledge graphs. We integrate linked data into NL by implementing node aggregation on knowledge graphs, and then feeding the aggregated node features to the simplest NL architecture: ChaosNet. We demonstrate the results of our implementation on homophilic graph datasets as well as heterophilic graph datasets of verying heterophily. We show better efficacy of our approach on homophilic graphs than on heterophilic graphs. While doing so, we also present our analysis of the results, as well as suggestions for future work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep TPC: Temporal-Prior Conditioning for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16188v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-for-time series (TS) methods typically treat time shallowly, injecting positional or prompt-based cues once at the input of a largely frozen decoder, which limits temporal reasoning as this information degrades through the layers. We introduce Temporal-Prior Conditioning (TPC), which elevates time to a first-class modality that conditions the model at multiple depths. TPC attaches a small set of learnable time series tokens to the patch stream; at selected layers these tokens cross-attend to temporal embeddings derived from compact, human-readable temporal descriptors encoded by the same frozen LLM, then feed temporal context back via self-attention. This disentangles time series signal and temporal information while maintaining a low parameter budget. We show that by training only the cross-attention modules and explicitly disentangling time series signal and temporal information, TPC consistently outperforms both full fine-tuning and shallow conditioning strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance in long-term forecasting across diverse datasets.

However, existing multimodal time series datasets mostly remain at the level of surface alignment and question answering, without reaching the depth of genuine reasoning. The absence of well-defined tasks that genuinely require time series reasoning, along with the scarcity of high-quality data, has limited progress in building practical time series reasoning models (TSRMs). To this end, we introduce Time Series Reasoning Suite (TSR-Suite), which formalizes four atomic tasks that span three fundamental capabilities for reasoning with time series: (1) perception, acquired through scenario understanding and causality discovery; (2) extrapolation, realized via event-aware forecasting; and (3) decision-making, developed through deliberation over perception and extrapolation. TSR-Suite is the first comprehensive time series reasoning suite that supports not only thorough evaluation but also the data pipeline and training of TSRMs. It contains more than 23K samples, of which 2.3K are carefully curated through a human-guided hierarchical annotation process. Building on this foundation, we introduce TimeOmni-1, the first unified reasoning model designed to address diverse real-world problems demanding time series reasoning. The model is trained in multiple stages, integrating a mixture of task scenarios, novel reward functions, and tailored optimizations. Experiments show that TimeOmni-1 delivers strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks and achieves a high rate of valid responses. It significantly improves causality discovery accuracy (64.0% vs. 35.9% with GPT-4.1) and raises the valid response rate by over 6% compared to GPT-4.1 on the event-aware forecasting task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 14th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2026)</p></details> |

Predictive maintenance frameworks increasingly leverage sensor-generated time-series data, yet traditional methods require manual feature engineering, and deep learning models often degrade in online settings with evolving operational patterns. This work presents a semantic-aware, label-efficient continual learning framework for railway fault diagnostics. Accelerometer signals are encoded via a Variational AutoEncoder into latent representations capturing the normal operational structure in a fully unsupervised manner. Importantly, semantic metadata, including axle counts, wheel indexes, and strain-based deformations, is extracted via AI-driven peak detection on fiber Bragg grating sensors (resistant to electromagnetic interference) and fused with the VAE embeddings, enhancing anomaly detection under unknown operational conditions. A lightweight gradient boosting supervised classifier stabilizes anomaly scoring with minimal labels, while a replay-based continual learning strategy enables adaptation to evolving domains without catastrophic forgetting. Experiments show the model detects minor imperfections due to flats and polygonization, while adapting to evolving operational conditions, such as changes in train type, speed, load, and track profiles, captured using a single accelerometer and strain gauge in wayside monitoring.</p></details> |  |

Many algorithms for Causal Discovery (CD) have been proposed; however, they often exhibit a high sensitivity to noise, resulting in spurious causal inferences in real data. In this paper, we observe that the frequency spectra of many real-world time series follow a power-law distribution, notably due to an inherent self-organizing behavior. Leveraging this insight, we build a robust CD method based on the extraction of power-law spectral features that amplify genuine causal signals. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets with known causal structures, demonstrating its robustness and practical relevance.</p></details> |  |

While recent diffusion and flow matching models have shown promise, they often ignore informative priors such as conditional means and covariances. In this work, we propose Conditionally Whitened Generative Models (CW-Gen), a framework that incorporates prior information through conditional whitening. Theoretically, we establish sufficient conditions under which replacing the traditional terminal distribution of diffusion models, namely the standard multivariate normal, with a multivariate normal distribution parameterized by estimators of the conditional mean and covariance improves sample quality. Guided by this analysis, we design a novel Joint Mean-Covariance Estimator (JMCE) that simultaneously learns the conditional mean and sliding-window covariance. Building on JMCE, we introduce Conditionally Whitened Diffusion Models (CW-Diff) and extend them to Conditionally Whitened Flow Matching (CW-Flow). Experiments on five real-world datasets with six state-of-the-art generative models demonstrate that CW-Gen consistently enhances predictive performance, capturing non-stationary dynamics and inter-variable correlations more effectively than prior-free approaches. Empirical results further demonstrate that CW-Gen can effectively mitigate the effects of distribution shift.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the fourteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2026). https://openreview.net/forum?id=GG01lCopSK</p></details> |

| **[Can Multimodal LLMs Perform Time Series Anomaly Detection?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17812v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) has been a long-standing pillar problem in Web-scale systems and online infrastructures, such as service reliability monitoring, system fault diagnosis, and performance optimization. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in time series analysis, the potential of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), particularly vision-language models, in TSAD remains largely under-explored. One natural way for humans to detect time series anomalies is through visualization and textual description. It motivates our research question: Can multimodal LLMs perform time series anomaly detection? Existing studies often oversimplify the problem by treating point-wise anomalies as special cases of range-wise ones or by aggregating point anomalies to approximate range-wise scenarios. They limit our understanding for realistic scenarios such as multi-granular anomalies and irregular time series. To address the gap, we build a VisualTimeAnomaly benchmark to comprehensively investigate zero-shot capabilities of MLLMs for TSAD, progressively from point-, range-, to variate-wise anomalies, and extends to irregular sampling conditions. Our study reveals several key insights in multimodal MLLMs for TSAD. Built on these findings, we propose a MLLMs-based multi-agent framework TSAD-Agents to achieve automatic TSAD. Our framework comprises scanning, planning, detection, and checking agents that synergistically collaborate to reason, plan, and self-reflect to enable automatic TSAD. These agents adaptively invoke tools such as traditional methods and MLLMs and dynamically switch between text and image modalities to optimize detection performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM W...</summary><p>ACM Web Conference 2026 (WWW'26)</p></details> |

Recent advances in time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot and few-shot generalization across diverse domains, yet their effectiveness for computer networking remains unexplored. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of a TSFM, IBM's Tiny Time Mixer (TTM), on the CESNET-TimeSeries24 dataset, a 40-week real-world ISP telemetry corpus. We assess TTM under zero-shot and few-shot settings across multiple forecasting horizons (hours to days), aggregation hierarchies (institutions, subnets, IPs), and temporal resolutions (10-minute and hourly). Results show that TTM achieves consistent accuracy (RMSE 0.026-0.057) and stable $R^2$ scores across horizons and context lengths, outperforming or matching fully trained deep learning baselines such as GRU and LSTM. Inference latency remains under 0.05s per 100 points on a single MacBook Pro using CPU-only computation, confirming deployability without dedicated GPU or MPS acceleration. These findings highlight the potential of pretrained TSFMs to enable scalable, efficient, and training-free forecasting for modern network monitoring and management systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium (NOMS) 2026</p></details> |
| **[Continuous-Time Piecewise-Linear Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15649v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) we aim to recover the dynamical system (DS) underlying observed time series. Specifically, we aim to learn a generative surrogate model which approximates the underlying, data-generating DS, and recreates its long-term properties (`climate statistics'). In scientific and medical areas, in particular, these models need to be mechanistically tractable -- through their mathematical analysis we would like to obtain insight into the recovered system's workings. Piecewise-linear (PL), ReLU-based RNNs (PLRNNs) have a strong track-record in this regard, representing SOTA DSR models while allowing mathematical insight by virtue of their PL design. However, all current PLRNN variants are discrete-time maps. This is in disaccord with the assumed continuous-time nature of most physical and biological processes, and makes it hard to accommodate data arriving at irregular temporal intervals. Neural ODEs are one solution, but they do not reach the DSR performance of PLRNNs and often lack their tractability. Here we develop theory for continuous-time PLRNNs (cPLRNNs): We present a novel algorithm for training and simulating such models, bypassing numerical integration by efficiently exploiting their PL structure. We further demonstrate how important topological objects like equilibria or limit cycles can be determined semi-analytically in trained models. We compare cPLRNNs to both their discrete-time cousins as well as Neural ODEs on DSR benchmarks, including systems with discontinuities which come with hard thresholds.</p></details> |  |

To address this need, the OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) Publish-Subscribe (PubSub) model offers a promising mechanism for enabling efficient communication among heterogeneous devices. PubSub facilitates resource sharing and communication configuration between devices, but it lacks clear guidelines for mapping diverse industrial traffic types to appropriate PubSub configurations. This gap can lead to misconfigurations that degrade network performance and compromise real-time requirements. This paper proposes a set of guidelines for mapping industrial traffic types, based on their timing and quality-of-service specifications, to OPC UA PubSub configurations. The goal is to ensure predictable communication and support real-time performance in industrial networks. The proposed guidelines are evaluated through an industrial use case that demonstrates the impact of incorrect configuration on latency and throughput. The results underline the importance of traffic-aware PubSub configuration for achieving interoperability in Industry 4.0 systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology (ICIT 2026)</p></details> |

A trust model evaluates an entity or data or both to determine truthfulness. A security model confirms authentication, integrity, availability, non repudiation issues. With these aspects in mind, many models have been proposed in literature. Furthermore, many information dissemination approaches are proposed. However, the lack of a model that can manage traffic incidents completely inspires this work. This paper details how and when a message needs to be generated and relayed so that the incidents can be reported and managed in a timely manner. This paper addresses this challenge by providing a traffic incident management model to manage several traffic incidents efficiently. Additionally, we simulate this model using the VEINS simulator with vehicles, RSUs, and a TA. From the experiments, we measure the average number of transmissions required for reporting a single traffic incident while varying the vehicle density and relaying considerations. We consider two types of relaying. In one series of experiments, messages from regular vehicles and RSUs are relayed up to four hops. In another series of experiments, messages from the regular vehicles and RSUs are relayed until their generation time reaches sixty seconds. Additionally, messages from the official vehicles are relayed when they approach an incident or when the incident is cleared. Results from the simulations show that more vehicles are informed with four-hop relaying than sixty-second relaying in both cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages paper consisting of some road traffic incidents management</p></details> |

Previous methods often focus predominantly on temporal modeling or depend on predefined spatial topologies, which limits their ability to jointly model spatio-temporal dependencies and effectively capture periodic patterns in cellular traffic. To address these issues, we propose a cellular traffic prediction framework that integrates spatio-temporal modeling with time-frequency analysis. First, we construct a spatial modeling branch to capture inter-cell dependencies through an attention mechanism, minimizing the reliance on predefined topological structures. Second, we build a time-frequency modeling branch to enhance the representation of periodic patterns. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive-scale LogCosh loss function, which adjusts the error penalty based on traffic magnitude, preventing large errors from dominating the training process and helping the model maintain relatively stable prediction accuracy across different traffic intensities. Experiments on three open-sourced datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves prediction performance superior to state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>there...</summary><p>there exists some small errors in the manuscript, and we would like to check and resubmit later</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-temporal dual-stage hypergraph MARL for human-centric multimodal corridor traffic signal control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17068v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-centric traffic signal control in corridor networks must increasingly account for multimodal travelers, particularly high-occupancy public transportation, rather than focusing solely on vehicle-centric performance. This paper proposes STDSH-MARL (Spatio-Temporal Dual-Stage Hypergraph based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning), a scalable multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework that follows a centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm. The proposed method captures spatio-temporal dependencies through a novel dual-stage hypergraph attention mechanism that models interactions across both spatial and temporal hyperedges. In addition, a hybrid discrete action space is introduced to jointly determine the next signal phase configuration and its corresponding green duration, enabling more adaptive signal timing decisions. Experiments conducted on a corridor network under five traffic scenarios demonstrate that STDSH-MARL consistently improves multimodal performance and provides clear benefits for public transportation priority. Compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods, the proposed approach achieves superior overall performance. Further ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component of STDSH-MARL, with temporal hyperedges identified as the most influential factor driving the observed performance gains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Environment-Aware Network-Level Design of Generalized Pinching-Antenna Systems--Part I: Traffic-Aware Case](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17023v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing studies on generalized pinching-antenna systems are predominantly link-level, which optimize system parameters for a given user set with objectives defined by per-user performance metrics. Such designs do not capture network-level requirements, e.g., region-wide coverage and location fairness, and may require frequent re-optimization as users move or enter/leave, incurring control overhead and sensitivity to localization errors. Motivated by this gap, this two-part paper aims to develop an environment-aware network-level design framework for generalized pinching-antenna systems. Part I focuses on the traffic-aware case, where user presence is modeled statistically by a spatial traffic map and performance is optimized and evaluated in a traffic-aware sense; Part II addresses the geometry-aware case in obstacle-rich environments. In Part~I, we introduce traffic-weighted average SNR metrics and formulate two traffic-aware deployment problems: (i) maximizing the traffic-weighted network average SNR, and (ii) a fairness-oriented traffic-restricted max--min average-SNR design over traffic-dominant grids. To solve these nonconvex problems with low complexity, we reveal and exploit their separable structures. For the network-average objective, we establish unimodality properties of the hotspot-induced components and develop a candidate-based global maximization method that only needs to evaluate the objective at a small set of candidate antenna positions. For the traffic-restricted max--min objective, we develop a block coordinate decent framework where each coordinate update reduces to a globally solvable one-dimensional subproblem via an epigraph reformulation and bisection. Simulations show that traffic-aware pinching-antenna positioning consistently outperforms representative fixed and heuristic traffic-aware deployments in the considered setups.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |
| **[The Subjectivity of Respect in Police Traffic Stops: Modeling Community Perspectives in Body-Worn Camera Footage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10339v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic stops are among the most frequent police-civilian interactions, and body-worn cameras (BWCs) provide a unique record of how these encounters unfold. Respect is a central dimension of these interactions, shaping public trust and perceived legitimacy, yet its interpretation is inherently subjective and shaped by lived experience, rendering community-specific perspectives a critical consideration. Leveraging unprecedented access to Los Angeles Police Department BWC footage, we introduce the first large-scale traffic-stop dataset annotated with respect ratings and free-text rationales from multiple perspectives. By sampling annotators from police-affiliated, justice-system-impacted, and non-affiliated Los Angeles residents, we enable the systematic study of perceptual differences across diverse communities. To this end, we (i) develop a domain-specific evaluation rubric grounded in procedural justice theory, LAPD training materials, and extensive fieldwork; (ii) introduce a rubric-driven preference data construction framework for perspective-consistent alignment; and (iii) propose a perspective-aware modeling framework that predicts personalized respect ratings and generates annotator-specific rationales for both officers and civilian drivers from traffic-stop transcripts. Across all three annotator groups, our approach improves both rating prediction performance and rationale alignment. Our perspective-aware framework enables law enforcement to better understand diverse community expectations, providing a vital tool for building public trust and procedural legitimacy.</p></details> |  |

Existing studies have primarily relied on aggregated, macroscopic traffic flow data to predict future traffic trends, whereas road traffic dynamics are also influenced by individual, microscopic human driving behaviors. Recent Connected Vehicle (CV) data provide rich driving behavior features, offering new opportunities to incorporate these behavioral insights into speed prediction. To this end, we propose the Macro-Micro Cross-Attention Transformer (MMCAformer) to integrate CV data-based micro driving behavior features with macro traffic features for speed prediction. Specifically, MMCAformer employs self-attention to learn intrinsic dependencies in macro traffic flow and cross-attention to capture spatiotemporal interplays between macro traffic status and micro driving behavior. MMCAformer is optimized with a Student-t negative log-likelihood loss to provide point-wise speed prediction and estimate uncertainty. Experiments on four Florida freeways demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MMCAformer compared to baselines. Compared with only using macro features, introducing micro driving behavior features not only enhances prediction accuracy (e.g., overall RMSE, MAE, and MAPE reduced by 9.0%, 6.9%, and 10.2%, respectively) but also shrinks model prediction uncertainty (e.g., mean predictive intervals decreased by 10.1-24.0% across the four freeways). Results reveal that hard braking and acceleration frequencies emerge as the most influential features. Such improvements are more pronounced under congested, low-speed traffic conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advanced Assistance for Traffic Crash Analysis: An AI-Driven Multi-Agent Approach to Pre-Crash Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10853v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic collision reconstruction traditionally relies on human expertise and can be accurate, but pre-crash reconstruction is more challenging. This study develops a multi-agent AI framework that reconstructs pre-crash scenarios and infers vehicle behaviors from fragmented collision data. We propose a two-phase collaborative framework with reconstruction and reasoning stages. The system processes 277 rear-end lead vehicle deceleration (LVD) crashes from the Crash Investigation Sampling System (CISS, 2017 to 2022), integrating narrative reports, structured tabular variables, and scene diagrams. Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II combines these reconstructions with Event Data Recorder (EDR) signals to (1) identify striking and struck vehicles and (2) isolate the EDR records most relevant to the collision moment, enabling inference of key pre-crash behaviors. For validation, we evaluated all LVD cases and emphasized 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per crash created ambiguity due to missing or conflicting data. Ground truth was set by consensus of two independent manual annotators, with a separate language model used only to flag potential conflicts for re-checking. The framework achieved 100% accuracy across 4,155 trials; three reasoning models produced identical outputs, indicating that performance is driven by the structured prompts rather than model choice. Research analysts without reconstruction training achieved 92.31% accuracy on the same 39 complex cases. Ablation tests showed that removing structured reasoning anchors reduced case-level accuracy from 99.7% to 96.5% and increased errors across multiple output dimensions. The system remained robust under incomplete inputs. This zero-shot evaluation, without domain-specific training or fine-tuning, suggests a scalable approach for AI-assisted pre-crash analysis.</p></details> | 36 pages, 14 figures |

This gap limits research and policy analysis on the community impacts of truck traffic, especially concerning air quality and public health. To address this, we use random forest regression to estimate medium- and heavy-duty vehicle traffic volumes on network links where these data are missing. The result is a comprehensive vehicle traffic dataset that covers 85.2% of public roadways in the United States. From these data, we also calculate traffic density values for each census block and vehicle class that can serve as a high-resolution surrogate for traffic-related air pollution exposure in public health studies and policy analysis. Our high-resolution spatial data products are rigorously validated and provide a more complete representation of truck traffic than any existing publicly available dataset. These datasets are valuable for transportation planning, public health research, and policy decisions aimed at understanding and mitigating the effects of truck traffic on communities that are disproportionately exposed to air pollution from vehicle traffic.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages including references, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Individualized Federated Learning for Traffic Prediction with Error Driven Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12226v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-latency traffic prediction is vital for smart city traffic management. Federated Learning has emerged as a promising technique for Traffic Prediction (FLTP), offering several advantages such as privacy preservation, reduced communication overhead, improved prediction accuracy, and enhanced adaptability to changing traffic conditions. However, majority of the current FLTP frameworks lack a real-time model updating scheme, which hinders their ability to continuously incorporate new incoming traffic data and adapt effectively to the changing dynamics of traffic trends. Another concern with the existing FLTP frameworks is their reliance on the conventional FL model aggregation method, which involves assigning an identical model (i.e., the global model) to all traffic monitoring devices to predict their individual local traffic trends, thereby neglecting the non-IID characteristics of traffic data collected in different locations. Building upon these findings and harnessing insights from reinforcement learning, we propose NeighborFL, an individualized real-time federated learning scheme that introduces a haversine distance-based and error-driven, personalized local models grouping heuristic from the perspective of each individual traffic node. This approach allows NeighborFL to create location-aware and tailored prediction models for each client while fostering collaborative learning. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of NeighborFL, offering improved real-time prediction accuracy over three baseline models, with one experimental setting showing a 16.9% reduction in MSE value compared to a naive FL setting.</p></details> | 30 pages, 7 figures |

However, TS algorithms remain vulnerable to adversarial conditions such as interference spikes, handover storms, and localized outages. To address this, an AI-driven fuzz testing framework based on the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is proposed to systematically expose hidden vulnerabilities. Using NVIDIA Sionna, five TS algorithms are evaluated across six scenarios. Results show that AI-driven fuzzing detects 34.2% more total vulnerabilities and 5.8% more critical failures than traditional testing, achieving superior diversity and edge-case discovery. The observed variance in critical failure detection underscores the stochastic nature of rare vulnerabilities. These findings demonstrate that AI-driven fuzzing offers an effective and scalable validation approach for improving TS algorithm robustness and ensuring resilient 6G-ready networks.</p></details> |  |

Using a Transformer-based model, ROSA jointly predicts the future trajectories of vehicles and Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) at roundabouts. Trained for single-step prediction and deployed autoregressively, it generates deterministic outputs, enabling actionable speed advisories. Incorporating motion dynamics, the model achieves high accuracy (ADE: 1.29m, FDE: 2.99m at a five-second prediction horizon), surpassing prior work. Adding route intention further improves performance (ADE: 1.10m, FDE: 2.36m), demonstrating the value of connected vehicle data. Based on predicted conflicts with VRUs and circulating vehicles, ROSA provides real-time, proactive speed advisories for approaching and entering the roundabout. Despite prediction uncertainty, ROSA significantly improves vehicle efficiency and safety, with positive effects even on perceived safety from a VRU perspective.

| **[The Inevitability of Side-Channel Leakage in Encrypted Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14055v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of TLS 1.3 and QUIC has rendered payload content invisible, shifting traffic analysis toward side-channel features. However, rigorous justification for why side-channel leakage is inevitable in encrypted communications has been lacking. This paper establishes a strict foundation from information theory by constructing a formal model \(Σ=(Γ,Ω)\), where \(Γ=(A,Π,Φ,N)\) describes the causal chain of application generation, protocol encapsulation, encryption transformation, and network transmission, while \(Ω\) characterizes observation capabilities. Based on composite channel structure, data processing inequality, and Lipschitz statistics propagation, we propose and prove the Side-Channel Existence Theorem: for distinguishable semantic pairs, under conditions including mapping non-degeneracy (\(\mathbb{E}[d(z_P,z_N)\mid X]\le C\)), protocol-layer distinguishability (expectation difference \(\ge\barΔ\)), Lipschitz continuity, observation non-degeneracy (\(ρ>0\)), and propagation condition (\(C<\barΔ/2L_\varphi\)), the mutual information \(I(X;Y)\) is strictly positive with explicit lower bound. The corollary shows that in efficiency-prioritized systems, leakage is inevitable when at least one application pair is distinguishable. Three factors determine the boundary: non-degeneracy constant \(C\) constrained by efficiency, distinguishability \(\barΔ\) from application diversity, and \(ρ\) from analyst capabilities. This establishes the first rigorous information-theoretic foundation for encrypted traffic side channels, providing verifiable predictions for attack feasibility, quantifiable benchmarks for defenses, and mathematical basis for efficiency-privacy tradeoffs.</p></details> | 28 pages, 1 figure |

In real-world deployments, forecasting models must operate under structural and observational uncertainties, conditions that are rarely considered in model design. Recent approaches achieve strong short-term predictive performance by tightly coupling spatial and temporal modeling, often at the cost of increased complexity and limited modularity. In contrast, efficient time-series models capture long-range temporal dependencies without relying on explicit network structure. We propose UniST-Pred, a unified spatio-temporal forecasting framework that first decouples temporal modeling from spatial representation learning, then integrates both through adaptive representation-level fusion. To assess robustness of the proposed approach, we construct a dataset based on an agent-based, microscopic traffic simulator (MATSim) and evaluate UniST-Pred under severe network disconnection scenarios. Additionally, we benchmark UniST-Pred on standard traffic prediction datasets, demonstrating its competitive performance against existing well-established models despite a lightweight design. The results illustrate that UniST-Pred maintains strong predictive performance across both real-world and simulated datasets, while also yielding interpretable spatio-temporal representations under infrastructure disruptions. The source code and the generated dataset are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/UniST-Pred-EF27</p></details> |  |

While autonomous vehicles offer enhanced efficiency, they remain vulnerable to external attacks. In this research, we sought to investigate the potential impact of cyberattacks on traffic patterns. To achieve this, we conducted simulations where cyberattacks were simulated on connected vehicles by disseminating false information to either a single vehicle or vehicle platoons. The primary objective of this research is to assess the cybersecurity challenges confronting connected and automated vehicles and propose practical solutions to minimize the adverse effects of malicious external information. In the simulation, we have implemented an innovative car-following model for the simulation of connected self-driving vehicles. This model continually monitors data received from preceding vehicles and optimizes various actions, such as acceleration, and deceleration, with the aim of maximizing overall traffic efficiency and safety.</p></details> |  |

Amongst the highway traffic management strategies, jam-absorption driving (JAD), in which a dedicated vehicle performs "slow-in" and "fast-out" maneuvers before being captured by a stop-and-go wave, has been proposed as a potential method for preventing the propagation of such waves. However, most existing JAD strategies remain impractical mainly due to the lack of discussion regarding implementation vehicles and operational conditions. Inspired by real-world observations of police-car swerving behavior, this paper first introduces a Single-Vehicle Two-Detector Jam-Absorption Driving (SVDD-JAD) problem, and then proposes a practical JAD strategy that transforms such behavior into a maneuver capable of suppressing the propagation of an isolated stop-and-go wave. Five key parameters that significantly affect the proposed strategy, namely, JAD speed, inflow traffic speed, wave width, wave speed, and in-wave speed, are identified and systematically analyzed. Using a SUMO-based simulation as an illustrative example, we further demonstrate how these parameters can be measured in practice with two stationary roadside traffic detectors. The results show that the proposed JAD strategy successfully suppresses the propagation of a stop-and-go wave, without triggering a secondary wave. This paper is expected to take a significant step toward making JAD practical, advancing it from a theoretical concept to a feasible and implementable strategy. To promote reproducibility in the transportation domain, we have also open-sourced all the code on our GitHub repository https://github.com/gotrafficgo.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Integrated Causal Inference Framework for Traffic Safety Modeling with Semantic Street-View Visual Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13339v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Macroscopic traffic safety modeling aims to identify critical risk factors for regional crashes, thereby informing targeted policy interventions for safety improvement. However, current approaches rely heavily on static sociodemographic and infrastructure metrics, frequently overlooking the impacts from drivers' visual perception of driving environment. Although visual environment features have been found to impact driving and traffic crashes, existing evidence remains largely observational, failing to establish the robust causality for traffic policy evaluation under complex spatial environment. To fill these gaps, we applied semantic segmentation on Google Street View imageries to extract visual environmental features and proposed a Double Machine Learning framework to quantify their causal effects on regional crashes. Meanwhile, we utilized SHAP values to characterize the nonlinear influence mechanisms of confounding variables in the models and applied causal forests to estimate conditional average treatment effects. Leveraging crash records from the Miami metropolitan area, Florida, and 220,000 street view images, evidence shows that greenery proportion exerts a significant and robust negative causal effect on traffic crashes (Average Treatment Effect = -6.38, p = 0.005). This protective effect exhibits spatial heterogeneity, being most pronounced in densely populated and socially vulnerable urban cores. While greenery significantly mitigates angle and rear-end crashes, its protective benefit for vulnerable road users (VRUs) remains limited. Our findings provide causal evidence for greening as a potential safety intervention, prioritizing hazardous visual environments while highlighting the need for distinct design optimizations to protect VRUs.</p></details> | 34 pages, 13 figures |

While deep learning models have proven to be relatively more effective than traditional statistical methods for time series forecasting, their reliability is not satisfactory due to their inability to effectively handle unique characteristics of network traffic. In particular, the burst and complex traffic patterns makes the existing models less reliable, as each type of deep learning model has limited capability in capturing traffic patterns. To address this issue, we introduce TUBO, a novel machine learning framework custom designed for reliable network traffic forecasting. TUBO features two key components: burst processing for handling significant traffic fluctuations and model selection for adapting to varying traffic patterns using a pool of models. A standout feature of TUBO is its ability to provide deterministic predictions along with quantified uncertainty, which serves as a cue for identifying the most reliable forecasts. Evaluations on three real-world network demand matrix (DM) datasets (Abilene, GEANT, and CERNET) show that TUBO significantly outperforms existing methods on forecasting accuracy (by 4 times), and also achieves up to 94% accuracy in burst occurrence forecasting. Furthermore, we also consider traffic demand forecasting based proactive traffic engineering (TE) as a downstream use case. Our results show that compared to reactive approaches and proactive TE using the best existing DM forecasting methods, proactive TE powered by TUBO improves aggregated throughput by 9 times and 3 times, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Short...</summary><p>Short version of this paper is presented at ICDCS 2025</p></details> |

Specifically, we rely on measuring only the initial and final positions of a small number of cars which are generated using microscopic dynamical systems. We then implement a machine learning algorithm from scratch to reconstruct the approximate traffic density. This approach leverages learning techniques to improve the accuracy of density reconstruction despite constraints in available data. For the sake of consistency, we will prove that, if only using data from dynamical systems, the approximate density predicted by our learned-based model converges to a well-known macroscopic traffic flow model when the number of vehicles approaches infinity.</p></details> | <details><summary>64th ...</summary><p>64th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC 2025), IEEE, Dec 2025, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</p></details> |

We propose Metronome, a network-aware and priority-aware scheduling mechanism for cloud native networks. This mechanism is designed to support jobs that exhibit periodic traffic patterns and dynamic bandwidth demands, particularly in the context of distributed training. Specifically, Metronome employs a time-division multiplexing approach that leverages job traffic characteristics to construct an elastic network resource allocation model, enabling efficient bandwidth sharing across multiple jobs. In addition, it incorporates a multi-objective optimization strategy, jointly considering latency and job priorities to achieve globally optimal as well as dynamic resource allocation. Finally, Metronome adapts to the dynamic environment by monitoring the cluster and performing reconfiguration operations. Extensive experiments with 13 common machine learning models demonstrate that Metronome can enhance cluster resource utilization while guaranteeing service performance. Compared with the existing Kubernetes scheduling mechanisms across multiple scenarios, Metronome reduces job completion time by up to 19.50% while improving average bandwidth utilization by up to 23.20%.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 16 figures.

Graph-based methods are emerging as promising solutions by leveraging multi-host interactions to promote detection accuracy. But most of them face a critical problem: Graph Drift, where the flow statistics or topological information of a graph change over time. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a graph-assisted encrypted traffic detection system, MalMoE, which applies Mixture of Experts (MoE) to select the best expert model for drift-aware classification. Particularly, we design 1-hop-GNN-like expert models that handle different graph drifts by analyzing graphs with different features. Then, the redesigned gate model conducts expert selection according to the actual drift. MalMoE is trained with a stable two-stage training strategy with data augmentation, which effectively guides the gate on how to perform routing. Experiments on open-source, synthetic, and real-world datasets show that MalMoE can perform precise and real-time detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 9 figures, accepted by IEEE INFOCOM 2026</p></details> |
| **[Aligning Microscopic Vehicle and Macroscopic Traffic Statistics: Reconstructing Driving Behavior from Partial Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22242v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A driving algorithm that aligns with good human driving practices, or at the very least collaborates effectively with human drivers, is crucial for developing safe and efficient autonomous vehicles. In practice, two main approaches are commonly adopted: (i) supervised or imitation learning, which requires comprehensive naturalistic driving data capturing all states that influence a vehicle's decisions and corresponding actions, and (ii) reinforcement learning (RL), where the simulated driving environment either matches or is intentionally more challenging than real-world conditions. Both methods depend on high-quality observations of real-world driving behavior, which are often difficult and costly to obtain. State-of-the-art sensors on individual vehicles can gather microscopic data, but they lack context about the surrounding conditions. Conversely, roadside sensors can capture traffic flow and other macroscopic characteristics, but they cannot associate this information with individual vehicles on a microscopic level. Motivated by this complementarity, we propose a framework that reconstructs unobserved microscopic states from macroscopic observations, using microscopic data to anchor observed vehicle behaviors, and learns a shared policy whose behavior is microscopically consistent with the partially observed trajectories and actions and macroscopically aligned with target traffic statistics when deployed population-wide. Such constrained and regularized policies promote realistic flow patterns and safe coordination with human drivers at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[PACC: Protocol-Aware Cross-Layer Compression for Compact Network Traffic Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08331v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network traffic classification is a core primitive for network security and management, yet it is increasingly challenged by pervasive encryption and evolving protocols. A central bottleneck is representation: hand-crafted flow statistics are efficient but often too lossy, raw-bit encodings can be accurate but are costly, and recent pre-trained embeddings provide transfer but frequently flatten the protocol stack and entangle signals across layers. We observe that real traffic contains substantial redundancy both across network layers and within each layer; existing paradigms do not explicitly identify and remove this redundancy, leading to wasted capacity, shortcut learning, and degraded generalization. To address this, we propose PACC, a redundancy-aware, layer-aware representation framework. PACC treats the protocol stack as multi-view inputs and learns compact layer-wise projections that remain faithful to each layer while explicitly factorizing representations into shared (cross-layer) and private (layer-specific) components. We operationalize these goals with a joint objective that preserves layer-specific information via reconstruction, captures shared structure via contrastive mutual-information learning, and maximizes task-relevant information via supervised losses, yielding compact latents suitable for efficient inference. Across datasets covering encrypted application classification, IoT device identification, and intrusion detection, PACC consistently outperforms feature-engineered and raw-bit baselines. On encrypted subsets, it achieves up to a 12.9% accuracy improvement over nPrint. PACC matches or surpasses strong foundation-model baselines. At the same time, it improves end-to-end efficiency by up to 3.16x.</p></details> |  |

We investigate oblivious load-balancing schemes for a $N\times N$ torus network under sparse traffic where there are at most $k$ active source-destination pairs. We are motivated by the problem of load-balancing in large-scale LEO satellite networks, which can be modelled as a torus, where the traffic is known to be sparse and localized to certain hotspot areas. We formulate the problem as a linear program and show that no oblivious routing scheme can achieve a worst-case load lower than approximately $\frac{\sqrt{2k}}{4}$ when $1<k \leq N^2/2$ and $\frac{N}{4}$ when $N^2/2\leq k\leq N^2$. Moreover, we demonstrate that the celebrated Valiant Load Balancing scheme is suboptimal under sparse traffic and construct an optimal oblivious load-balancing scheme that achieves the lower bound. Further, we discover a $\sqrt{2}$ multiplicative gap between the worst-case load of a non-oblivious routing and the worst-case load of any oblivious routing. The results can also be extended to general $N\times M$ tori with unequal link capacities along the vertical and horizontal directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear in IEEE INFOCOM 2026</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce UCATSC, a model-based traffic signal control system that models traffic signal control at an intersection using a stochastic decision process with constraints and under partial observability, taking into account the uncertainty associated with vision-based perception. Unlike reinforcement learning methods that learn to predict safety using reward shaping, UCATSC predicts and enforces hard constraints related to safety and starvation prevention during counterfactual rollouts in belief space. The system is designed to improve traffic delay and emission while preventing safety-critical errors and providing interpretable control policy outputs based on explicit models.</p></details> | Total pages: 9 |
| **[Federated Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05553v2)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown promise for adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC), enabling multiple intersections to coordinate signal timings in real time. However, in large-scale settings, MARL faces constraints due to extensive data sharing and communication requirements. Federated learning (FL) mitigates these challenges by training shared models without directly exchanging raw data, yet traditional FL methods such as FedAvg struggle with highly heterogeneous intersections. Different intersections exhibit varying traffic patterns, demands, and road structures, so performing FedAvg across all agents is inefficient. To address this gap, we propose Hierarchical Federated Reinforcement Learning (HFRL) for ATSC. HFRL employs clustering-based or optimization-based techniques to dynamically group intersections and perform FedAvg independently within groups of intersections with similar characteristics, enabling more effective coordination and scalability than standard FedAvg.Our experiments on synthetic and real-world traffic networks demonstrate that HFRL consistently outperforms decentralized and standard federated RL approaches, and achieves competitive or superior performance compared to centralized RL as network scale and heterogeneity increase, particularly in real-world settings. The method also identifies suitable grouping patterns based on network structure or traffic demand, resulting in a more robust framework for distributed, heterogeneous systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Performance Evaluation of V2X Communication Using Large-Scale Traffic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07244v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicular communication (V2X) technologies are widely regarded as a cornerstone for cooperative and automated driving, yet their large-scale real-world deployment remains limited. As a result, understanding V2X performance under realistic, full-scale traffic conditions continues to be relevant. Most existing performance evaluations rely on synthetic traffic scenarios generated by simulators, which, while useful, may not fully capture the features of real-world traffic. In this paper, we present a large-scale, data-driven evaluation of V2X communication performance using real-world traffic datasets. Vehicle trajectories derived from the Highway Drone (HighD) and Intersection Drone (InD) datasets are converted into simulation-ready formats and coupled with a standardized V2X networking stack to enable message-level performance analysis for entire traffic populations comprising over hundred thousands vehicles across multiple locations. We evaluate key V2X performance indicators, including inter-generation gap, inter-packet gap, packet delivery ratio, and channel busy ratio, across both highway and urban intersection environments. Our results show that cooperative awareness services remain feasible at scale under realistic traffic conditions. In addition, the findings highlight how traffic density, mobility patterns, and communication range influence V2X performance and how synthetic traffic assumptions may overestimate channel congestion.</p></details> |  |

To fill this gap, we introduce RoadSafe365, a large-scale vision-language benchmark that supports fine-grained analysis of traffic safety from extensive and diverse real-world video data collections. Unlike prior works that focus primarily on coarse accident identification, RoadSafe365 is independently curated and systematically organized using a hierarchical taxonomy that refines and extends foundational definitions of crash, incident, and violation to bridge official traffic safety standards with data-driven traffic understanding systems. RoadSafe365 provides rich attribute annotations across diverse traffic event types, environmental contexts, and interaction scenarios, yielding 36,196 annotated clips from both dashcam and surveillance cameras. Each clip is paired with multiple-choice question-answer sets, comprising 864K candidate options, 8.4K unique answers, and 36K detailed scene descriptions collectively designed for vision-language understanding and reasoning. We establish strong baselines and observe consistent gains when fine-tuning on RoadSafe365. Cross-domain experiments on both real and synthetic datasets further validate its effectiveness. Designed for large-scale training and standardized evaluation, RoadSafe365 provides a comprehensive benchmark to advance reproducible research in real-world traffic safety analysis.</p></details> |  |

We derive analytical sensitivity expressions for the Jacobian of the individual optimal PURC flow and equilibrium link flows with respect to link cost parameters under general assumptions. This allows us to determine the marginal change in link flows following a marginal change in link costs across the network. We show how to implement these results while exploiting the sparsity generated by the PURC model. Numerical examples illustrate the use of our method for estimating equilibrium link flows after link cost shifts, identifying critical design parameters, and quantifying uncertainty in performance predictions. Finally, we demonstrate the method in a large-scale example. The findings have implications for network design, pricing strategies, and policy analysis in transportation planning and economics, providing a bridge between theoretical models and real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

We also compare against non-foundation baselines, demonstrating that the foundation-model backbones achieve improved performance. Moreover, we categorize existing models based on their architecture, input modality, and pre-training strategy. Our findings show that these models can effectively learn traffic representations and perform well with limited labeled datasets, highlighting their potential in future intelligent network analysis systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Communications Magazine</p></details> |

To function as a proactive decision-making support layer within traffic management, a digital twin must also incorporate predicted traffic conditions in addition to real-time observations. Due to the spatio-temporal complexity and the time-variant, non-linear nature of traffic dynamics, predicting motorway traffic remains a difficult problem. Sequence-based deep-learning models offer clear advantages over classical machine learning and statistical models in capturing long-range, temporal dependencies in time-series traffic data, yet limitations in forecasting accuracy and model complexity point to the need for further improvements. To improve motorway traffic forecasting, this paper introduces a Geographically-aware Transformer-based Traffic Forecasting GATTF model, which exploits the geographical relationships between distributed sensors using their mutual information (MI). The model has been evaluated using real-time data from the Geneva motorway network in Switzerland and results confirm that incorporating geographical awareness through MI enhances the accuracy of GATTF forecasting compared to a standard Transformer, without increasing model complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE IV2026 37th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium</p></details> |

However, existing methods depend on control signals at inference time to guide the generative model towards temporally consistent generation of dynamic objects, limiting their utility as scalable and generalizable data engines. In this work, we propose Localized Semantic Alignment (LSA), a simple yet effective framework for fine-tuning pre-trained video generation models. LSA enhances temporal consistency by aligning semantic features between ground-truth and generated video clips. Specifically, we compare the output of an off-the-shelf feature extraction model between the ground-truth and generated video clips localized around dynamic objects inducing a semantic feature consistency loss. We fine-tune the base model by combining this loss with the standard diffusion loss. The model fine-tuned for a single epoch with our novel loss outperforms the baselines in common video generation evaluation metrics. To further test the temporal consistency in generated videos we adapt two additional metrics from object detection task, namely mAP and mIoU. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and KITTI datasets show the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing temporal consistency in video generation without the need for external control signals during inference and any computational overheads.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE IV 2026. 8 pages, 3 figures.

| **[On Path-based Marginal Cost of Heterogeneous Traffic Flow for General Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05565v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Path marginal cost (PMC) is a crucial component in solving path-based system-optimal dynamic traffic assignment (SO-DTA), dynamic origin-destination demand estimation (DODE), and network resilience analysis. However, accurately evaluating PMC in heterogeneous traffic conditions poses significant challenges. Previous studies often focus on homogeneous traffic flow of single vehicle class and do not well address the interactive effect of heterogeneous traffic flows and the resultant computational issues. This study proposes a novel but simple method for approximately evaluating PMC in complex heterogeneous traffic condition. The method decomposes PMC into intra-class and inter-class terms and uses conversion factor derived from heterogeneous link dynamics to explicitly model the intricate relationships between vehicle classes. Additionally, the method considers the non-differentiable issue that arises when mixed traffic flow approaches system optimum conditions. The proposed method is tested on a small corridor network with synthetic demand and a large-scale network with calibrated demand from real-world data. Results demonstrated that our method exhibits superior performance in solving bi-class SO-DTA problems, yielding lower total travel cost and capturing the multi-class flow competition at the system optimum state.</p></details> |  |

Existing datasets, often limited to light haze, rain, and snow, fail to capture extreme weather conditions. To address this gap, this study introduces the Traffic Surveillance Benchmark for Occluded vehicles under various Weather conditions (TSBOW), a comprehensive dataset designed to enhance occluded vehicle detection across diverse annual weather scenarios. Comprising over 32 hours of real-world traffic data from densely populated urban areas, TSBOW includes more than 48,000 manually annotated and 3.2 million semi-labeled frames; bounding boxes spanning eight traffic participant classes from large vehicles to micromobility devices and pedestrians. We establish an object detection benchmark for TSBOW, highlighting challenges posed by occlusions and adverse weather. With its varied road types, scales, and viewpoints, TSBOW serves as a critical resource for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems. Our findings underscore the potential of CCTV-based traffic monitoring, pave the way for new research and applications.

Publishers contend these summaries substitute for source pages and cannibalize traffic, while platforms argue they are complementary by directing users through included links. We estimate the causal impact of Google's AI Overview (AIO) on Wikipedia traffic by leveraging the feature's staggered geographic rollout and Wikipedia's multilingual structure. Using a difference-in-differences design, we compare English Wikipedia articles exposed to AIO to the same underlying articles in language editions (Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, and Portuguese) that were not exposed to AIO during the observation period. Across 161,382 matched article-language pairs, AIO exposure reduces daily traffic to English articles by approximately 15%. Effects are heterogeneous: relative declines are largest for Culture articles and substantially smaller for STEM, consistent with stronger substitution when short synthesized answers satisfy informational intent. These findings provide early causal evidence that generative-answer features in search engines can materially reallocate attention away from informational publishers, with implications for content monetization, search platform design, and policy.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often fail to capture traffic's inherent chaotic nature for effective few-shot learning. We propose CAST-CKT, a novel Chaos-Aware Spatio-Temporal and Cross-City Knowledge Transfer framework. It employs an efficient chaotic analyser to quantify traffic predictability regimes, driving several key innovations: chaos-aware attention for regime-adaptive temporal modelling; adaptive topology learning for dynamic spatial dependencies; and chaotic consistency-based cross-city alignment for knowledge transfer. The framework also provides horizon-specific predictions with uncertainty quantification. Theoretical analysis shows improved generalisation bounds. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks in cross-city few-shot settings show CAST-CKT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins in MAE and RMSE, while offering interpretable regime analysis.

We present STREAM-RL, a unified framework that introduces three novel algorithmic contributions: (1) PU-GAT+, an Uncertainty-Guided Adaptive Conformal Forecaster that uses prediction uncertainty to dynamically reweight graph attention via confidence-monotonic attention, achieving distribution-free coverage guarantees; (2) CRFN-BY, a Conformal Residual Flow Network that models uncertainty-normalized residuals via normalizing flows with Benjamini-Yekutieli FDR control under arbitrary dependence; and (3) LyCon-WRL+, an Uncertainty-Guided Safe World-Model RL agent with Lyapunov stability certificates, certified Lipschitz bounds, and uncertainty-propagated imagination rollouts. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to propagate calibrated uncertainty from forecasting through anomaly detection to safe policy learning with end-to-end theoretical guarantees. Experiments on multiple real-world traffic trajectory data demonstrate that STREAM-RL achieves 91.4\% coverage efficiency, controls FDR at 4.1\% under verified dependence, and improves safety rate to 95.2\% compared to 69\% for standard PPO while achieving higher reward, with 23ms end-to-end inference latency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Confidence Driven Classification of Application Types in the Presence of Background Network Traffic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03891v5)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately classifying the application types of network traffic using deep learning models has recently gained popularity. However, we find that these classifiers do not perform well on real-world traffic data due to the presence of non-application-specific generic background traffic originating from advertisements, analytics, shared APIs, and trackers. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art application classifiers overlook such traffic in curated datasets and only classify relevant application traffic. To address this issue, when we label and train using an additional class for background traffic, it leads to additional confusion between application and background traffic, as the latter is heterogeneous and encompasses all traffic that is not relevant to the application sessions. To avoid falsely classifying background traffic as one of the relevant application types, a reliable confidence measure is warranted, such that we can refrain from classifying uncertain samples. Therefore, we design a Gaussian Mixture Model-based classification framework that improves the indication of the deep learning classifier's confidence to allow more reliable classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Addit...</summary><p>Additional clarification; pending submission</p></details> |

HetroD targets the critical challenge of navi- gating real-world heterogeneous traffic dominated by vulner- able road users (VRUs), including pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists that interact with vehicles. These mixed agent types exhibit complex behaviors such as hook turns, lane splitting, and informal right-of-way negotiation. Such behaviors pose significant challenges for autonomous vehicles but remain underrepresented in existing datasets focused on structured, lane-disciplined traffic. To bridge the gap, we collect a large- scale drone-based dataset to provide a holistic observation of traffic scenes with centimeter-accurate annotations, HD maps, and traffic signal states. We further develop a modular toolkit for extracting per-agent scenarios to support downstream task development. In total, the dataset comprises over 65.4k high- fidelity agent trajectories, 70% of which are from VRUs. HetroD supports modeling of VRU behaviors in dense, het- erogeneous traffic and provides standardized benchmarks for forecasting, planning, and simulation tasks. Evaluation results reveal that state-of-the-art prediction and planning models struggle with the challenges presented by our dataset: they fail to predict lateral VRU movements, cannot handle unstructured maneuvers, and exhibit limited performance in dense and multi-agent scenarios, highlighting the need for more robust approaches to heterogeneous traffic.

We construct two graphs: an undirected graph $\mathcal{G}^u$ capturing spatial correlations across geography, and a directed graph $\mathcal{G}^d$ capturing sequential relationships over time. We predict future samples of signal $\mathbf{x}$, assuming it is "smooth" with respect to both $\mathcal{G}^u$ and $\mathcal{G}^d$, where we design new $\ell_2$ and $\ell_1$-norm variational terms to quantify and promote signal smoothness (low-frequency reconstruction) on a directed graph. We design an iterative algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and unroll it into a feed-forward network for data-driven parameter learning. We periodically insert graph learning modules for $\mathcal{G}^u$ and $\mathcal{G}^d$ that play the role of self-attention. Experiments show that our unrolled networks achieve competitive traffic forecast performance as state-of-the-art prediction schemes, while reducing parameter counts drastically.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 7 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

We show that the resulting flow-weighted end-to-end delay minimization is a convex program, yielding a global system-optimal solution characterized by KKT conditions that equalize total marginal costs (a path marginal access term plus a node congestion price) across all utilized routes. This condition admits a Wardrop-type interpretation: for each source, all utilized options equalize total marginal cost, while any option with strictly larger total marginal cost receives no flow. Building on this structure, we develop a lightweight distributed pricing-based algorithm in which each service node locally computes and broadcasts a scalar congestion price from its observed aggregate load, while each source updates its traffic split by solving a small separable convex allocation problem under the advertised prices. Numerical illustrations demonstrate convergence of the distributed iteration to the centralized optimum and highlight the trade-offs induced by jointly modeling access and service congestion.</p></details> | <details><summary>10pag...</summary><p>10pages, 7 figures, submitted a version conference</p></details> |

However, existing studies often rely on limited datasets and fixed network configurations. In this paper, we analyze Zigbee network traffic from three complementary perspectives: data collection, traffic classification, and storage efficiency. We introduce ZIOTP2025, a publicly available dataset of Zigbee traffic collected from commercial smart home devices deployed under multiple network configurations and capturing realistic interaction scenarios. Using this dataset, we study two traffic classification tasks: device type classification and individual device identification, and evaluate their robustness under both intra-configuration and cross-configuration settings. Our results show that while high classification accuracy can be achieved under controlled conditions, performance degrades significantly when models are evaluated across different network configurations, particularly for fine-grained identification tasks. Finally, we investigate the trade-off between traffic storage requirements and classification accuracy. We show that lossy compression of traffic features through quantization can reduce storage requirements by approximately 4-5x compared to lossless storage of raw packet traces, while preserving near-lossless classification performance. Overall, our results highlight the need for topology-aware Zigbee traffic analysis and storage-efficient feature compression to enable robust and scalable IoT forensic systems.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging this, we introduce SATORIS-N, a framework for imputing partially observed traffic-density by informed subspace priors from neighboring days. Our contribution is a subspace-aware semidefinite programming (SDP)} formulation of nuclear norm that explicitly informs the reconstruction with prior singular-subspace information. This convex formulation jointly enforces low rank and subspace alignment, providing a single global optimum and substantially improving accuracy under medium and high occlusion. We also study a lightweight implicit subspace-alignment} strategy in which matrices from consecutive days are concatenated to encourage alignment of spatial or temporal singular directions. Although this heuristic offers modest gains when missing rates are low, the explicit SDP approach is markedly more robust when large fractions of entries are missing. Across two real-world datasets (Beijing and Shanghai), SATORIS-N consistently outperforms standard matrix-completion methods such as SoftImpute, IterativeSVD, statistical, and even deep learning baselines at high occlusion levels. The framework generalizes to other spatiotemporal settings in which singular subspaces evolve slowly over time. In the context of intelligent vehicles and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) systems, accurate traffic-density reconstruction enables critical applications including cooperative perception, predictive routing, and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication optimization. When infrastructure sensors or vehicle-reported observations are incomplete - due to communication dropouts, sensor occlusions, or sparse connected vehicle penetration-reliable imputation becomes essential for safe and efficient autonomous navigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-Centric Traffic Signal Control for Equity: A Multi-Agent Action Branching Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02959v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinating traffic signals along multimodal corridors is challenging because many multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches remain vehicle-centric and struggle with high-dimensional discrete action spaces. We propose MA2B-DDQN, a human-centric multi-agent action-branching double Deep Q-Network (DQN) framework that explicitly optimizes traveler-level equity. Our key contribution is an action-branching discrete control formulation that decomposes corridor control into (i) local, per-intersection actions that allocate green time between the next two phases and (ii) a single global action that selects the total duration of those phases. This decomposition enables scalable coordination under discrete control while reducing the effective complexity of joint decision-making. We also design a human-centric reward that penalizes the number of delayed individuals in the corridor, accounting for pedestrians, vehicle occupants, and transit passengers. Extensive evaluations across seven realistic traffic scenarios in Melbourne, Australia, demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the number of impacted travelers, outperforming existing DRL and baseline methods. Experiments confirm the robustness of our model, showing minimal variance across diverse settings. This framework not only advocates for a fairer traffic signal system but also provides a scalable solution adaptable to varied urban traffic conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatiotemporal Decision Transformer for Traffic Coordination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02903v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signal control is a critical challenge in urban transportation, requiring coordination among multiple intersections to optimize network-wide traffic flow. While reinforcement learning has shown promise for adaptive signal control, existing methods struggle with multi-agent coordination and sample efficiency. We introduce MADT (Multi-Agent Decision Transformer), a novel approach that reformulates multi-agent traffic signal control as a sequence modeling problem. MADT extends the Decision Transformer paradigm to multi-agent settings by incorporating: (1) a graph attention mechanism for modeling spatial dependencies between intersections, (2) a|temporal transformer encoder for capturing traffic dynamics, and (3) return-to-go conditioning for target performance specification. Our approach enables offline learning from historical traffic data, with architecture design that facilitates potential online fine-tuning. Experiments on synthetic grid networks and real-world traffic scenarios demonstrate that MADT achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing average travel time by 5-6% compared to the strongest baseline while exhibiting superior coordination among adjacent intersections.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accurate Network Traffic Matrix Prediction via LEAD: a Large Language Model-Enhanced Adapter-Based Conditional Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21437v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driven by the evolution toward 6G and AI-native edge intelligence, network operations increasingly require predictive and risk-aware adaptation under stringent computation and latency constraints. Network Traffic Matrix (TM), which characterizes flow volumes between nodes, is a fundamental signal for proactive traffic engineering. However, accurate TM forecasting remains challenging due to the stochastic, non-linear, and bursty nature of network dynamics. Existing discriminative models often suffer from over-smoothing and provide limited uncertainty awareness, leading to poor fidelity under extreme bursts. To address these limitations, we propose LEAD, a Large Language Model (LLM)-Enhanced Adapter-based conditional Diffusion model. First, LEAD adopts a "Traffic-to-Image" paradigm to transform traffic matrices into RGB images, enabling global dependency modeling via vision backbones. Then, we design a "Frozen LLM with Trainable Adapter" model, which efficiently captures temporal semantics with limited computational cost. Moreover, we propose a Dual-Conditioning Strategy to precisely guide a diffusion model to generate complex, dynamic network traffic matrices. Experiments on the Abilene and GEANT datasets demonstrate that LEAD outperforms all baselines. On the Abilene dataset, LEAD attains a remarkable 45.2% reduction in RMSE against the best baseline, with the error margin rising only marginally from 0.1098 at one-step to 0.1134 at 20-step predictions. Meanwhile, on the GEANT dataset, LEAD achieves a 0.0258 RMSE at 20-step prediction horizon which is 27.3% lower than the best baseline.</p></details> |  |

These approaches include a single-run multi-query preprocessing algorithm (Floyd-Warshall-Ingerman), continuous single-query real-time search (Dijkstra's and A*), and an algorithm combining both approaches to balance between their trade-offs by first finding the top K shortest paths then iterating over them in real time (Yen's). Dijkstra's and A* resulted in the most traffic-aware optimal solutions with minimal preprocessing required. Floyd-Warshall-Ingerman was the fastest in real time but provided distance based paths with no traffic awareness. Yen's algorithm required significant preprocessing but balanced between the other two approaches in terms of runtime speed and optimality. Each approach presents advantages and disadvantages that need to be weighed depending on the circumstances of specific deployment contexts to select the best custom solution. *This project was completed as part of ELEC 844 (Search and Planning Algorithms for Robotics) in the Fall 2025 term.</p></details> |  |

This article presents a Python implementation of ASM, featuring end-to-end calibration using real-world ground truth data. The calibration is formulated as a parameterized kernel optimization problem. The model is calibrated using data from a full-state observation testbed, with input from a sparse radar sensor network. The implementation is developed in PyTorch, enabling integration with various deep learning methods. We evaluate the results in terms of speed distribution, spatio-temporal error distribution, and spatial error to provide benchmark metrics for the traffic reconstruction problem. We further demonstrate the usability of the calibrated method across multiple freeways. Finally, we discuss the challenges of reproducibility in general traffic model calibration and the limitations of ASM. This article is reproducible and can serve as a benchmark for various freeway operation tasks.</p></details> |  |

The complex spatio-temporal dependencies and nonlinear dynamics of urban mobility networks further complicate few-shot learning across different cities. This paper proposes MCPST, a novel Multi-phase Consensus Spatio-Temporal framework for few-shot traffic forecasting that reconceptualises traffic prediction as a multi-phase consensus learning problem. Our framework introduces three core innovations: (1) a multi-phase engine that models traffic dynamics through diffusion, synchronisation, and spectral embeddings for comprehensive dynamic characterisation; (2) an adaptive consensus mechanism that dynamically fuses phase-specific predictions while enforcing consistency; and (3) a structured meta-learning strategy for rapid adaptation to new cities with minimal data. We establish extensive theoretical guarantees, including representation theorems with bounded approximation errors and generalisation bounds for few-shot adaptation. Through experiments on four real-world datasets, MCPST outperforms fourteen state-of-the-art methods in spatio-temporal graph learning methods, dynamic graph transfer learning methods, prompt-based spatio-temporal prediction methods and cross-domain few-shot settings, improving prediction accuracy while reducing required training data and providing interpretable insights.

As one of its major selling points, Matter's design imposes particular attention to security and privacy: it provides validated secure session establishment protocols, and it uses robust security algorithms to secure communications between IoT devices and Matter controllers. However, to our knowledge, there is no systematic analysis investigating the extent to which a passive attacker, in possession of lower layer keys or exploiting security misconfiguration at those layers, could infer information by passively analyzing encrypted Matter traffic. In this paper, we fill this gap by analyzing the robustness of the Matter IoT standard to encrypted traffic analysis performed by a passive eavesdropper. By using various datasets collected from real-world testbeds and simulated setups, we identify patterns in metadata of the encrypted Matter traffic that allow inferring the specific interactions occurring between end devices and controllers. Moreover, we associate patterns in sequences of interactions to specific types of IoT devices. These patterns can be used to create fingerprints that allow a passive attacker to infer the type of devices used in the network, constituting a serious breach of users privacy. Our results reveal that we can identify specific Matter interactions that occur in encrypted traffic with over $95\%$ accuracy also in the presence of packet losses and delays. Moreover, we can identify Matter device types with a minimum accuracy of $88\%$. The CSA acknowledged our findings, and expressed the willingness to address such vulnerabilities in the next releases of the standard.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 figure, 12 tables</p></details> |
| **[ForSim: Stepwise Forward Simulation for Traffic Policy Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01916v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the foundation of closed-loop training and evaluation in autonomous driving, traffic simulation still faces two fundamental challenges: covariate shift introduced by open-loop imitation learning and limited capacity to reflect the multimodal behaviors observed in real-world traffic. Although recent frameworks such as RIFT have partially addressed these issues through group-relative optimization, their forward simulation procedures remain largely non-reactive, leading to unrealistic agent interactions within the virtual domain and ultimately limiting simulation fidelity. To address these issues, we propose ForSim, a stepwise closed-loop forward simulation paradigm. At each virtual timestep, the traffic agent propagates the virtual candidate trajectory that best spatiotemporally matches the reference trajectory through physically grounded motion dynamics, thereby preserving multimodal behavioral diversity while ensuring intra-modality consistency. Other agents are updated with stepwise predictions, yielding coherent and interaction-aware evolution. When incorporated into the RIFT traffic simulation framework, ForSim operates in conjunction with group-relative optimization to fine-tune traffic policy. Extensive experiments confirm that this integration consistently improves safety while maintaining efficiency, realism, and comfort. These results underscore the importance of modeling closed-loop multimodal interactions within forward simulation and enhance the fidelity and reliability of traffic simulation for autonomous driving.

Although recent large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their single-agent architectures often struggle with heterogeneous, domain-specific crash data and tend to generate biased or unstable predictions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes TransportAgents, a hybrid multi-agent framework that integrates category-specific LLM reasoning with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) integration module. Each specialized agent focuses on a particular subset of traffic information, such as demographics, environmental context, or incident details, to produce intermediate severity assessments that are subsequently fused into a unified prediction. Extensive experiments on two complementary U.S. datasets, the Consumer Product Safety Risk Management System (CPSRMS) and the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), demonstrate that TransportAgents consistently outperforms both traditional machine learning and advanced LLM-based baselines. Across three representative backbones, including closed-source models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o, as well as open-source models such as LLaMA-3.3, the framework exhibits strong robustness, scalability, and cross-dataset generalizability. A supplementary distributional analysis further shows that TransportAgents produces more balanced and well-calibrated severity predictions than standard single-agent LLM approaches, highlighting its interpretability and reliability for safety-critical decision support applications.</p></details> |  |

While transfer learning and federated learning have been employed to address the scarcity of traffic data by transferring traffic knowledge from data-rich to data-scarce cities without traffic data exchange, existing approaches in Federated Traffic Knowledge Transfer (FTT) still face several critical challenges such as potential privacy leakage, cross-city data distribution discrepancies, and low data quality, hindering their practical application in real-world scenarios. To this end, we present FedTT, a novel privacy-aware and efficient federated learning framework for cross-city traffic knowledge transfer. Specifically, our proposed framework includes three key innovations: (i) a traffic view imputation method for missing traffic data completion to enhance data quality, (ii) a traffic domain adapter for uniform traffic data transformation to address data distribution discrepancies, and (iii) a traffic secret aggregation protocol for secure traffic data aggregation to safeguard data privacy. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed FedTT framework outperforms the 14 state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

We introduce SimGym, a scalable system for rapid offline A/B testing using traffic-grounded synthetic buyers powered by Large Language Model agents operating in a live browser. SimGym extracts per-shop buyer profiles and intents from production interaction data, identifies distinct behavioral archetypes, and simulates cohort-weighted sessions across control and treatment storefronts. We validate SimGym against real human outcomes from real UI changes on a major e-commerce platform under confounder control. Even without alignment post training, SimGym agents achieve state of the art alignment with observed outcome shifts and reduces experiment cycles from weeks to under an hour , enabling rapid experimentation without exposure to real buyers.</p></details> |  |

A road partition formula consisting of the sum of logarithmic and linear functions was proposed. The state variables are a vector composed of three channels: the number of vehicles, the average speed, and space occupancy. The set of available signal phases constitutes the action space, the selected phase is executed with a fixed green time. The reward function is formulated using the absolute values of key traffic state metrics - waiting time, speed, and fuel consumption. Each metric is normalized by a typical maximum value and assigned a weight that reflects its priority and optimization direction. The simulation results, using Sumo-TensorFlow-Python, demonstrate a cross-range transferability evaluation and show that the proposed variable cell length and multi-channel state representation method excels compared to fixed cell length in optimization performance.</p></details> |  |

While some approaches incorporate high-definition maps as supplementary information, these solutions face challenges of high subscription costs and limited real-time performance. To address these limitations, we explore an innovative information source: traffic flow, which offers real-time capabilities without additional costs. This paper proposes a TrafficFlow-aware Lane perception Module (TFM) that effectively extracts real-time traffic flow features and seamlessly integrates them with existing lane perception algorithms. This solution originated from real-world autonomous driving conditions and was subsequently validated on open-source algorithms and datasets. Extensive experiments on four mainstream models and two public datasets (Nuscenes and OpenLaneV2) using standard evaluation metrics show that TFM consistently improves performance, achieving up to +4.1% mAP gain on the Nuscenes dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

We introduce Versatile Behavior Diffusion (VBD), a novel traffic scenario generation framework based on diffusion generative models that synthesizes scene-consistent, realistic, and controllable multi-agent interactions. VBD achieves strong performance in closed-loop traffic simulation, generating scene-consistent agent behaviors that reflect complex agent interactions. A key capability of VBD is inference-time scenario editing through multi-step refinement, guided by behavior priors and model-based optimization objectives, enabling flexible and controllable behavior generation. Despite being trained on real-world traffic datasets with only normal conditions, we introduce conflict-prior and game-theoretic guidance approaches. These approaches enable the generation of interactive, customizable, or long-tail safety-critical scenarios, which are essential for comprehensive testing and validation of autonomous driving systems. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and versatility of VBD and highlight its promise as a foundational tool for advancing traffic simulation and autonomous vehicle development.

Although existing offline ML-driven approaches accelerate TE optimization with deep neural networks (DNNs), they often lack sufficient expressiveness and generalization on unseen traffic patterns or topologies, limiting their practicality. Inspired by the success of large language models (LMs), for the first time, this paper investigates their potential as general-purpose traffic planners. Our contributions are two-fold: (i) Theoretically, we show that pre-trained LMs can simulate the sequential decision processes underlying TE and, crucially, exhibit parallel reasoning capabilities, making them well-suited for the task; (ii) Practically, we present LMTE, a novel LM-driven TE framework that embraces these insights through efficient multimodal alignment and lightweight configuration generation, all while preserving the model's original abilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fold matches top-tier performance on five datasets, achieving up to 15\% better maximum link utilization (MLU) and consistently lower performance degradation across diverse scenarios, e.g., less than 5\% with high traffic dynamics and link failures. Moreover, it achieves 10 to 100 times speedups over traditional TE solvers.

Existing federated methods frequently struggle with this data heterogeneity, typically entangling globally shared patterns with client-specific local dynamics within a single representation. In this work, we postulate that this heterogeneity stems from the entanglement of two distinct generative sources: client-specific localized dynamics and cross-client global spatial-temporal patterns. Motivated by this perspective, we introduce FedDis, a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to leverage causal disentanglement for federated spatial-temporal prediction. Architecturally, FedDis comprises a dual-branch design wherein a Personalized Bank learns to capture client-specific factors, while a Global Pattern Bank distills common knowledge. This separation enables robust cross-client knowledge transfer while preserving high adaptability to unique local environments. Crucially, a mutual information minimization objective is employed to enforce informational orthogonality between the two branches, thereby ensuring effective disentanglement. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedDis consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, promising efficiency, and superior expandability.</p></details> |  |

In pre-training, Nethira introduces hierarchical reconstruction at multiple levels-byte, protocol, and packet-capturing comprehensive traffic structural information. During fine-tuning, Nethira proposes a consistency-regularized strategy with hierarchical traffic augmentation to reduce label dependence. Experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that Nethira outperforms seven existing pre-trained models, achieving an average F1-score improvement of 9.11%, and reaching comparable performance with only 1% labeled data on high-heterogeneity network tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP) 2026</p></details> |

Current machine learning and deep learning approaches for traffic classification face three critical challenges: computational inefficiency of Transformer architectures, inadequate traffic representations with loss of crucial byte-level features while retaining detrimental biases, and poor handling of long-tail distributions in real-world data. We propose NetMamba+, a framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: (1) an efficient architecture considering Mamba and Flash Attention mechanisms, (2) a multimodal traffic representation scheme that preserves essential traffic information while eliminating biases, and (3) a label distribution-aware fine-tuning strategy. Evaluation experiments on massive datasets encompassing four main classification tasks showcase NetMamba+'s superior classification performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with improvements of up to 6.44\% in F1 score. Moreover, NetMamba+ demonstrates excellent efficiency, achieving 1.7x higher inference throughput than the best baseline while maintaining comparably low memory usage. Furthermore, NetMamba+ exhibits superior few-shot learning abilities, achieving better classification performance with fewer labeled data. Additionally, we implement an online traffic classification system that demonstrates robust real-world performance with a throughput of 261.87 Mb/s. As the first framework to adapt Mamba architecture for network traffic classification, NetMamba+ opens new possibilities for efficient and accurate traffic analysis in complex network environments.</p></details> |  |

| **[Incident-Guided Spatiotemporal Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02528v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of deep-learning-based, graph-neural-network-based forecasting methods for modern intelligent transportation systems. However, most existing work focuses exclusively on capturing spatio-temporal dependencies from historical traffic data, while overlooking the fact that suddenly occurring transportation incidents, such as traffic accidents and adverse weather, serve as external disturbances that can substantially alter temporal patterns. We argue that this issue has become a major obstacle to modeling the dynamics of traffic systems and improving prediction accuracy, but the unpredictability of incidents makes it difficult to observe patterns from historical sequences. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework named the Incident-Guided Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (IGSTGNN). IGSTGNN explicitly models the incident's impact through two core components: an Incident-Context Spatial Fusion (ICSF) module to capture the initial heterogeneous spatial influence, and a Temporal Incident Impact Decay (TIID) module to model the subsequent dynamic dissipation. To facilitate research on the spatio-temporal impact of incidents on traffic flow, a large-scale dataset is constructed and released, featuring incident records that are time-aligned with traffic time series. On this new benchmark, the proposed IGSTGNN framework is demonstrated to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, the generalizability of the ICSF and TIID modules is validated by integrating them into various existing models.</p></details> |  |

Predicting such behavior at scale is a critical challenge with major implications for urban planning and sustainable transport. Traditional methods use handcrafted assumptions and costly data collection, making them impractical for early-stage evaluations of new technologies or policies. We introduce Generative Traffic Agents (GTA) for simulating large-scale, context-sensitive transportation choices using LLM-powered, persona-based agents. GTA generates artificial populations from census-based sociodemographic data. It simulates activity schedules and mode choices, enabling scalable, human-like simulations without handcrafted rules. We evaluate GTA in Berlin-scale experiments, comparing simulation results against empirical data. While agents replicate patterns, such as modal split by socioeconomic status, they show systematic biases in trip length and mode preference. GTA offers new opportunities for modeling how future innovations, from bike lanes to transit apps, shape mobility decisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version has been conditionally accepted at CHI 2026</p></details> |

However, many existing approaches rely on end-to-end supervised pipelines or task-specific fine-tuning, resulting in traffic representations that are tightly coupled to labeled datasets and deployment environments, which can limit generalizability. In this paper, we study the problem of learning generalizable traffic representations for IoT device identification. We design compact encoder architectures that learn per-flow embeddings from unlabeled IoT traffic and evaluate them using a frozen-encoder protocol with a simple supervised classifier. Our specific contributions are threefold. (1) We develop unsupervised encoder--decoder models that learn compact traffic representations from unlabeled IoT network flows and assess their quality through reconstruction-based analysis. (2) We show that these learned representations can be used effectively for IoT device-type classification using simple, lightweight classifiers trained on frozen embeddings. (3) We provide a systematic benchmarking study against the state-of-the-art pretrained traffic encoders, showing that larger models do not necessarily yield more robust representations for IoT traffic. Using more than 18 million real IoT traffic flows collected across multiple years and deployment environments, we learn traffic representations from unlabeled data and evaluate device-type classification on disjoint labeled subsets, achieving macro F1-scores exceeding 0.9 for device-type classification and demonstrating robustness under cross-environment deployment.</p></details> | 15 pages, 15 figures |

Although learning-based approaches have been proposed to address the scalability of traditional TE algorithms, their practical application is often hindered by a lack of generalization, high training overhead, and a failure to respect link capacities. This paper proposes TELGEN, a novel TE algorithm that learns to solve TE problems efficiently in large-scale network scenarios, while achieving superior generalizability across diverse network conditions. TELGEN is based on the novel idea of transforming the problem of "predicting the optimal TE solution" into "predicting the optimal TE algorithm", which enables TELGEN to learn and efficiently approximate the end-to-end solving process of classical optimal TE algorithms. The learned algorithm is agnostic to the exact underlying network topology or traffic patterns, and is able to very efficiently solve TE problems given arbitrary inputs and generalize well to unseen topologies and demands. We train and evaluate TELGEN with random and real-world topologies, with networks of up to 5000 nodes and 3.6x10^6 links in testing. TELGEN shows less than 3% optimality gap while ensuring feasibility in all testing scenarios, even when the test network has 2-20x more nodes than the largest training network. It also saves up to 84% TE solving time than traditional interior-point method, and reduces up to 79.6% training time per epoch than the state-of-the-art learning-based algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IEEE Transactions on Networking</p></details> |

These tasks often rely on low-level traffic control settings, which require manual setup and technical expertise. This paper presents an automated framework that converts high-level traffic shaping intents in natural or declarative language into valid and correct traffic control rules. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first end-to-end pipeline that ties intent translation in a queuing-theoretic semantic model and, with a rule-based critic, yields deployable Linux traffic control configuration sets. The framework has three steps: (1) a queuing simulation with priority scheduling and Active Queue Management (AQM) builds a semantic model; (2) a language model, using this semantic model and a traffic profile, generates sub-intents and configuration rules; and (3) a rule-based critic checks and adjusts the rules for correctness and policy compliance. We evaluate multiple language models by generating traffic control commands from business intents that comply with relevant standards for traffic control protocols. Experimental results on 100 intents show significant gains, with LLaMA3 reaching 0.88 semantic similarity and 0.87 semantic coverage, outperforming other models by over 30\. A thorough sensitivity study demonstrates that AQM-guided prompting reduces variability threefold compared to zero-shot baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 page, 4 figures, Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC) 2026</p></details> |

Behavior cloning suffers from covariate shift, while Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) is notoriously unstable in multi-agent settings. We identify a key source of this instability: irrelevant interaction misguidance, where a discriminator penalizes an ego vehicle's realistic behavior due to unrealistic interactions among its neighbors. To address this, we propose Decomposed Multi-agent GAIL (DecompGAIL), which explicitly decomposes realism into ego-map and ego-neighbor components, filtering out misleading neighbor: neighbor and neighbor: map interactions. We further introduce a social PPO objective that augments ego rewards with distance-weighted neighborhood rewards, encouraging overall realism across agents. Integrated into a lightweight SMART-based backbone, DecompGAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WOMD Sim Agents 2025 benchmark.</p></details> | accepted by ICLR |

Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is one of the key measures to mitigate congestion, and recent studies have increasingly applied Reinforcement Learning (RL) for its adaptive capabilities. With respect to SUMO and CityFlow, the simulator Vissim offers high-fidelity driver behavior modeling and wide industrial adoption but remains underutilized in RL research due to its complex interface and lack of standardized frameworks. To address this gap, this paper proposes VissimRL, a modular RL framework for TSC that encapsulates Vissim's COM interface through a high-level Python API, offering standardized environments for both single- and multi-agent training. Experiments show that VissimRL significantly reduces development effort while maintaining runtime efficiency, and supports consistent improvements in traffic performance during training, as well as emergent coordination in multi-agent control. Overall, VissimRL demonstrates the feasibility of applying RL in high-fidelity simulations and serves as a bridge between academic research and practical applications in intelligent traffic signal control.</p></details> |  |

When multiple VR users share a Wi-Fi network, the resulting uplink and downlink traffic can quickly saturate the channel. This paper investigates the capacity of 802.11 networks for supporting realistic VR streaming workloads across varying frame rates, bitrates, codec settings, and numbers of users. We develop an emulation framework that reproduces Air Light VR (ALVR) operation, where real HEVC video traffic is fed into an 802.11 simulation model. Our findings explore Wi-Fi's performance anomaly and demonstrate that Intra-refresh (IR) coding effectively reduces latency variability and improves QoS, supporting up to 4 concurrent VR users with Constant Bitrate (CBR) 100 Mbps before the channel is saturated.</p></details> |  |
| **[Virtual Traffic Police: Large Language Model-Augmented Traffic Signal Control for Unforeseen Incidents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15816v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptive traffic signal control (TSC) has demonstrated strong effectiveness in managing dynamic traffic flows. However, conventional methods often struggle when unforeseen traffic incidents occur (e.g., accidents and road maintenance), which typically require labor-intensive and inefficient manual interventions by traffic police officers. Large Language Models (LLMs) appear to be a promising solution thanks to their remarkable reasoning and generalization capabilities. Nevertheless, existing works often propose to replace existing TSC systems with LLM-based systems, which can be (i) unreliable due to the inherent hallucinations of LLMs and (ii) costly due to the need for system replacement. To address the issues of existing works, we propose a hierarchical framework that augments existing TSC systems with LLMs, whereby a virtual traffic police agent at the upper level dynamically fine-tunes selected parameters of signal controllers at the lower level in response to real-time traffic incidents. To enhance domain-specific reliability in response to unforeseen traffic incidents, we devise a self-refined traffic language retrieval system (TLRS), whereby retrieval-augmented generation is employed to draw knowledge from a tailored traffic language database that encompasses traffic conditions and controller operation principles. Moreover, we devise an LLM-based verifier to update the TLRS continuously over the reasoning process. Our results show that LLMs can serve as trustworthy virtual traffic police officers that can adapt conventional TSC methods to unforeseen traffic incidents with significantly improved operational efficiency and reliability.</p></details> |  |

While attack traffic can often be layered into training environments using red-teaming or replay methods, generating authentic benign background traffic remains a core challenge -- particularly in simulating the complex temporal and communication dynamics of real-world networks. This paper introduces TempoNet, a novel generative model that combines multi-task learning with multi-mark temporal point processes to jointly model inter-arrival times and all packet- and flow-header fields. TempoNet captures fine-grained timing patterns and higher-order correlations such as host-pair behavior and seasonal trends, addressing key limitations of GAN-, LLM-, and Bayesian-based methods that fail to reproduce structured temporal variation. TempoNet produces temporally consistent, high-fidelity traces, validated on real-world datasets. Furthermore, we show that intrusion detection models trained on TempoNet-generated background traffic perform comparably to those trained on real data, validating its utility for real-world security applications.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel framework that transforms a single frontal-view camera image into a concise natural language description, effectively capturing spatial layouts, semantic relationships, and driving-relevant cues. The proposed model leverages a hybrid attention mechanism to enhance spatial and semantic feature extraction and integrates these features to generate contextually rich and detailed scene descriptions. To address the limited availability of specialized datasets in this domain, a new dataset derived from the BDD100K dataset has been developed, with comprehensive guidelines provided for its construction. Furthermore, the study offers an in-depth discussion of relevant evaluation metrics, identifying the most appropriate measures for this task. Extensive quantitative evaluations using metrics such as CIDEr and SPICE, complemented by human judgment assessments, demonstrate that the proposed model achieves strong performance and effectively fulfills its intended objectives on the newly developed dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at Computer Vision and Image Understanding (submitted July 25, 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Back2Color: Domain-Adaptive Synthetic-to-Real Monocular Depth Estimation for Dynamic Traffic Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07741v7)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate monocular depth estimation is a fundamental component of vision-based perception systems in intelligent transportation applications. Despite recent progress, unsupervised monocular approaches still suffer from significant performance degradation in real-world traffic scenes due to synthetic-to-real domain gaps and the presence of dynamic, non-rigid objects such as vehicles and pedestrians. In this paper, we propose Back2Color, a robust unsupervised monocular depth estimation framework that addresses these challenges through domain adaptation and uncertainty-aware fusion. Specifically, Back2Color proposes a bidirectional depth-to-color transformation strategy that learns appearance mappings from real-world driving data and applies them to synthetic depth maps, thereby constructing training samples with realistic color appearance and paired synthetic depth. In this way, the proposed approach effectively reduces the domain gap between simulated and real traffic scenes, enabling the depth prediction network to learn more stable and generalizable priors. To further improve robustness under dynamic environments, we propose an auto-learning uncertainty temporal-spatial fusion (Auto-UTSF) module, which adaptively fuses complementary temporal and spatial cues by estimating pixel-wise uncertainty, enabling reliable depth prediction in the presence of moving objects and occlusions. Extensive experiments on challenging urban driving benchmarks, including KITTI and Cityscapes, demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing unsupervised monocular depth estimation approaches, particularly in dynamic traffic scenarios, while maintaining high computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we adopt a transfer learning setup best known from computer vision. We first pretrain an embedding model on a complex task with a large number of classes and then transfer it to seven established TC datasets. The pretraining task is recognition of SNI domains in encrypted QUIC traffic, which in itself is a challenge for network monitoring due to the growing adoption of TLS Encrypted Client Hello. Our training pipeline -- featuring a disjoint class setup, ArcFace loss function, and a modern deep learning architecture -- aims to produce universal embeddings applicable across tasks. A transfer method based on model fine-tuning surpassed SOTA performance on nine of ten downstream TC tasks, with an average improvement of 6.4%. Furthermore, a comparison with a baseline method using raw packet sequences revealed unexpected findings with potential implications for the broader TC field. We released the model architecture, trained weights, and codebase for transfer learning experiments.</p></details> |  |

During off-peak hours, large parts of the networks remain underutilized, presenting significant potential for energy savings. Existing Green Traffic Engineering approaches attempt to leverage this potential by switching off those parts of the networks that are not required for the routing of specific traffic matrices. When traffic changes, the approaches need to adapt rapidly, which is hard to achieve given the complexity of the problem. We take a fundamentally different approach: instead of considering a specific traffic matrix, we rely on a traffic-oblivious routing scheme. We discuss the NP-hard problem of activating as few connections as possible while still guaranteeing that any down-scaled traffic matrix $\varrho\cdot T$ can be routed, where $\varrho \in (0,1)$ and $T$ is any traffic matrix routable in the original network. We present a $\max(\frac{1}{\varrho\cdotλ_{\text{min}}},2)$-approximation algorithm for this problem, with $λ_{\text{min}}$ denoting the minimum number of connections between any two connected routers. Additionally, we propose two post-processing heuristics to further improve solution quality. Our evaluation shows that we can quickly generate near-optimal solutions. By design, our method avoids the need for frequent reconfigurations and offers a promising direction to achieve practical energy savings in backbone networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appears in the Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications 2026 (INFOCOM 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Traffic Collisions: Temporal Patterns and Severity-Weighted Hotspot Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12548v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding traffic collision patterns is of high importance for effective road safety planning in fast-growing urban environments. This study examines the temporal and spatial patterns of traffic collisions in Dubai, UAE, with a particular focus on collision severity. To this end, traffic collision records from November 2024 to June 2025 were analyzed to examine hourly, daily, and monthly variations in collision frequency and severity for both overall traffic collisions and pedestrian-related accidents. Temporal associations with severity were evaluated using chi-square tests and Cramer's V, while spatial patterns were analyzed using severity-weighted hotspot analysis based on the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic, complemented by inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation. The results show a clear temporal variation in overall collision frequency and severity, with higher collision frequencies during evening and nighttime periods with 44% higher probability of high-severity outcomes at night compared to the afternoon. On the other hand, pedestrian-related accidents showed a distinct temporal profile, characterized by higher occurrence during late-evening hours and relatively limited variation across days of the week and months. Spatial analysis identified statistically significant severity hotspots for overall collisions in the northern and northwestern parts of Dubai and along the Al Ain-Dubai Highway, while pedestrian severity hotspots were concentrated near industrial areas in the southwestern region. Several policy measures are proposed based on the findings including, reducing nighttime speed limits, enhancing automated enforcement, improving roadway lighting, and implementing pedestrian-focused treatments in statistically significant hotspots.</p></details> |  |

Among operational loads, traffic load plays a pivotal role, and recent advances in deep learning - particularly in computer vision (CV) - have enabled progress toward continuous, automated monitoring. However, CV-based approaches suffer from limitations, including privacy concerns and sensitivity to lighting conditions, while traditional non-vision-based methods often lack flexibility in deployment and validation. To bridge this gap, we propose a fully automated deep-learning pipeline for continuous traffic monitoring using structural health monitoring (SHM) sensor networks. Our approach integrates CV-assisted high-resolution dataset generation with supervised training and inference, leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture the spatial structure and interdependence of sensor data. By transferring knowledge from CV outputs to SHM sensors, the proposed framework enables sensor networks to achieve comparable accuracy of vision-based systems, with minimal human intervention. Applied to accelerometer and strain gauge data in a real-world case study, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with classification accuracies of 99% for light vehicles and 94% for heavy vehicles.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods struggle to address the challenges of poor image quality and insufficient information under low-light conditions, leading to a decline in detection accuracy and affecting driving safety. To address this issue, we propose YOLO-LLTS, an end-to-end real-time traffic sign detection algorithm specifically designed for low-light environments. YOLO-LLTS introduces three main contributions: the HRFM-SOD module retains more information about distant or tiny traffic signs compared to traditional methods; the MFIA module interacts features with different receptive fields to improve information utilization; the PGFE module enhances detection accuracy by improving brightness, edges, contrast, and supplementing detail information. Additionally, we construct a new dataset, the Chinese Nighttime Traffic Sign Sample Set (CNTSSS), covering diverse nighttime scenarios. Experiments show that YOLO-LLTS achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous best methods by 2.7% mAP50 and 1.6% mAP50:95 on TT100K-night, 1.3% mAP50 and 1.9% mAP50:95 on CNTSSS, 7.5% mAP50 and 9.8% mAP50:95 on GTSDB-night, and superior results on CCTSDB2021.

However, during the initial stage of CAV deployment, the sparse distribution of CAVs among human-driven vehicles reduces the likelihood of forming effective cooperative platoons. To address this challenge, this study proposes a hybrid multi-agent lane change decision model aimed at increasing CAV participation in cooperative platooning and maximizing its associated benefits. The proposed model employs the QMIX framework, integrating traffic data processed through a convolutional neural network (CNN-QMIX). This architecture addresses a critical issue in dynamic traffic scenarios by enabling CAVs to make optimal decisions irrespective of the varying number of CAVs present in mixed traffic. Additionally, a trajectory planner and a model predictive controller are designed to ensure smooth and safe lane-change execution. The proposed model is trained and evaluated within a microsimulation environment under varying CAV market penetration rates. The results demonstrate that the proposed model efficiently manages fluctuating traffic agent numbers, significantly outperforming the baseline rule-based models. Notably, it enhances cooperative platooning rates up to 26.2\%, showcasing its potential to optimize CAV cooperation and traffic dynamics during the early stage of deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> |

Although CNN has shown strong capability to extract semantics from raw pixels, its capacity to capture spatial relationships of pixels across rows and columns of an image is not fully explored. These relationships are important to learn semantic objects with strong shape priors but weak appearance coherences, such as traffic lanes, which are often occluded or not even painted on the road surface as shown in Fig. 1 (a). In this paper, we propose Spatial CNN (SCNN), which generalizes traditional deep layer-by-layer convolutions to slice-byslice convolutions within feature maps, thus enabling message passings between pixels across rows and columns in a layer. Such SCNN is particular suitable for long continuous shape structure or large objects, with strong spatial relationship but less appearance clues, such as traffic lanes, poles, and wall. We apply SCNN on a newly released very challenging traffic lane detection dataset and Cityscapse dataset. The results show that SCNN could learn the spatial relationship for structure output and significantly improves the performance. We show that SCNN outperforms the recurrent neural network (RNN) based ReNet and MRF+CNN (MRFNet) in the lane detection dataset by 8.7% and 4.6% respectively. Moreover, our SCNN won the 1st place on the TuSimple Benchmark Lane Detection Challenge, with an accuracy of 96.53%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2018</p></details> |

The great majority of the existing literature proposes approaches to make centralized decisions to minimize delay propagation. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm to the same aim: we design and implement a modular process to allow trains to self-organize. This process consists in having trains identifying their neighbors, formulating traffic management hypotheses, checking their compatibility and selecting the best ones through a consensus mechanism. Finally, these hypotheses are merged into a directly applicable traffic plan. In a thorough experimental analysis on a portion of the Italian network, we compare the results of self-organization with those of a state-of-the-art centralized approach. In particular, we make this comparison mimicking a realistic deployment thanks to a closed-loop framework including a microscopic railway simulator. The results indicate that self-organization achieves better results than the centralized algorithm, specifically thanks to the definition and exploitation of the instance decomposition allowed by the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate the following complementary formulations of inverse game-theoretic learning: (i) a Closed-form Correlated Equilibrium Maximum-Likelihood estimator (CE-ML) specialized for $2\times2$ games; and (ii) a Logit Best Response Maximum-Likelihood estimator (LBR-ML) that captures long-run adaptation dynamics via stochastic response processes. Together, these approaches span the spectrum between static equilibrium consistency and dynamic behavioral realism. We evaluate them on synthetic "chicken-dare" games and traffic-interaction scenarios simulated in SUMO, comparing parameter recovery and distributional fit. Results reveal clear trade-offs between interpretability, computational tractability, and behavioral expressiveness across models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Meta Dynamic Graph for Traffic Flow Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10328v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic flow prediction is a typical spatio-temporal prediction problem and has a wide range of applications. The core challenge lies in modeling the underlying complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Various methods have been proposed, and recent studies show that the modeling of dynamics is useful to meet the core challenge. While handling spatial dependencies and temporal dependencies using separate base model structures may hinder the modeling of spatio-temporal correlations, the modeling of dynamics can bridge this gap. Incorporating spatio-temporal heterogeneity also advances the main goal, since it can extend the parameter space and allow more flexibility. Despite these advances, two limitations persist: 1) the modeling of dynamics is often limited to the dynamics of spatial topology (e.g., adjacency matrix changes), which, however, can be extended to a broader scope; 2) the modeling of heterogeneity is often separated for spatial and temporal dimensions, but this gap can also be bridged by the modeling of dynamics. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for traffic prediction, called Meta Dynamic Graph (MetaDG). MetaDG leverages dynamic graph structures of node representations to explicitly model spatio-temporal dynamics. This generates both dynamic adjacency matrices and meta-parameters, extending dynamic modeling beyond topology while unifying the capture of spatio-temporal heterogeneity into a single dimension. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of MetaDG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Recent advances in data availability and computational power enable new forms of model-driven, simulation-based decision support for transportation policy design. This paper proposes a novel simulation paradigm for the ex-ante evaluation of both direct impacts (e.g., traffic conditions, modal shift, emissions) and indirect impacts spanning transportation-related effects and economic accessibility. The approach integrates a multi-layer urban mobility model combining a physical layer of mobility flows and emissions with a social layer capturing behavioral responses and adaptation to policy changes. Real-world data are used to instantiate the current as-is scenario, while policy alternatives and behavioral assumptions are encoded as model parameters to generate multiple what-if scenarios. The framework supports systematic comparison across scenarios by analyzing variations in simulated outcomes induced by policy interventions. The proposed approach is illustrated through a case study that aims to assess the impacts of the introduction of broad urban traffic restriction schemes. Results demonstrate the framework's ability to explore alternative regulatory designs and user responses, supporting informed and anticipatory evaluation of urban traffic policies.</p></details> |  |

Existing solutions heavily rely on model-specific interpretation techniques, which lack adaptability and generality across different model architectures and deployment scenarios. In this paper, we propose BiasSeeker, the first semi-automated framework that is both model-agnostic and data-driven for detecting dataset-specific shortcut features in encrypted traffic. By performing statistical correlation analysis directly on raw binary traffic, BiasSeeker identifies spurious or environment-entangled features that may compromise generalization, independent of any classifier. To address the diverse nature of shortcut features, we introduce a systematic categorization and apply category-specific validation strategies that reduce bias while preserving meaningful information. We evaluate BiasSeeker on 19 public datasets across three NTC tasks. By emphasizing context-aware feature selection and dataset-specific diagnosis, BiasSeeker offers a novel perspective for understanding and addressing shortcut learning in encrypted network traffic classification, raising awareness that feature selection should be an intentional and scenario-sensitive step prior to model training.</p></details> |  |

A Benchmark for Long-Range Graph Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17762v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively capturing long-range interactions remains a fundamental yet unresolved challenge in graph neural network (GNN) research, critical for applications across diverse fields of science. To systematically address this, we introduce ECHO (Evaluating Communication over long HOps), a novel benchmark specifically designed to rigorously assess the capabilities of GNNs in handling very long-range graph propagation. ECHO includes three synthetic graph tasks, namely single-source shortest paths, node eccentricity, and graph diameter, each constructed over diverse and structurally challenging topologies intentionally designed to introduce significant information bottlenecks. ECHO also includes two real-world datasets, ECHO-Charge and ECHO-Energy, which define chemically grounded benchmarks for predicting atomic partial charges and molecular total energies, respectively, with reference computations obtained at the density functional theory (DFT) level. Both tasks inherently depend on capturing complex long-range molecular interactions. Our extensive benchmarking of popular GNN architectures reveals clear performance gaps, emphasizing the difficulty of true long-range propagation and highlighting design choices capable of overcoming inherent limitations. ECHO thereby sets a new standard for evaluating long-range information propagation, also providing a compelling example for its need in AI for science.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026 ( https://openreview.net/forum?id=DgkWFPZMPp )</p></details> |
| **[A Secure and Private Distributed Bayesian Federated Learning Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20003v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed Federated Learning (DFL) enables decentralized model training across large-scale systems without a central parameter server. However, DFL faces three critical challenges: privacy leakage from honest-but-curious neighbors, slow convergence due to the lack of central coordination, and vulnerability to Byzantine adversaries aiming to degrade model accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel DFL framework that integrates Byzantine robustness, privacy preservation, and convergence acceleration. Within this framework, each device trains a local model using a Bayesian approach and independently selects an optimal subset of neighbors for posterior exchange. We formulate this neighbor selection as an optimization problem to minimize the global loss function under security and privacy constraints. Solving this problem is challenging because devices only possess partial network information, and the complex coupling between topology, security, and convergence remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we first analytically characterize the trade-offs between dynamic connectivity, Byzantine detection, privacy levels, and convergence speed. Leveraging these insights, we develop a fully distributed Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm. This approach enables devices to make autonomous connection decisions based on local observations. Simulation results demonstrate that our method achieves superior robustness and efficiency with significantly lower overhead compared to traditional security and privacy schemes.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

We introduce SME-HGT, a Heterogeneous Graph Transformer framework that predicts which SBIR Phase I awardees will advance to Phase II funding using exclusively public data. We construct a heterogeneous graph with 32,268 company nodes, 124 research topic nodes, and 13 government agency nodes connected by approximately 99,000 edges across three semantic relation types. SME-HGT achieves an AUPRC of 0.621 0.003 on a temporally-split test set, outperforming an MLP baseline (0.590 0.002) and R-GCN (0.608 0.013) across five random seeds. At a screening depth of 100 companies, SME-HGT attains 89.6% precision with a 2.14 lift over random selection. Our temporal evaluation protocol prevents information leakage, and our reliance on public data ensures reproducibility. These results demonstrate that relational structure among firms, research topics, and funding agencies provides meaningful signal for SME potential assessment, with implications for policymakers and early-stage investors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal-Aware Heterogeneous Graph Reasoning with Multi-View Fusion for Temporal Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19569v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Question Answering over Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGQA) has attracted growing interest for handling time-sensitive queries. However, existing methods still struggle with: 1) weak incorporation of temporal constraints in question representation, causing biased reasoning; 2) limited ability to perform explicit multi-hop reasoning; and 3) suboptimal fusion of language and graph representations. We propose a novel framework with temporal-aware question encoding, multi-hop graph reasoning, and multi-view heterogeneous information fusion. Specifically, our approach introduces: 1) a constraint-aware question representation that combines semantic cues from language models with temporal entity dynamics; 2) a temporal-aware graph neural network for explicit multi-hop reasoning via time-aware message passing; and 3) a multi-view attention mechanism for more effective fusion of question context and temporal graph knowledge. Experiments on multiple TKGQA benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over multiple baselines.</p></details> | 6pages |
| **[Training-Free Cross-Architecture Merging for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19332v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model merging has emerged as a powerful paradigm for combining the capabilities of distinct expert models without the high computational cost of retraining, yet current methods are fundamentally constrained to homogeneous architectures. For GNNs, however, message passing is topology-dependent and sensitive to misalignment, making direct parameter-space merging unreliable. To bridge this gap, we introduce H-GRAMA (Heterogeneous Graph Routing and Message Alignment), a training-free framework that lifts merging from parameter space to operator space. We formalize Universal Message Passing Mixture (UMPM), a shared operator family that expresses heterogeneous GNN layers in a common functional language. H-GRAMA enables cross-architecture GNN merging (e.g., GCN to GAT) without retraining, retaining high specialist accuracy in most cases in compatible depth settings and achieving inference speedups of 1.2x to 1.9x over ensembles.</p></details> |  |
| **[CTS-Bench: Benchmarking Graph Coarsening Trade-offs for GNNs in Clock Tree Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19330v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly explored for physical design analysis in Electronic Design Automation, particularly for modeling Clock Tree Synthesis behavior such as clock skew and buffering complexity. However, practical deployment remains limited due to the prohibitive memory and runtime cost of operating on raw gate-level netlists. Graph coarsening is commonly used to improve scalability, yet its impact on CTS-critical learning objectives is not well characterized. This paper introduces CTS-Bench, a benchmark suite for systematically evaluating the trade-offs between graph coarsening, prediction accuracy, and computational efficiency in GNN-based CTS analysis. CTS-Bench consists of 4,860 converged physical design solutions spanning five architectures and provides paired raw gate-level and clustered graph representations derived from post-placement designs. Using clock skew prediction as a representative CTS task, we demonstrate a clear accuracy-efficiency trade-off. While graph coarsening reduces GPU memory usage by up to 17.2x and accelerates training by up to 3x, it also removes structural information essential for modeling clock distribution, frequently resulting in negative $R^2$ scores under zero-shot evaluation. Our findings indicate that generic graph clustering techniques can fundamentally compromise CTS learning objectives, even when global physical metrics remain unchanged. CTS-Bench enables principled evaluation of CTS-aware graph coarsening strategies, supports benchmarking of GNN architectures and accelerators under realistic physical design constraints, and provides a foundation for developing learning-assisted CTS analysis and optimization techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ML Bench'26 ASPLOS</p></details> |
| **[Graph Neural Network Assisted Genetic Algorithm for Structural Dynamic Response and Parameter Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22839v3)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The optimization of structural parameters, such as mass(m), stiffness(k), and damping coefficient(c), is critical for designing efficient, resilient, and stable structures. Conventional numerical approaches, including Finite Element Method (FEM) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, provide high-fidelity results but are computationally expensive for iterative optimization tasks, as each evaluation requires solving the governing equations for every parameter combination. This study proposes a hybrid data-driven framework that integrates a Graph Neural Network (GNN) surrogate model with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimizer to overcome these challenges. The GNN is trained to accurately learn the nonlinear mapping between structural parameters and dynamic displacement responses, enabling rapid predictions without repeatedly solving the system equations. A dataset of single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system responses is generated using the Newmark Beta method across diverse mass, stiffness, and damping configurations. The GA then searches for globally optimal parameter sets by minimizing predicted displacements and enhancing dynamic stability. Results demonstrate that the GNN and GA framework achieves strong convergence, robust generalization, and significantly reduced computational cost compared to conventional simulations. This approach highlights the effectiveness of combining machine learning surrogates with evolutionary optimization for automated and intelligent structural design.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Towards A Universal Graph Structural Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10917v2)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large-scale pre-training have shown the potential to learn generalizable representations for downstream tasks. In the graph domain, however, capturing and transferring structural information across different graph domains remains challenging, primarily due to the inherent differences in graph topological patterns across various contexts. For example, a social network's structure is fundamentally different from that of a product co-purchase graph. Additionally, most existing models struggle to capture the rich topological complexity of graph structures, leading to inadequate exploration of the graph embedding space. To address these challenges, we propose GFSE, a universal pre-trained graph encoder designed to capture transferable structural patterns across diverse domains such as the web graph, social networks, and citation networks. GFSE is the first cross-domain graph structural encoder pre-trained with multiple self-supervised learning objectives. Built on a Graph Transformer, GFSE incorporates attention mechanisms informed by graph structural information, enabling it to encode intricate multi-level and fine-grained topological features within complex graph structures. The pre-trained GFSE produces generic and theoretically expressive positional and structural encoding for graphs, which can be seamlessly integrated with various downstream graph feature encoders, including graph neural networks for vectorized features and Large Language Models (LLMs) for text-attributed graphs. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate GFSE's capability to significantly enhance the model's performance while requiring substantially less task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Node Affinity Prediction in Temporal Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06940v3)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node affinity prediction is a common task that is widely used in temporal graph learning with applications in social and financial networks, recommender systems, and more. Recent works have addressed this task by adapting state-of-the-art dynamic link property prediction models to node affinity prediction. However, simple heuristics, such as Persistent Forecast or Moving Average, outperform these models. In this work, we analyze the challenges in training current Temporal Graph Neural Networks for node affinity prediction and suggest appropriate solutions. Combining the solutions, we develop NAViS - Node Affinity prediction model using Virtual State, by exploiting the equivalence between heuristics and state space models. While promising, training NAViS is non-trivial. Therefore, we further introduce a novel loss function for node affinity prediction. We evaluate NAViS on TGB and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art, including heuristics.

| **[Covariance Density Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11139v2)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks have re-defined how we model and predict on network data but there lacks a consensus on choosing the correct underlying graph structure on which to model signals. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNN) address this issue by using the sample covariance matrix as a Graph Shift Operator (GSO). Here, we improve on the performance of VNNs by constructing a Density Matrix where we consider the sample Covariance matrix as a quasi-Hamiltonian of the system in the space of random variables. Crucially, using this density matrix as the GSO allows components of the data to be extracted at different scales, allowing enhanced discriminability and performance. We show that this approach allows explicit control of the stability-discriminability trade-off of the network, provides enhanced robustness to noise compared to VNNs, and outperforms them in useful real-life applications where the underlying covariance matrix is informative. In particular, we show that our model can achieve strong performance in subject-independent Brain Computer Interface EEG motor imagery classification, outperforming EEGnet while being faster. This shows how covariance density neural networks provide a basis for the notoriously difficult task of transferability of BCIs when evaluated on unseen individuals.</p></details> |  |
| **[GEDAN: Learning the Edit Costs for Graph Edit Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03111v3)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Edit Distance (GED) is defined as the minimum cost transformation of one graph into another and is a widely adopted metric for measuring the dissimilarity between graphs. The major problem of GED is that its computation is NP-hard, which has in turn led to the development of various approximation methods, including approaches based on neural networks (NN). However, most NN methods assume a unit cost for edit operations -- a restrictive and often unrealistic simplification, since topological and functional distances rarely coincide in real-world data. In this paper, we propose a fully end-to-end Graph Neural Network framework for learning the edit costs for GED, at a fine-grained level, aligning topological and task-specific similarity. Our method combines an unsupervised self-organizing mechanism for GED approximation with a Generalized Additive Model that flexibly learns contextualized edit costs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach overcomes the limitations of non-end-to-end methods, yielding directly interpretable graph matchings, uncovering meaningful structures in complex graphs, and showing strong applicability to domains such as molecular analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Graph Neural Networks for Graph-level Tasks: Taxonomy, Empirical Study, and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00773v2)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are fundamental data structures for modeling complex interactions in domains such as social networks, molecular structures, and biological systems. Graph-level tasks, which involve predicting properties or labels for entire graphs, are crucial for applications like molecular property prediction and subgraph counting. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown significant promise for these tasks, their evaluations are often limited by narrow datasets, task coverage, and inconsistent experimental setups, hindering their generalizability. In this paper, we present a comprehensive experimental study of GNNs on graph-level tasks, systematically categorizing them into five types: node-based, hierarchical pooling-based, subgraph-based, graph learning-based, and self-supervised learning-based GNNs. To address these challenges, we propose a unified evaluation framework OpenGLT for graph-level GNNs. OpenGLT standardizes the evaluation process across diverse datasets, multiple graph tasks (e.g., classification and regression), and real-world scenarios, including noisy, imbalanced, and few-shot graphs. Extensive experiments are conducted on 16 baseline models across five categories, evaluated on 13 graph classification and 13 graph regression datasets. These experiments provide comprehensive insights into the strengths and weaknesses of existing GNN architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[E2E-GRec: An End-to-End Joint Training Framework for Graph Neural Networks and Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20564v2)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling graph-structured data and have been widely used in recommender systems, such as for capturing complex user-item and item-item relations. However, most industrial deployments adopt a two-stage pipeline: GNNs are first pre-trained offline to generate node embeddings, which are then used as static features for downstream recommender systems. This decoupled paradigm leads to two key limitations: (1) high computational overhead, since large-scale GNN inference must be repeatedly executed to refresh embeddings; and (2) lack of joint optimization, as the gradient from the recommender system cannot directly influence the GNN learning process, causing the GNN to be suboptimally informative for the recommendation task. In this paper, we propose E2E-GRec, a novel end-to-end training framework that unifies GNN training with the recommender system. Our framework is characterized by three key components: (i) efficient subgraph sampling from a large-scale cross-domain heterogeneous graph to ensure training scalability and efficiency; (ii) a Graph Feature Auto-Encoder (GFAE) serving as an auxiliary self-supervised task to guide the GNN to learn structurally meaningful embeddings; and (iii) a two-level feature fusion mechanism combined with Gradnorm-based dynamic loss balancing, which stabilizes graph-aware multi-task end-to-end training. Extensive offline evaluations, online A/B tests (e.g., a +0.133% relative improvement in stay duration, a 0.3171% reduction in the average number of videos a user skips) on large-scale production data, together with theoretical analysis, demonstrate that E2E-GRec consistently surpasses traditional approaches, yielding significant gains across multiple recommendation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks Powered by Encoder Embedding for Improved Node Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11732v2)** | 2026-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for a wide range of node-level graph learning tasks. However, their performance typically depends on random or minimally informed initial feature representations, where poor initialization can lead to slower convergence and increased training instability. In this paper, we address this limitation by leveraging a statistically grounded one-hot graph encoder embedding (GEE) as a high-quality, structure-aware initialization for node features. Integrating GEE into standard GNNs yields the GEE-powered GNN (GG) framework. Across extensive simulations and real-world benchmarks, GG provides consistent and substantial performance gains in both unsupervised and supervised settings. For node classification, we further introduce GG-C, which concatenates the outputs of GG and GEE and outperforms competing methods, achieving roughly 10-50% accuracy improvements across most datasets. These results demonstrate the importance of principled, structure-aware initialization for improving the efficiency, stability, and overall performance of graph neural network architecture, enabling models to better exploit graph topology from the outset.</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Network(GNN), is proven to be an effective KG embedding technique that enables various downstream tasks like link prediction, node classification, and graph classification. The focus of research in both KG embedding and GNNs has been mostly oriented towards simple graphs with binary relations. However, real-world knowledge bases have a significant share of complex and n-ary facts that cannot be represented by binary edges. More specifically, real-world knowledge bases are often a mix of two types of n-ary facts - (i) that require hyperedges and (ii) that require hyper-relational edges. Though there are research efforts catering to these n-ary fact types, they are pursued independently for each type. We propose $H$yper$E$dge $H$yper-$R$elational edge $GNN$(HEHRGNN), a unified embedding model for n-ary relational KGs with both hyperedges and hyper-relational edges. The two main components of the model are i)HEHR unified fact representation format, and ii)HEHRGNN encoder, a GNN-based encoder with a novel message propagation model capable of capturing complex graph structures comprising both hyperedges and hyper-relational edges. The experimental results of HEHRGNN on link prediction tasks show its effectiveness as a unified embedding model, with inductive prediction capability, for link prediction across real-world datasets having different types of n-ary facts. The model also shows improved link prediction performance over baseline models for hyperedge and hyper-relational datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 Pa...</summary><p>38 Pages paper and 1 highlights page, 9 figures, 10 tables, Submitted to Elsevier Knowledge-Based Systems journal</p></details> |
| **[Are We Measuring Oversmoothing in Graph Neural Networks Correctly?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04591v4)** | 2026-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Oversmoothing is a fundamental challenge in graph neural networks (GNNs): as the number of layers increases, node embeddings become increasingly similar, and model performance drops sharply. Traditionally, oversmoothing has been quantified using metrics that measure the similarity of neighbouring node features, such as the Dirichlet energy. We argue that these metrics have critical limitations and fail to reliably capture oversmoothing in realistic scenarios. For instance, they provide meaningful insights only for very deep networks, while typical GNNs show a performance drop already with as few as 10 layers. As an alternative, we propose measuring oversmoothing by examining the numerical or effective rank of the feature representations. We provide extensive numerical evaluation across diverse graph architectures and datasets to show that rank-based metrics consistently capture oversmoothing, whereas energy-based metrics often fail. Notably, we reveal that drops in the rank align closely with performance degradation, even in scenarios where energy metrics remain unchanged. Along with the experimental evaluation, we provide theoretical support for this approach, clarifying why Dirichlet-like measures may fail to capture performance drop and proving that the numerical rank of feature representations collapses to one for a broad family of GNN architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted into ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[L2G-Net: Local to Global Spectral Graph Neural Networks via Cauchy Factorizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18837v1)** | 2026-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their theoretical advantages, spectral methods based on the graph Fourier transform (GFT) are seldom used in graph neural networks (GNNs) due to the cost of computing the eigenbasis and the lack of vertex-domain locality in spectral representations. As a result, most GNNs rely on local approximations such as polynomial Laplacian filters or message passing, which limit their ability to model long-range dependencies. In this paper, we introduce a novel factorization of the GFT into operators acting on subgraphs, which are then combined via a sequence of Cauchy matrices. We use this factorization to propose a new class of spectral GNNs, which we term L2G-Net (Local-to-Global Net). Unlike existing spectral methods, which are either fully global (when they use the GFT) or local (when they use polynomial filters), L2G-Net operates by processing the spectral representations of subgraphs and then combining them via structured matrices. Our algorithm avoids full eigendecompositions, exploiting graph topology to construct the factorization with quadratic complexity in the number of nodes, scaled by the subgraph interface size. Experiments on benchmarks stressing non-local dependencies show that L2G-Net outperforms existing spectral techniques and is competitive with the state-of-the-art with orders of magnitude fewer learnable parameters.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches based on manual curation and literature review are labour-intensive and not scalable, prompting the use of machine learning on large biomedical data. In particular, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise for modelling complex biological relationships. To address limitations in existing models, we propose GLaDiGAtor (Graph Learning-bAsed DIsease-Gene AssociaTiOn pRediction), a novel GNN framework with an encoder-decoder architecture for disease-gene association prediction. GLaDiGAtor constructs a heterogeneous biological graph integrating gene-gene, disease-disease, and gene-disease interactions from curated databases, and enriches each node with contextual features from well-known language models (ProtT5 for protein sequences and BioBERT for disease text). In evaluations, our model achieves superior predictive accuracy and generalisation, outperforming 14 existing methods. Literature-supported case studies confirm the biological relevance of high-confidence novel predictions, highlighting GLaDiGAtor's potential to discover candidate disease genes. These results underscore the power of graph convolutional networks in biomedical informatics and may ultimately facilitate drug discovery by revealing new gene-disease links.

In this work, we introduce several novel concepts and capabilities to address obstacles faced by machine-assisted theorem proving. We first present a set of \textbf{atomic tactics}, a small finite set of tactics capable of proving any provable statement in Lean. We then introduce a \textbf{transposing atomization} algorithm which turns arbitrary proof expressions into a series of atomic tactics. We next introduce the \textbf{ExprGraph} data structure, which provides a succinct representation for Lean expressions. Finally, we present the \textbf{Nazrin Prover}, a graph neural network-based theorem proving agent using atomic tactics and ExprGraph. Nazrin circumvents many challenges faced by existing proving agents by exclusively dispatching atomic tactics, and it is robust enough to both train and evaluate on consumer-grade hardware. We demonstrate the potential of tools like Nazrin using theorems from Lean's standard library and from Mathlib.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

Traditional methods often require prior knowledge and are susceptible to external disturbances. Learning-driven alternatives, while promising, frequently struggle with the scarcity of training data and fall short in generalization. To address these challenges, we propose Depth-PC, a novel visual servoing framework that leverages decoupled simulation-based training from real-world inference, achieving zero-shot Sim2Real transfer for servo tasks. To exploit spatial and geometric information of depth and point cloud features, we introduce cross-modal feature fusion, a first in servo tasks, followed by a dedicated Graph Neural Network to establish keypoint correspondences. Through simulation and real-world experiments, our approach demonstrates superior convergence basin and accuracy compared to SOTA methods, fulfilling the requirements for robotic servo tasks while enabling zero-shot Sim2Real transfer. In addition to the enhancements achieved with our proposed framework, we have also demonstrated the effectiveness of cross-modality feature fusion within the realm of servo tasks.

However, it often faces the issue of over-smoothing as the model depth increases, which causes all node representations to converge to a single value and become indistinguishable. This issue stems from the inherent limitations of GNNs, which struggle to distinguish the importance of information from different neighborhoods. In this paper, we introduce MbaGCN, a novel graph convolutional architecture that draws inspiration from the Mamba paradigm-originally designed for sequence modeling. MbaGCN presents a new backbone for GNNs, consisting of three key components: the Message Aggregation Layer, the Selective State Space Transition Layer, and the Node State Prediction Layer. These components work in tandem to adaptively aggregate neighborhood information, providing greater flexibility and scalability for deep GNN models. While MbaGCN may not consistently outperform all existing methods on each dataset, it provides a foundational framework that demonstrates the effective integration of the Mamba paradigm into graph representation learning. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that MbaGCN paves the way for future advancements in graph neural network research.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

In this work, we introduce the Complex-Valued Stuart-Landau Graph Neural Network (SLGNN), a novel architecture grounded in Stuart-Landau oscillator dynamics. Stuart-Landau oscillators are canonical models of limit-cycle behavior near Hopf bifurcations, which are fundamental to synchronization theory and are widely used in e.g. neuroscience for mesoscopic brain modeling. Unlike harmonic oscillators and phase-only Kuramoto models, Stuart-Landau oscillators retain both amplitude and phase dynamics, enabling rich phenomena such as amplitude regulation and multistable synchronization. The proposed SLGNN generalizes existing phase-centric Kuramoto-based OGNNs by allowing node feature amplitudes to evolve dynamically according to Stuart-Landau dynamics, with explicit tunable hyperparameters (such as the Hopf-parameter and the coupling strength) providing additional control over the interplay between feature amplitudes and network structure. We conduct extensive experiments across node classification, graph classification, and graph regression tasks, demonstrating that SLGNN outperforms existing OGNNs and establishes a novel, expressive, and theoretically grounded framework for deep oscillatory architectures on graphs.</p></details> |  |

Standard GNNs are limited to performing aggregation over immediate neighbourhoods or over global read-outs. To increase their expressivity, recent attempts have been made to incorporate substructural information (e.g. cycle counts and subgraph properties). In this paper, we formalize this architectural trend by introducing Template GNNs (T-GNNs), a generalized framework where node features are updated by aggregating over valid template embeddings from a specified set of graph templates. We propose a corresponding logic, Graded template modal logic (GML(T)), and generalized notions of template-based bisimulation and WL algorithm. We establish an equivalence between the expressive power of T-GNNs and GML(T), and provide a unifying approach for analysing GNN expressivity: we show how standard AC-GNNs and its recent variants can be interpreted as instantiations of T-GNNs.</p></details> |  |

However, current PIGNNs still need accuracy improvements at parity speed; in particular, the soft constraint on the physics loss is inoperative at inference, which can deter operational adoption. We address this with PIGNN-Attn-LS, combining an edge-aware attention mechanism that explicitly encodes line physics via per-edge biases to form a fully differentiable knownoperator layer inside the computation graph, with a backtracking line-search-based globalized correction operator that restores an operative decrease criterion at inference. Training and testing use a realistic High-/Medium-Voltage scenario generator, with NR used only to construct reference states. On held-out HV cases consisting of 4-32-bus grids, PIGNN-Attn-LS achieves a test RMSE of 0.00033 p.u. in voltage and 0.08 deg in angle, outperforming the PIGNN-MLP baseline by 99.5% and 87.1%, respectively.

However, they are often limited by scarce experimental property data and lack thermodynamic consistency. As such, thermodynamics-informed ML, i.e., incorporating thermodynamic relations into the loss function as regularization term for training, has been proposed. We herein transfer the concept of thermodynamics-informed graph neural networks (GNNs) from the Gibbs-Duhem to the Clapeyron equation, predicting several pure component properties in a multi-task manner, namely: vapor pressure, liquid molar volume, vapor molar volume and enthalpy of vaporization. We find improved prediction accuracy of the Clapeyron-GNN compared to the single-task learning setting, and improved approximation of the Clapeyron equation compared to the purely data-driven multi-task learning setting. In fact, we observe the largest improvement in prediction accuracy for the properties with the lowest availability of data, making our model promising for practical application in data scarce scenarios of chemical engineering practice.</p></details> |  |

Non-invasive, in-vivo measurement of these quantities can only be performed using a select number of modalities that are not widely available, such as 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this work, we create a surrogate model for hemodynamic flow field estimation, powered by machine learning. We train graph neural networks that include priors about the underlying symmetries and physics, limiting the amount of data required for training. This allows us to train the model using moderately-sized, in-vivo 4D flow MRI datasets, instead of large in-silico datasets obtained by computational fluid dynamics (CFD), as is the current standard. We create an efficient, equivariant neural network by combining the popular PointNet++ architecture with group-steerable layers. To incorporate the physics-informed priors, we derive an efficient discretisation scheme for the involved differential operators. We perform extensive experiments in carotid arteries and show that our model can accurately estimate low-noise hemodynamic flow fields in the carotid artery. Moreover, we show how the learned relation between geometry and hemodynamic quantities transfers to 3D vascular models obtained using a different imaging modality than the training data. This shows that physics-informed graph neural networks can be trained using 4D flow MRI data to estimate blood flow in unseen carotid artery geometries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in "Medical Image Analysis"</p></details> |
| **[Stable Long-Horizon Spatiotemporal Prediction on Meshes Using Latent Multiscale Recurrent Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18146v1)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate long-horizon prediction of spatiotemporal fields on complex geometries is a fundamental challenge in scientific machine learning, with applications such as additive manufacturing where temperature histories govern defect formation and mechanical properties. High-fidelity simulations are accurate but computationally costly, and despite recent advances, machine learning methods remain challenged by long-horizon temperature and gradient prediction. We propose a deep learning framework for predicting full temperature histories directly on meshes, conditioned on geometry and process parameters, while maintaining stability over thousands of time steps and generalizing across heterogeneous geometries. The framework adopts a temporal multiscale architecture composed of two coupled models operating at complementary time scales. Both models rely on a latent recurrent graph neural network to capture spatiotemporal dynamics on meshes, while a variational graph autoencoder provides a compact latent representation that reduces memory usage and improves training stability. Experiments on simulated powder bed fusion data demonstrate accurate and temporally stable long-horizon predictions across diverse geometries, outperforming existing baseline. Although evaluated in two dimensions, the framework is general and extensible to physics-driven systems with multiscale dynamics and to three-dimensional geometries.</p></details> |  |

Existing remedies such as graph transformers or rewiring typically incur high computational cost or require altering the graph structure. We introduce a Bakry-Emery graph Laplacian that integrates diffusion and advection through a learnable node-wise potential, inducing task-dependent propagation dynamics without modifying topology. This operator has a well-behaved spectral decomposition and acts as a drop-in replacement for standard Laplacians in spectral GNNs. Building on this insight, we develop mu-ChebNet, a spectral architecture that jointly learns the potential and Chebyshev filters, effectively bridging message-passing adaptivity and spectral efficiency. Our theoretical analysis shows how the potential modulates the spectrum, enabling control of key graph properties. Empirically, mu-ChebNet delivers consistent gains on synthetic long-range reasoning tasks, as well as real-world benchmarks, while offering an interpretable routing field that reveals how information flows through the graph. This establishes the Bakry-Emery Laplacian as a principled and efficient foundation for adaptive spectral graph learning.</p></details> |  |

Understanding and decoding cognitive brain states from fMRI depends on how functional interactions are represented. We propose an ensemble-based graph representation in which each edge weight encodes state evidence as the difference between posterior probabilities of two states, estimated by an ensemble of edge-wise probabilistic classifiers from simple pairwise time-series features. We evaluate the method on seven task-fMRI paradigms from the Human Connectome Project, performing binary classification within each paradigm. Using compact node summaries (mean incident edge weights) and logistic regression, we obtain average accuracies of 97.07-99.74 %. We further compare ensemble graphs with conventional correlation graphs using the same graph neural network classifier; ensemble graphs consistently yield higher accuracy (88.00-99.42 % vs 61.86-97.94 % across tasks). Because edge weights have a probabilistic, state-oriented interpretation, the representation supports connection- and region-level interpretability and can be extended to multiclass decoding, regression, other neuroimaging modalities, and clinical classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Simple Graphs: Neural Multi-Objective Routing on Multigraphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22095v5)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning-based methods for routing have gained significant attention in recent years, both in single-objective and multi-objective contexts. Yet, existing methods are unsuitable for routing on multigraphs, which feature multiple edges with distinct attributes between node pairs, despite their strong relevance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose two graph neural network-based methods to address multi-objective routing on multigraphs. Our first approach operates directly on the multigraph by autoregressively selecting edges until a tour is completed. The second model, which is more scalable, first simplifies the multigraph via a learned pruning strategy and then performs autoregressive routing on the resulting simple graph. We evaluate both models empirically, across a wide range of problems and graph distributions, and demonstrate their competitive performance compared to strong heuristics and neural baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026, Final Camera-Ready Version. 34 pages, 6 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Co-Evolution-Based Metal-Binding Residue Prediction with Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16189v2)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding protein-metal interactions is central to structural biology, with metal ions being vital for catalysis, stability, and signal transduction. Predicting metal-binding residues and metal types remains challenging due to the structural and evolutionary complexity of proteins. Conventional sequence- and structure-based methods often fail to capture co-evolutionary constraints that reflect how residues evolve together to maintain metal-binding functionality. Recent co-evolution-based methods capture part of this information, but still underutilize the complete co-evolved residue network. To address this limitation, we introduce the Metal-Binding Graph Neural Network (MBGNN), which leverages the complete co-evolved residue network to better capture complex dependencies within protein structures. Experimental results show that MBGNN substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art co-evolution-based method MetalNet2, achieving F1 score improvements of 2.5% for binding residue identification and 3.3% for metal type classification on the MetalNet2 dataset. Its superiority is further demonstrated on both the MetalNet2 and MIonSite datasets, where it outperforms two co-evolution-based and two sequence-based methods, achieving the highest mean F1 scores across both prediction tasks. These findings highlight how integrating co-evolutionary residue networks with graph-based learning advances our ability to decode protein-metal interactions, thereby facilitating functional annotation and rational metalloprotein design. The code and data are released at https://github.com/SRastegari/MBGNN.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

We demonstrate this capability on an instance of the CANOS-PF graph neural network model, as implemented by the PF$Δ$ benchmark library, operating on a 14-bus test grid. Generated adversarial points yield errors as large as 3.4 per-unit in reactive power and 0.08 per-unit in voltage magnitude. When minimizing the perturbation from a training point necessary to satisfy adversarial constraints, we find that the constraints can be met with as little as an 0.04 per-unit perturbation in voltage magnitude on a single bus. This work motivates the development of rigorous verification and robust training methods for neural network surrogate models of AC power flow.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph-Neural Multi-Agent Coordination for Distributed Access-Point Selection in Cell-Free Massive MIMO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17954v1)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cell-free massive MIMO (CFmMIMO) systems require scalable and reliable distributed coordination mechanisms to operate under stringent communication and latency constraints. A central challenge is the Access Point Selection (APS) problem, which seeks to determine the subset of serving Access Points (APs) for each User Equipment (UE) that can satisfy UEs' Spectral Efficiency (SE) requirements while minimizing network power consumption. We introduce APS-GNN, a scalable distributed multi-agent learning framework that decomposes APS into agents operating at the granularity of individual AP-UE connections. Agents coordinate via local observation exchange over a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture and share parameters to reuse their knowledge and experience. APS-GNN adopts a constrained reinforcement learning approach to provide agents with explicit observability of APS' conflicting objectives, treating SE satisfaction as a cost and power reduction as a reward. Both signals are defined locally, facilitating effective credit assignment and scalable coordination in large networks. To further improve training stability and exploration efficiency, the policy is initialized via supervised imitation learning from a heuristic APS baseline. We develop a realistic CFmMIMO simulator and demonstrate that APS-GNN delivers the target SE while activating 50-70% fewer APs than heuristic and centralized Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) baselines in different evaluation scenarios. Moreover, APS-GNN achieves one to two orders of magnitude lower inference latency than centralized MARL approaches due to its fully parallel and distributed execution. These results establish APS-GNN as a practical and scalable solution for APS in large-scale CFmMIMO networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under submission to an IEEE journal</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Graph Causal Classification Models: Estimating Causal Effects and Addressing Confounders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17941v1)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph data is becoming increasingly prevalent due to the growing demand for relational insights in AI across various domains. Organizations regularly use graph data to solve complex problems involving relationships and connections. Causal learning is especially important in this context, since it helps to understand cause-effect relationships rather than mere associations. Since many real-world systems are inherently causal, graphs can efficiently model these systems. However, traditional graph machine learning methods including graph neural networks (GNNs), rely on correlations and are sensitive to spurious patterns and distribution changes. On the other hand, causal models enable robust predictions by isolating true causal factors, thus making them more stable under such shifts. Causal learning also helps in identifying and adjusting for confounders, ensuring that predictions reflect true causal relationships and remain accurate even under interventions. To address these challenges and build models that are robust and causally informed, we propose CCAGNN, a Confounder-Aware causal GNN framework that incorporates causal reasoning into graph learning, supporting counterfactual reasoning and providing reliable predictions in real-world settings. Comprehensive experiments on six publicly available datasets from diverse domains show that CCAGNN consistently outperforms leading state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Neighbourhood Learning for Invariant Graph Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17934v1)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph data often contain noisy and spurious correlations that mask the true causal relationships, which are essential for enabling graph models to make predictions based on the underlying causal structure of the data. Dependence on spurious connections makes it challenging for traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generalize effectively across different graphs. Furthermore, traditional aggregation methods tend to amplify these spurious patterns, limiting model robustness under distribution shifts. To address these issues, we propose Causal Neighbourhood Learning with Graph Neural Networks (CNL-GNN), a novel framework that performs causal interventions on graph structure. CNL-GNN effectively identifies and preserves causally relevant connections and reduces spurious influences through the generation of counterfactual neighbourhoods and adaptive edge perturbation guided by learnable importance masking and an attention-based mechanism. In addition, by combining structural-level interventions with the disentanglement of causal features from confounding factors, the model learns invariant node representations that are robust and generalize well across different graph structures. Our approach improves causal graph learning beyond traditional feature-based methods, resulting in a robust classification model. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets, including multiple domain variants of one dataset, demonstrate that CNL-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art GNN models.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViGText: Deepfake Image Detection with Vision-Language Model Explanations and Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18031v2)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid rise of deepfake technology, which produces realistic but fraudulent digital content, threatens the authenticity of media. Traditional deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes. Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes, helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.</p></details> |  |
| **[COMBA: Cross Batch Aggregation for Learning Large Graphs with Context Gating State Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17893v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State space models (SSMs) have recently emerged for modeling long-range dependency in sequence data, with much simplified computational costs than modern alternatives, such as transformers. Advancing SMMs to graph structured data, especially for large graphs, is a significant challenge because SSMs are sequence models and the shear graph volumes make it very expensive to convert graphs as sequences for effective learning. In this paper, we propose COMBA to tackle large graph learning using state space models, with two key innovations: graph context gating and cross batch aggregation. Graph context refers to different hops of neighborhood for each node, and graph context gating allows COMBA to use such context to learn best control of neighbor aggregation. For each graph context, COMBA samples nodes as batches, and train a graph neural network (GNN), with information being aggregated cross batches, allowing COMBA to scale to large graphs. Our theoretical study asserts that cross-batch aggregation guarantees lower error than training GNN without aggregation. Experiments on benchmark networks demonstrate significant performance gains compared to baseline approaches. Code and benchmark datasets will be released for public access.</p></details> |  |

While decentralized protocols increasingly adopt zero-knowledge proofs to obfuscate transaction graphs, centralized stablecoins remain critical "transparent choke points" for compliance. Leveraging this persistent visibility, this study analyzes an Ethereum dataset and uses behavioral features to develop a robust AML framework. Our findings demonstrate that domain-informed tree ensemble models achieve higher Macro-F1 score, significantly outperforming graph neural networks, which struggle with the increasing fragmentation of transaction networks. The model's interpretability goes beyond binary detection, successfully dissecting distinct typologies: it differentiates the complex, high-velocity dispersion of cybercrime syndicates from the constrained, static footprints left by sanctioned entities. This framework aligns with the industry shift toward deterministic verification, satisfying the auditability and compliance expectations under regulations such as the EU's MiCA and the U.S. GENIUS Act while minimizing unjustified asset freezes. By automating high-precision detection, we propose an approach that effectively raises the economic cost of financial misconduct without stifling innovation.</p></details> | 27 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Graph Neural Model Predictive Control for High-Dimensional Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17601v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The control of high-dimensional systems, such as soft robots, requires models that faithfully capture complex dynamics while remaining computationally tractable. This work presents a framework that integrates Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based dynamics models with structure-exploiting Model Predictive Control to enable real-time control of high-dimensional systems. By representing the system as a graph with localized interactions, the GNN preserves sparsity, while a tailored condensing algorithm eliminates state variables from the control problem, ensuring efficient computation. The complexity of our condensing algorithm scales linearly with the number of system nodes, and leverages Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) parallelization to achieve real-time performance. The proposed approach is validated in simulation and experimentally on a physical soft robotic trunk. Results show that our method scales to systems with up to 1,000 nodes at 100 Hz in closed-loop, and demonstrates real-time reference tracking on hardware with sub-centimeter accuracy, outperforming baselines by 63.6%. Finally, we show the capability of our method to achieve effective full-body obstacle avoidance.</p></details> |  |

While GNNs have demonstrated broad applicability, understanding their expressive power remains an important question. In this paper, we propose GNN architectures that correspond precisely to prominent fragments of first-order logic (FO), including various modal logics as well as more expressive two-variable fragments. To establish these results, we apply methods from finite model theory of first-order and modal logics to the domain of graph representation learning. Our results provide a unifying framework for understanding the logical expressiveness of GNNs within FO.</p></details> | 21 pages |

Recent advances in graph OOD detection have focused on test-time training techniques that facilitate OOD detection without accessing potential supervisory information (e.g., training data). However, most of these methods employ a one-pass inference paradigm, which prevents them from progressively correcting erroneous predictions to amplify OOD signals. To this end, we propose a \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{I}mproving \textbf{G}raph \textbf{O}ut-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{D}istribution detector (SIGOOD), which is an unsupervised framework that integrates continuous self-learning with test-time training for effective graph OOD detection. Specifically, SIGOOD generates a prompt to construct a prompt-enhanced graph that amplifies potential OOD signals. To optimize prompts, SIGOOD introduces an Energy Preference Optimization (EPO) loss, which leverages energy variations between the original test graph and the prompt-enhanced graph. By iteratively optimizing the prompt by involving it into the detection model in a self-improving loop, the resulting optimal prompt-enhanced graph is ultimately used for OOD detection. Comprehensive evaluations on 21 real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness and outperformance of our SIGOOD method. The code is at https://github.com/Ee1s/SIGOOD.</p></details> | 9pages, 5 figures |

To address this gap, we study an aggregate-and-readout model that encompasses several common message passing architectures: node features are first propagated over the graph then mapped to responses via a nonlinear function. For least-squares estimation over GNNs with linear graph convolutions and a deep ReLU readout, we prove a sharp non-asymptotic risk bound that separates approximation, stochastic, and optimization errors. The bound makes explicit how performance scales with the fraction of labeled nodes and graph-induced dependence. Approximation guarantees are further derived for graph-smoothing followed by smooth nonlinear readouts, yielding convergence rates that recover classical nonparametric behavior under full supervision while characterizing performance when labels are scarce. Numerical experiments validate our theory, providing a systematic framework for understanding GNN performance and limitations.</p></details> | 57 pages, 7 figures |

However, it remains unclear when multi-hop structural reasoning is actually necessary. In this work, we introduce locality radius, a formal measure of the minimum structural neighborhood required to determine a prediction in relational schemas. We hypothesize that model performance depends critically on alignment between task locality radius and architectural aggregation depth. We conduct a controlled empirical study across foreign key prediction, join cost estimation, blast radius regression, cascade impact classification, and additional graph-derived schema tasks. Our evaluation includes multi-seed experiments, capacity-matched comparisons, statistical significance testing, scaling analysis, and synthetic radius-controlled benchmarks. Results reveal a consistent bias-radius alignment effect.</p></details> |  |

To address these systemic vulnerabilities, we present AdvSynGNN, a comprehensive architecture designed for resilient node-level representation learning. The proposed framework orchestrates multi-resolution structural synthesis alongside contrastive objectives to establish geometry-sensitive initializations. We develop a transformer backbone that adaptively accommodates heterophily by modulating attention mechanisms through learned topological signals. Central to our contribution is an integrated adversarial propagation engine, where a generative component identifies potential connectivity alterations while a discriminator enforces global coherence. Furthermore, label refinement is achieved through a residual correction scheme guided by per-node confidence metrics, which facilitates precise control over iterative stability. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that this synergistic approach effectively optimizes predictive accuracy across diverse graph distributions while maintaining computational efficiency. The study concludes with practical implementation protocols to ensure the robust deployment of the AdvSynGNN system in large-scale environments.</p></details> | 32 pages, 8 figures |

While self-explainable GNNs attempt to bridge this gap, they often rely on standard message-passing backbones that inherit fundamental limitations, including the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) expressivity barrier and a lack of fine-grained interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose SymGraph, a symbolic framework designed to transcend these constraints. By replacing continuous message passing with discrete structural hashing and topological role-based aggregation, our architecture theoretically surpasses the 1-WL barrier, achieving superior expressiveness without the overhead of differentiable optimization. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that SymGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing self-explainable GNNs. Notably, SymGraph delivers 10x to 100x speedups in training time using only CPU execution. Furthermore, SymGraph generates rules with superior semantic granularity compared to existing rule-based methods, offering great potential for scientific discovery and explainable AI.</p></details> | 23 pages, 9 pages |
| **[Predicting The Cop Number Using Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16600v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cops and Robbers is a pursuit evasion game played on a graph, first introduced independently by Quilliot \cite{quilliot1978jeux} and Nowakowski and Winkler \cite{NOWAKOWSKI1983235} over four decades ago. A main interest in recent the literature is identifying the cop number of graph families. The cop number of a graph, $c(G)$, is defined as the minimum number of cops required to guarantee capture of the robber. Determining the cop number is computationally difficult and exact algorithms for this are typically restricted to small graph families. This paper investigates whether classical machine learning methods and graph neural networks can accurately predict a graph's cop number from its structural properties and identify which properties most strongly influence this prediction. Of the classical machine learning models, tree-based models achieve high accuracy in prediction despite class imbalance, whereas graph neural networks achieve comparable results without explicit feature engineering. The interpretability analysis shows that the most predictive features are related to node connectivity, clustering, clique structure, and width parameters, which aligns with known theoretical results. Our findings suggest that machine learning approaches can be used in complement with existing cop number algorithms by offering scalable approximations where computation is infeasible.</p></details> | 8 pages |

We utilise an artificial cochlea that converts time-series signals into sparse event data, reducing memory and computation costs. Our architecture was implemented on a SoC FPGA and evaluated on two open-source datasets. For classification task, our baseline floating-point model achieves 92.7% accuracy on SHD dataset - only 2.4% below the state of the art - while requiring over 10x and 67x fewer parameters. On SSC, our models achieve 66.9-71.0% accuracy.

This concept is developed within a one-dimensional framework as a foundational step. Traditional numerical methods, while effective, are computationally intensive and less scalable. By utilizing GNNs, the proposed model, termed the Collision-captured Network (CN), integrates data assimilation (DA) techniques to effectively learn and predict sea ice dynamics under various conditions. The approach was validated using synthetic data, both with and without observed data points, and it was found that the model accelerates the simulation of trajectories without compromising accuracy. This advancement offers a more efficient tool for forecasting in marginal ice zones (MIZ) and highlights the potential of combining machine learning with data assimilation for more effective and efficient modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating GNN Convergence on Large Randomly Generated Graphs with Realistic Node Feature Correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16145v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are a number of existing studies analysing the convergence behaviour of graph neural networks on large random graphs. Unfortunately, the majority of these studies do not model correlations between node features, which would naturally exist in a variety of real-life networks. Consequently, the derived limitations of GNNs, resulting from such convergence behaviour, is not truly reflective of the expressive power of GNNs when applied to realistic graphs. In this paper, we will introduce a novel method to generate random graphs that have correlated node features. The node features will be sampled in such a manner to ensure correlation between neighbouring nodes. As motivation for our choice of sampling scheme, we will appeal to properties exhibited by real-life graphs, particularly properties that are captured by the Barabási-Albert model. A theoretical analysis will strongly indicate that convergence can be avoided in some cases, which we will empirically validate on large random graphs generated using our novel method. The observed divergent behaviour provides evidence that GNNs may be more expressive than initial studies would suggest, especially on realistic graphs.</p></details> | 8 pages, 1 figure |

Existing approaches face fundamental limitations: they cannot effectively share intelligence across borders due to privacy constraints, lack reasoning capabilities to understand complex multi-step attack patterns, and fail to capture intricate graph-structured relationships in financial networks. We introduce FedGraph-AGI, a novel federated learning framework integrating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) reasoning with graph neural networks for privacy-preserving cross-border insider threat detection. Our approach combines: (1) federated graph neural networks preserving data sovereignty; (2) Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) aggregation for heterogeneous jurisdictions; and (3) AGI-powered reasoning via Large Action Models (LAM) performing causal inference over graph data. Through experiments on a 50,000-transaction dataset across 10 jurisdictions, FedGraph-AGI achieves 92.3% accuracy, significantly outperforming federated baselines (86.1%) and centralized approaches (84.7%). Our ablation studies reveal AGI reasoning contributes 6.8% improvement, while MoE adds 4.4%. The system maintains epsilon = 1.0 differential privacy while achieving near-optimal performance and scales efficiently to 50+ clients. This represents the first integration of AGI reasoning with federated graph learning for insider threat detection, opening new directions for privacy-preserving cross-border intelligence sharing.</p></details> | 35 Pages, 8 figures |

While generative modeling has revolutionized structure discovery for molecules, inorganic solids, and metal-organic frameworks, extending such approaches to fully periodic molecular crystals is still elusive. Here, we present MolCrystalFlow, a flow-based generative model for molecular crystal structure prediction. The framework disentangles intramolecular complexity from intermolecular packing by embedding molecules as rigid bodies and jointly learning the lattice matrix, molecular orientations, and centroid positions. Centroids and orientations are represented on their native Riemannian manifolds, allowing geodesic flow construction and graph neural network operations that respects geometric symmetries. We benchmark our model against state-of-the-art generative models for large-size periodic crystals and rule-based structure generation methods on two open-source molecular crystal datasets. We demonstrate an integration of MolCrystalFlow model with universal machine learning potential to accelerate molecular crystal structure prediction, paving the way for data-driven generative discovery of molecular crystals.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

In this work, we introduce a fully quantum graph convolutional architecture designed explicitly for unsupervised learning in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) regime. Our approach combines a variational quantum feature extraction layer with an edge-local and qubit-efficient quantum message-passing mechanism inspired by the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) framework. Unlike prior models that rely on global operations or multi-controlled unitaries, our model decomposes message passing into pairwise interactions along graph edges using only hardware-native single- and two-qubit gates. This design reduces the qubit requirement from $O(Nn)$ to $O(n)$ for a graph with $N$ nodes and $n$-qubit feature registers, enabling implementation on current quantum devices regardless of graph size. We train the model using the Deep Graph Infomax objective to perform unsupervised node representation learning. Experiments on the Cora citation network and a large-scale genomic SNP dataset demonstrate that our model remains competitive with prior quantum and hybrid approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-Intrusive Graph-Based Bot Detection for E-Commerce Using Inductive Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22579v6)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Malicious bots pose a growing threat to e-commerce platforms by scraping data, hoarding inventory, and perpetrating fraud. Traditional bot mitigation techniques, including IP blacklists and CAPTCHA-based challenges, are increasingly ineffective or intrusive, as modern bots leverage proxies, botnets, and AI-assisted evasion strategies. This work proposes a non-intrusive graph-based bot detection framework for e-commerce that models user session behavior through a graph representation and applies an inductive graph neural network for classification. The approach captures both relational structure and behavioral semantics, enabling accurate identification of subtle automated activity that evades feature-based methods. Experiments on real-world e-commerce traffic demonstrate that the proposed inductive graph model outperforms a strong session-level multilayer perceptron baseline in terms of AUC and F1 score. Additional adversarial perturbation and cold-start simulations show that the model remains robust under moderate graph modifications and generalizes effectively to previously unseen sessions and URLs. The proposed framework is deployment-friendly, integrates with existing systems without client-side instrumentation, and supports real-time inference and incremental updates, making it suitable for practical e-commerce security deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenDA: Generative Data Assimilation on Complex Urban Areas via Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11440v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban wind flow reconstruction is essential for assessing air quality, heat dispersion, and pedestrian comfort, yet remains challenging when only sparse sensor data are available. We propose GenDA, a generative data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-resolution wind fields on unstructured meshes from limited observations. The model employs a multiscale graph-based diffusion architecture trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and interprets classifier-free guidance as a learned posterior reconstruction mechanism: the unconditional branch learns a geometry-aware flow prior, while the sensor-conditioned branch injects observational constraints during sampling. This formulation enables obstacle-aware reconstruction and generalization across unseen geometries, wind directions, and mesh resolutions without retraining. We consider both sparse fixed sensors and trajectory-based observations using the same reconstruction procedure. When evaluated against supervised graph neural network (GNN) baselines and classical reduced-order data assimilation methods, GenDA reduces the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) by 25-57% and increases the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 23-33% across the tested meshes. Experiments are conducted on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of a real urban neighbourhood in Bristol, United Kingdom, at a characteristic Reynolds number of $\mathrm{Re}\approx2\times10^{7}$, featuring complex building geometry and irregular terrain. The proposed framework provides a scalable path toward generative, geometry-aware data assimilation for environmental monitoring in complex domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Code Smell Refactoring Approach using GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12069v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code smell is a great challenge in software refactoring, which indicates latent design or implementation flaws that may degrade the software maintainability and evolution. Over the past decades, a variety of refactoring approaches have been proposed, which can be broadly classified into metrics-based, rule-based, and machine learning-based approaches. Recent years, deep learning-based approaches have also attracted widespread attention. However, existing techniques exhibit various limitations. Metrics- and rule-based approaches rely heavily on manually defined heuristics and thresholds, whereas deep learning-based approaches are often constrained by dataset availability and model design. In this study, we proposed a graph-based deep learning approach for code smell refactoring. Specifically, we designed two types of input graphs (class-level and method-level) and employed both graph classification and node classification tasks to address the refactoring of three representative code smells: long method, large class, and feature envy. In our experiment, we propose a semi-automated dataset generation approach that could generate a large-scale dataset with minimal manual effort. We implemented the proposed approach with three classical GNN (graph neural network) architectures: GCN, GraphSAGE, and GAT, and evaluated its performance against both traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. The results demonstrate that proposed approach achieves superior refactoring performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond ReLU: Bifurcation, Oversmoothing, and Topological Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15634v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) learn node representations through iterative network-based message-passing. While powerful, deep GNNs suffer from oversmoothing, where node features converge to a homogeneous, non-informative state. We re-frame this problem of representational collapse from a \emph{bifurcation theory} perspective, characterizing oversmoothing as convergence to a stable ``homogeneous fixed point.'' Our central contribution is the theoretical discovery that this undesired stability can be broken by replacing standard monotone activations (e.g., ReLU) with a class of functions. Using Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, we analytically prove that this substitution induces a bifurcation that destabilizes the homogeneous state and creates a new pair of stable, non-homogeneous \emph{patterns} that provably resist oversmoothing. Our theory predicts a precise, nontrivial scaling law for the amplitude of these emergent patterns, which we quantitatively validate in experiments. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our theory by deriving a closed-form, bifurcation-aware initialization and showing its utility in real benchmark experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Geometric Coherence of Global Aggregation in Federated GNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15510v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed training across multiple clients without centralized data sharing, while Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) model relational data through message passing. In federated GNN settings, client graphs often exhibit heterogeneous structural and propagation characteristics. When standard aggregation mechanisms are applied to such heterogeneous updates, the global model may converge numerically while exhibiting degraded relational behavior.Our work identifies a geometric failure mode of global aggregation in Cross- Domain Federated GNNs. Although GNN parameters are numerically represented as vectors, they encode relational transformations that govern the direction, strength, and sensitivity of information flow across graph neighborhoods. Aggregating updates originating from incompatible propagation regimes can therefore introduce destructive interference in this transformation space.This leads to loss of coherence in global message passing. Importantly, this degradation is not necessarily reflected in conventional metrics such as loss or accuracy.To address this issue, we propose GGRS (Global Geometric Reference Structure), a server-side framework that regulates client updates prior to aggregation based on geometric admissibility criteria. GGRS preserves directional consistency of relational transformations as well as maintains diversity of admissible propagation subspaces. It also stabilizes sensitivity to neighborhood interactions, without accessing client data or graph topology. Experiments on heterogeneous GNN-native, Amazon Co-purchase datasets demonstrate that GGRS preserves global message-passing coherence across training rounds by highlighting the necessity of geometry-aware regulation in federated graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a developing preprint of an 18-page journal manuscript (6 figures), currently being prepared for formal peer-review submission</p></details> |
| **[NeuroLifting: Neural Inference on Markov Random Fields at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18954v3)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference in large-scale Markov Random Fields (MRFs) is a critical yet challenging task, traditionally approached through approximate methods like belief propagation and mean field, or exact methods such as the Toulbar2 solver. These strategies often fail to strike an optimal balance between efficiency and solution quality, particularly as the problem scale increases. This paper introduces NeuroLifting, a novel technique that leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to reparameterize decision variables in MRFs, facilitating the use of standard gradient descent optimization. By extending traditional lifting techniques into a non-parametric neural network framework, NeuroLifting benefits from the smooth loss landscape of neural networks, enabling efficient and parallelizable optimization. Empirical results demonstrate that, on moderate scales, NeuroLifting performs very close to the exact solver Toulbar2 in terms of solution quality, significantly surpassing existing approximate methods. Notably, on large-scale MRFs, NeuroLifting delivers superior solution quality against all baselines, as well as exhibiting linear computational complexity growth. This work presents a significant advancement in MRF inference, offering a scalable and effective solution for large-scale problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Size Transferability of Graph Transformers with Convolutional Positional Encodings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15239v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have achieved remarkable success across domains, motivating the rise of Graph Transformers (GTs) as attention-based architectures for graph-structured data. A key design choice in GTs is the use of Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based positional encodings to incorporate structural information. In this work, we study GTs through the lens of manifold limit models for graph sequences and establish a theoretical connection between GTs with GNN positional encodings and Manifold Neural Networks (MNNs). Building on transferability results for GNNs under manifold convergence, we show that GTs inherit transferability guarantees from their positional encodings. In particular, GTs trained on small graphs provably generalize to larger graphs under mild assumptions. We complement our theory with extensive experiments on standard graph benchmarks, demonstrating that GTs exhibit scalable behavior on par with GNNs. To further show the efficiency in a real-world scenario, we implement GTs for shortest path distance estimation over terrains to better illustrate the efficiency of the transferable GTs. Our results provide new insights into the understanding of GTs and suggest practical directions for efficient training of GTs in large-scale settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grappa: Gradient-Only Communication for Scalable Graph Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01872v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-partition edges dominate the cost of distributed GNN training: fetching remote features and activations per iteration overwhelms the network as graphs deepen and partition counts grow. Grappa is a distributed GNN training framework that enforces gradient-only communication: during each iteration, partitions train in isolation and exchange only gradients for the global update. To recover accuracy lost to isolation, Grappa (i) periodically repartitions to expose new neighborhoods and (ii) applies a lightweight coverage-corrected gradient aggregation inspired by importance sampling. We present an asymptotically unbiased estimator for gradient correction, which we use to develop a minimum-distance batch-level variant that is compatible with common deep-learning packages. We also introduce a shrinkage version that improves stability in practice. Empirical results on real and synthetic graphs show that Grappa trains GNNs 4x faster on average (up to 13x) than state-of-the-art systems, achieves better accuracy especially for deeper models, and sustains training at the trillion-edge scale on commodity hardware. Grappa is model-agnostic, supports full-graph and mini-batch training, and does not rely on high-bandwidth interconnects or caching.</p></details> |  |
| **[iQUEST: An Iterative Question-Guided Framework for Knowledge Base Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01784v6)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in many natural language processing tasks but often exhibit factual inconsistencies in knowledge-intensive settings. Integrating external knowledge resources, particularly knowledge graphs (KGs), provides a transparent and updatable foundation for more reliable reasoning. Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA), which queries and reasons over KGs, is central to this effort, especially for complex, multi-hop queries. However, multi-hop reasoning poses two key challenges: (1)~maintaining coherent reasoning paths, and (2)~avoiding prematurely discarding critical multi-hop connections. To tackle these challenges, we introduce iQUEST, a question-guided KBQA framework that iteratively decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions, ensuring a structured and focused reasoning trajectory. Additionally, we integrate a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to look ahead and incorporate 2-hop neighbor information at each reasoning step. This dual approach strengthens the reasoning process, enabling the model to explore viable paths more effectively. Detailed experiments demonstrate the consistent improvement delivered by iQUEST across four benchmark datasets and four LLMs. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/Wangshuaiia/iQUEST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 63rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2025), Main Track</p></details> |

The ML-for-combinatorial-optimization community has focused on learning to \emph{replace} solvers, yet recent evidence shows that graph neural networks (GNNs) rarely outperform well-tuned classical methods on standard benchmarks. We pursue a different objective: learning to predict \emph{when} a given instance is hard for greedy allocation, enabling instance-dependent algorithm selection. We design a 20-dimensional structural feature vector and train a lightweight MLP hardness classifier that predicts the greedy optimality gap with mean absolute error 0.033, Pearson correlation 0.937, and binary classification accuracy 94.7\% across three random seeds. For instances identified as hard -- those exhibiting ``whale-fish'' trap structure where greedy provably fails -- we deploy a heterogeneous GNN specialist that achieves ${\approx}0\%$ optimality gap on all six adversarial configurations tested (vs.\ 3.75--59.24\% for greedy). A hybrid allocator combining the hardness classifier with GNN and greedy solvers achieves 0.51\% overall gap on mixed distributions. Our honest evaluation on CATS benchmarks confirms that GNNs do not outperform Gurobi (0.45--0.71 vs.\ 0.20 gap), motivating the algorithm selection framing. Learning \emph{when} to deploy expensive solvers is more tractable than learning to replace them.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Cosmic Void Finding with Graph Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14630v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cosmic voids contain higher-order cosmological information and are of interest for astroparticle physics. Finding genuine matter underdensities in sparse galaxy surveys is, however, an underconstrained problem. Traditional void finding algorithms produce deterministic void catalogs, neglecting the probabilistic nature of the problem. We present a method to sample from the stochastic mapping from galaxy catalogs to arbitrary void definitions. Our algorithm uses a deep graph neural network to evolve "test particles" according to a flow-matching objective. We demonstrate the method in a simplified example setting but outline steps to generalize it towards practically usable void finders. Trained on a deterministic teacher, the model performs well but has considerable stochasticity which we interpret as regularization. Cosmological information in the predicted void catalogs outperforms the teacher. On the one hand, our method can cheaply emulate existing void finders with apparently useful regularization. More importantly, it also allows us to find the Bayes-optimal mapping between observed galaxies and any void definition. This includes definitions operating at the level of simulated matter density and velocity fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+3 p...</summary><p>8+3 pages, 9+2 figures.

Distilling Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) teachers into Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) students has emerged as an effective approach to achieve strong performance and reducing computational cost by removing graph dependency. However, existing distillation methods only use standard GNNs and overlook alternative teachers such as specialized model for link prediction (GNN4LP) and heuristic methods (e.g., common neighbors). This paper first explores the impact of different teachers in GNN-to-MLP distillation. Surprisingly, we find that stronger teachers do not always produce stronger students: MLPs distilled from GNN4LP can underperform those distilled from simpler GNNs, while weaker heuristic methods can teach MLPs to near-GNN performance with drastically reduced training costs. Building on these insights, we propose Ensemble Heuristic-Distilled MLPs (EHDM), which eliminates graph dependencies while effectively integrating complementary signals via a gating mechanism. Experiments on ten datasets show an average 7.93% improvement over previous GNN-to-MLP approaches with 1.95-3.32 times less training time, indicating EHDM is an efficient and effective link prediction method.

| **[Whom to Query for What: Adaptive Group Elicitation via Multi-Turn LLM Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14279v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Eliciting information to reduce uncertainty about latent group-level properties from surveys and other collective assessments requires allocating limited questioning effort under real costs and missing data. Although large language models enable adaptive, multi-turn interactions in natural language, most existing elicitation methods optimize what to ask with a fixed respondent pool, and do not adapt respondent selection or leverage population structure when responses are partial or incomplete. To address this gap, we study adaptive group elicitation, a multi-round setting where an agent adaptively selects both questions and respondents under explicit query and participation budgets. We propose a theoretically grounded framework that combines (i) an LLM-based expected information gain objective for scoring candidate questions with (ii) heterogeneous graph neural network propagation that aggregates observed responses and participant attributes to impute missing responses and guide per-round respondent selection. This closed-loop procedure queries a small, informative subset of individuals while inferring population-level responses via structured similarity. Across three real-world opinion datasets, our method consistently improves population-level response prediction under constrained budgets, including a >12% relative gain on CES at a 10% respondent budget.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid TGN-SEAL Model for Dynamic Graph Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14239v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting links in sparse, continuously evolving networks is a central challenge in network science. Conventional heuristic methods and deep learning models, including Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are typically designed for static graphs and thus struggle to capture temporal dependencies. Snapshot-based techniques partially address this issue but often encounter data sparsity and class imbalance, particularly in networks with transient interactions such as telecommunication call detail records (CDRs). Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) model dynamic graphs by updating node embeddings over time; however, their predictive accuracy under sparse conditions remains limited. In this study, we improve the TGN framework by extracting enclosing subgraphs around candidate links, enabling the model to jointly learn structural and temporal information. Experiments on a sparse CDR dataset show that our approach increases average precision by 2.6% over standard TGNs, demonstrating the advantages of integrating local topology for robust link prediction in dynamic networks.</p></details> |  |

These graphs provide a hierarchical metric-semantic representation in which such concepts are organized. To further enhance graph-SLAM performance, Factorized 3D Scene Graphs incorporate these concepts as optimization factors that constrain relative geometry and enforce global consistency. However, both stages of this process remain largely manual: concepts are typically derived using hand-crafted, concept-specific heuristics, while factors and their covariances are likewise manually designed. This reliance on manual specification limits generalization across diverse environments and scalability to new concept classes. This paper presents a novel learning-based method that infers spatial concepts online from observed vertical planes and introduces them as optimizable factors within a SLAM backend, eliminating the need to handcraft concept generation, factor design, and covariance specification. We evaluate our approach in simulated environments with complex layouts, improving room detection by 20.7% and trajectory estimation by 19.2%, and further validate it on real construction sites, where room detection improves by 5.3% and map matching accuracy by 3.8%. Results confirm that learned factors can improve their handcrafted counterparts in SLAM systems and serve as a foundation for extending this approach to new spatial concepts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

Standard Large Language Modles (LLMs) are often unsuitable for this task due to context window limitations that prevent them from processing entire code repositories. As a result, various retrieval methods are commonly used, including keyword matching, text similarity, and simple graph-based heuristics such as Breadth-First Search. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a promising alternative due to their ability to model complex, repository-wide dependencies; however, their application has been hindered by the lack of a dedicated benchmark. To address this gap, we introduce GREPO, the first GNN benchmark for repository-scale bug localization tasks. GREPO comprises 86 Python repositories and 47294 bug-fixing tasks, providing graph-based data structures ready for direct GNN processing. Our evaluation of various GNN architectures shows outstanding performance compared to established information retrieval baselines.

This approach limits the scalability and generalizability of GNNs, as models must be tailored for each specific graph type. To address these challenges, we introduce GraphFM, a scalable multi-graph pretraining approach designed for learning across diverse graph datasets. GraphFM uses a Perceiver-based encoder with learned latent tokens to compress domain-specific features into a shared latent space, enabling generalization across graph domains. We propose new techniques for scaling up graph training on datasets of different sizes, allowing us to train GraphFM on 152 distinct graph datasets, containing a total of 7.4 million nodes and 189 million edges. This allows us to study the effect of scale on pretraining across domains such as molecules, citation networks, and product graphs, and show that training on diverse datasets improves performance over single-source pretraining. Additionally, pretraining with a mixture of synthetic and real graphs enhances adaptability and stability, leading to competitive performance with state-of-the-art models across various node classification tasks. This approach reduces the burden of dataset-specific training and provides a single generalist model capable of performing across multiple diverse graph structures and tasks.

However, NAS-based methods are identified to be prone to over-smoothing-the loss of node distinguishability with increased iterations-thereby limiting their effectiveness. This paper identifies two characteristics in a network, i.e., the distributions of nodes and node degrees that are critical for expressive representation but have been overlooked in existing methods. We show that these overlooked characteristics contribute significantly to over-smoothing of NAS-methods. To address this, we propose a novel weighted distribution-aware kernel that embeds nodes while taking their distributional characteristics into consideration. Our method has three distinguishing features: (1) it is the first method to explicitly incorporate both distributional characteristics; (2) it requires no optimization; and (3) it effectively mitigates the adverse effects of over-smoothing, allowing WL to preserve node distinguishability and expressiveness even after many iterations of embedding. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior community detection performance via spectral clustering, outperforming existing graph embedding methods, including deep learning methods, on standard benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Approximate Uniform Facility Location via Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13155v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a growing interest in using neural networks, especially message-passing neural networks (MPNNs), to solve hard combinatorial optimization problems heuristically. However, existing learning-based approaches for hard combinatorial optimization tasks often rely on supervised training data, reinforcement learning, or gradient estimators, leading to significant computational overhead, unstable training, or a lack of provable performance guarantees. In contrast, classical approximation algorithms offer such performance guarantees under worst-case inputs but are non-differentiable and unable to adaptively exploit structural regularities in natural input distributions. We address this dichotomy with the fundamental example of Uniform Facility Location (UniFL), a variant of the combinatorial facility location problem with applications in clustering, data summarization, logistics, and supply chain design. We develop a fully differentiable MPNN model that embeds approximation-algorithmic principles while avoiding the need for solver supervision or discrete relaxations. Our approach admits provable approximation and size generalization guarantees to much larger instances than seen during training. Empirically, we show that our approach outperforms standard non-learned approximation algorithms in terms of solution quality, closing the gap with computationally intensive integer linear programming approaches. Overall, this work provides a step toward bridging learning-based methods and approximation algorithms for discrete optimization.</p></details> |  |

We show that a missing principle is making GNN-MD IO-aware, carefully accounting for reads and writes between GPU high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. We present FlashSchNet, an efficient and accurate IO-aware SchNet-style GNN-MD framework built on four techniques: (1) flash radial basis, which fuses pairwise distance computation, Gaussian basis expansion, and cosine envelope into a single tiled pass, computing each distance once and reusing it across all basis functions; (2) flash message passing, which fuses cutoff, neighbor gather, filter multiplication, and reduction to avoid materializing edge tensors in HBM; (3) flash aggregation, which reformulates scatter-add via CSR segment reduce, reducing atomic writes by a factor of feature dimension and enabling contention-free accumulation in both forward and backward passes; (4) channel-wise 16-bit quantization that exploits the low per-channel dynamic range in SchNet MLP weights to further improve throughput with negligible accuracy loss. On a single NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000, FlashSchNet achieves 1000 ns/day aggregate simulation throughput over 64 parallel replicas on coarse-grained (CG) protein containing 269 beads (6.5x faster than CGSchNet baseline with 80% reduction of peak memory), surpassing classical force fields (e.g. MARTINI) while retaining SchNet-level accuracy and transferability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is at https://github.com/UNITES-Lab/flash-molecular-dynamics</p></details> |
| **[Which Algorithms Can Graph Neural Networks Learn?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13106v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding neural architectures' ability to learn to execute discrete algorithms, a line of work often referred to as neural algorithmic reasoning. The goal is to integrate algorithmic reasoning capabilities into larger neural pipelines. Many such architectures are based on (message-passing) graph neural networks (MPNNs), owing to their permutation equivariance and ability to deal with sparsity and variable-sized inputs. However, existing work is either largely empirical and lacks formal guarantees or it focuses solely on expressivity, leaving open the question of when and how such architectures generalize beyond a finite training set. In this work, we propose a general theoretical framework that characterizes the sufficient conditions under which MPNNs can learn an algorithm from a training set of small instances and provably approximate its behavior on inputs of arbitrary size. Our framework applies to a broad class of algorithms, including single-source shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and general dynamic programming problems, such as the $0$-$1$ knapsack problem. In addition, we establish impossibility results for a wide range of algorithmic tasks, showing that standard MPNNs cannot learn them, and we derive more expressive MPNN-like architectures that overcome these limitations. Finally, we refine our analysis for the Bellman-Ford algorithm, yielding a substantially smaller required training set and significantly extending the recent work of Nerem et al. [2025] by allowing for a differentiable regularization loss. Empirical results largely support our theoretical findings.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Vicinal Risk Minimization (VRM) have shown promise in mitigating class imbalance with numeric interpolation; however, existing approaches largely rely on embedding-space arithmetic, which fails to capture the rich semantics inherent in text-attributed graphs. In this work, we propose our method, SaVe-TAG (Semantic-aware Vicinal Risk Minimization for Long-Tailed Text-Attributed Graphs), a novel VRM framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform text-level interpolation, generating on-manifold, boundary-enriching synthetic samples for minority classes. To mitigate the risk of noisy generation, we introduce a confidence-based edge assignment mechanism that uses graph topology as a natural filter to ensure structural consistency. We provide theoretical justification for our method and conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, showing that our approach consistently outperforms both numeric interpolation and prior long-tailed node classification baselines. Our results highlight the importance of integrating semantic and structural signals for balanced and effective learning on text-attributed graphs.

| **[Coden: Efficient Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Continuous Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12613v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) are pivotal in processing dynamic graphs. However, existing TGNNs primarily target one-time predictions for a given temporal span, whereas many practical applications require continuous predictions, that predictions are issued frequently over time. Directly adapting existing TGNNs to continuous-prediction scenarios introduces either significant computational overhead or prediction quality issues especially for large graphs. This paper revisits the challenge of { continuous predictions} in TGNNs, and introduces {\sc Coden}, a TGNN model designed for efficient and effective learning on dynamic graphs. {\sc Coden} innovatively overcomes the key complexity bottleneck in existing TGNNs while preserving comparable predictive accuracy. Moreover, we further provide theoretical analyses that substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of {\sc Coden}, and clarify its duality relationship with both RNN-based and attention-based models. Our evaluations across five dynamic datasets show that {\sc Coden} surpasses existing performance benchmarks in both efficiency and effectiveness, establishing it as a superior solution for continuous prediction in evolving graph environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal driven Attention Graph Neural Network with Block Adjacency matrix (STAG-NN-BA) for Remote Land-use Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14322v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Land-use monitoring is fundamental for spatial planning, particularly in view of compound impacts of growing global populations and climate change. Despite existing applications of deep learning in land use monitoring, standard convolutional kernels in deep neural networks limit the applications of these networks to the Euclidean domain only. Considering the geodesic nature of the measurement of the earth's surface, remote sensing is one such area that can benefit from non-Euclidean and spherical domains. For this purpose, we designed a novel Graph Neural Network architecture for spatial and spatio-temporal classification using satellite imagery to acquire insights into socio-economic indicators. We propose a hybrid attention method to learn the relative importance of irregular neighbors in remote sensing data. Instead of classifying each pixel, we propose a method based on Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) image segmentation and Graph Attention Network. The superpixels obtained from SLIC become the nodes of our Graph Convolution Network (GCN). A region adjacency graph (RAG) is then constructed where each superpixel is connected to every other adjacent superpixel in the image, enabling information to propagate globally. Finally, we propose a Spatially driven Attention Graph Neural Network (SAG-NN) to classify each RAG. We also propose an extension to our SAG-NN for spatio-temporal data. Unlike regular grids of pixels in images, superpixels are irregular in nature and cannot be used to create spatio-temporal graphs. We introduce temporal bias by combining unconnected RAGs from each image into one supergraph. This is achieved by introducing block adjacency matrices resulting in novel Spatio-Temporal driven Attention Graph Neural Network with Block Adjacency matrix (STAG-NN-BA). SAG-NN and STAG-NN-BA outperform graph and non-graph baselines on Asia14 and C2D2 datasets efficiently.</p></details> |  |
| **[RLMiner: Finding the Most Frequent k-sized Subgraph via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12416v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying the most frequent induced subgraph of size $k$ in a target graph is a fundamental graph mining problem with direct implications for Web-related data mining and social network analysis. Despite its importance, finding the most frequent induced subgraph remains computationally expensive due to the NP-hard nature of the subgraph counting task. Traditional exact enumeration algorithms often suffer from high time complexity, especially for a large graph size $k$. To mitigate this, existing approaches often utilize frequency measurement with the Downward Closure Property to reduce the search space, imposing additional constraints on the task. In this paper, we first formulate this task as a Markov Decision Process and approach it using a multi-task reinforcement learning framework. Specifically, we introduce RLMiner, a novel framework that integrates reinforcement learning with our proposed task-state-aware Graph Neural Network to find the most frequent induced subgraph of size $k$ with a time complexity linear to $k$. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed RLMiner effectively identifies subgraphs with frequencies closely matching the ground-truth most frequent induced subgraphs, while achieving significantly shorter and more stable running times compared to traditional methods.</p></details> |  |

We show that these wavelets may be effectively incorporated into a family of geometric graph neural networks, which we refer to as VDW-GNNs. We demonstrate that such networks are effective on synthetic point cloud data, as well as on real-world data derived from wind-field measurements and neural activity data. Theoretically, we prove that these new wavelets have desirable frame theoretic properties, similar to traditional diffusion wavelets. Additionally, we prove that these wavelets have desirable symmetries with respect to rotations and translations.</p></details> | <details><summary>A pre...</summary><p>A previous, shorter version of this work was presented in the workshop "New Perspectives in Advancing Graph Machine Learning" at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[ATLAS: Adaptive Topology-based Learning at Scale for Homophilic and Heterophilic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14908v5)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel on homophilic graphs where connected nodes share labels, but struggle with heterophilic graphs where edges do not imply similarity. Moreover, iterative message passing limits scalability due to neighborhood expansion overhead. We introduce ATLAS (Adaptive Topology-based Learning at Scale), a propagation-free framework that encodes graph structure through multi-resolution community features rather than message passing. We first prove that community refinement involves a fundamental trade-off: finer partitions increase label-community mutual information but also increase entropy. We formalize when refinement improves normalized mutual information, explaining why intermediate granularities are often most predictive. ATLAS employs modularity-guided adaptive search to automatically identify informative community scales, which are one-hot encoded, projected into learnable embeddings, and concatenated with node attributes for MLP classification. This enables standard mini-batch training and adjacency-free inference after one-time preprocessing. Across 13 benchmarks including million-node graphs, ATLAS achieves competitive or superior accuracy, up to 20-point gains over GCN on heterophilic datasets and 12-point gains over MLPs on homophilic graphs. By treating topology as explicit features, ATLAS adapts intelligently: leveraging structure when informative, remaining robust when weakly aligned, and avoiding propagation when structure misleads, providing both scalable performance and interpretable structural insights.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Bayesian Neighborhood Adaptation for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05358v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The neighborhood scope (i.e., number of hops) where graph neural networks (GNNs) aggregate information to characterize a node's statistical property is critical to GNNs' performance. Two-stage approaches, training and validating GNNs for every pre-specified neighborhood scope to search for the best setting, is a time-consuming task and tends to be biased due to the search space design. How to adaptively determine proper neighborhood scopes for the aggregation process for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs remains largely unexplored. We thus propose to model the GNNs' message-passing behavior on a graph as a stochastic process by treating the number of hops as a beta process. This Bayesian framework allows us to infer the most plausible neighborhood scope for message aggregation simultaneously with the optimization of GNN parameters. Our theoretical analysis shows that the scope inference improves the expressivity of a GNN. Experiments on benchmark homophilic and heterophilic datasets show that the proposed method is compatible with state-of-the-art GNN variants, achieving competitive or superior performance on the node classification task, and providing well-calibrated predictions.

| **[Community Concealment from Unsupervised Graph Learning-Based Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12250v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to use attributed graphs to learn representations. Such representations are beneficial in the unsupervised learning of clusters and community detection. Nonetheless, such inference may reveal sensitive groups, clustered systems, or collective behaviors, raising concerns regarding group-level privacy. Community attribution in social and critical infrastructure networks, for example, can expose coordinated asset groups, operational hierarchies, and system dependencies that could be used for profiling or intelligence gathering. We study a defensive setting in which a data publisher (defender) seeks to conceal a community of interest while making limited, utility-aware changes in the network. Our analysis indicates that community concealment is strongly influenced by two quantifiable factors: connectivity at the community boundary and feature similarity between the protected community and adjacent communities. Informed by these findings, we present a perturbation strategy that rewires a set of selected edges and modifies node features to reduce the distinctiveness leveraged by GNN message passing. The proposed method outperforms DICE in our experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real network graphs under identical perturbation budgets. Overall, it achieves median relative concealment improvements of approximately 20-45% across the evaluated settings. These findings demonstrate a mitigation strategy against GNN-based community learning and highlight group-level privacy risks intrinsic to graph learning.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces RokomariBG, a large-scale, multi-entity heterogeneous book graph dataset designed to support research on personalized recommendation in a low-resource language setting. The dataset comprises 127,302 books, 63,723 users, 16,601 authors, 1,515 categories, 2,757 publishers, and 209,602 reviews, connected through eight relation types and organized as a comprehensive knowledge graph. To demonstrate the utility of the dataset, we provide a systematic benchmarking study on the Top-N recommendation task, evaluating a diverse set of representative recommendation models, including classical collaborative filtering methods, matrix factorization models, content-based approaches, graph neural networks, a hybrid matrix factorization model with side information, and a neural two-tower retrieval architecture. The benchmarking results highlight the importance of leveraging multi-relational structure and textual side information, with neural retrieval models achieving the strongest performance (NDCG@10 = 0.204). Overall, this work establishes a foundational benchmark and a publicly available resource for Bangla book recommendation research, enabling reproducible evaluation and future studies on recommendation in low-resource cultural domains.

| **[Self-Adaptive Graph Mixture of Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13062v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning over graph-structured data, yet recent studies have shown that their performance gains are beginning to plateau. In many cases, well-established models such as GCN and GAT, when appropriately tuned, can match or even exceed the performance of more complex, state-of-the-art architectures. This trend highlights a key limitation in the current landscape: the difficulty of selecting the most suitable model for a given graph task or dataset. To address this, we propose Self-Adaptive Graph Mixture of Models (SAGMM), a modular and practical framework that learns to automatically select and combine the most appropriate GNN models from a diverse pool of architectures. Unlike prior mixture-of-experts approaches that rely on variations of a single base model, SAGMM leverages architectural diversity and a topology-aware attention gating mechanism to adaptively assign experts to each node based on the structure of the input graph. To improve efficiency, SAGMM includes a pruning mechanism that reduces the number of active experts during training and inference without compromising performance. We also explore a training-efficient variant in which expert models are pretrained and frozen, and only the gating and task-specific layers are trained. We evaluate SAGMM on 16 benchmark datasets covering node classification, graph classification, regression, and link prediction tasks, and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms or matches leading GNN baselines and prior mixture-based methods, offering a robust and adaptive solution for real-world graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[GP2F: Cross-Domain Graph Prompting with Adaptive Fusion of Pre-trained Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11629v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for downstream adaptation of pre-trained graph models, mitigating the misalignment between pre-training objectives and downstream tasks. Recently, the focus of GPL has shifted from in-domain to cross-domain scenarios, which is closer to the real world applications, where the pre-training source and downstream target often differ substantially in data distribution. However, why GPLs remain effective under such domain shifts is still unexplored. Empirically, we observe that representative GPL methods are competitive with two simple baselines in cross-domain settings: full fine-tuning (FT) and linear probing (LP), motivating us to explore a deeper understanding of the prompting mechanism. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that jointly leveraging these two complementary branches yields a smaller estimation error than using either branch alone, formally proving that cross-domain GPL benefits from the integration between pre-trained knowledge and task-specific adaptation. Based on this insight, we propose GP2F, a dual-branch GPL method that explicitly instantiates the two extremes: (1) a frozen branch that retains pre-trained knowledge, and (2) an adapted branch with lightweight adapters for task-specific adaptation. We then perform adaptive fusion under topology constraints via a contrastive loss and a topology-consistent loss. Extensive experiments on cross-domain few-shot node and graph classification demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |
