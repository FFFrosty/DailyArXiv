| **[TESSERA: Temporal Embeddings of Surface Spectra for Earth Representation and Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20380v2)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satellite remote sensing from repeated observations and multiple sensors enables a wide range of downstream applications, including climate modeling, carbon accounting, and strategies for conservation and sustainable land use. However, satellite time series are voluminous, often corrupted by sensor noise, clouds, and atmospheric conditions, and unevenly spaced in time, making them challenging to use. We present TESSERA, an open, global, land-oriented remote sensing foundation model that uses self-supervised learning to generate `ready-to-use' embeddings at 10~m scale from pixel-level satellite time series data. TESSERA uses two parallel Transformer-based encoders to combine optical data from ten Sentinel-2 spectral bands at 10-60~m spatial resolution and two Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar backscatter coefficients at 10~m resolution to create embeddings that are subsequently fused with a multilayer perceptron to create annual global embedding maps. We compare our work with state-of-the-art task-specific models and other foundation models in five diverse downstream tasks and find that TESSERA closely matches or outperforms these baselines. We believe that TESSERA's ease of use, openness, computation-, label-, and data-efficiency, and high performance will prove transformative in a wide range of vegetation-oriented ecological and agricultural applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modality Agnostic Efficient Long Range Encoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19409v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The long-context capability of recent large transformer models can be surmised to rely on techniques such as attention/model parallelism, as well as hardware-level optimizations. While these strategies allow input lengths to scale to millions of tokens, they do not fundamentally mitigate the quadratic computational and memory complexity of the core attention mechanism. In this paper, we address the challenge of long-context processing on a single device using generic implementations by reducing the quadratic memory footprint and inference cost. Existing approaches to extend the context length for generic single device implementations -- such as token merging and modified attentions -- are often modality specific and attain a suboptimal tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose MAELRE (Modality Agnostic Efficient Long Range Encoder), a unified and efficient transformer architecture designed for long-range encoding across diverse modalities. MAELRE integrates token merging with attention approximation, progressively merging tokens at different stages of internal computational blocks. It employs a lightweight attention approximation when the number of tokens is large, and switches to standard dot-product attention as the sequence becomes shorter through successive aggregation. We demonstrate that MAELRE achieves superior accuracy while reducing computational cost compared to existing long-context models on classification tasks spanning multiple modalities, including text, time series, audio, and vision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Recurrent Ensembles for Predicting Brain Responses to Naturalistic Movies (Algonauts 2025)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17897v2)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting distributed cortical responses to naturalistic stimuli requires models that integrate visual, auditory and semantic information over time. We present a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series recorded while four subjects watched almost 80 hours of movies provided by the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Modality-specific bidirectional RNNs encode temporal dynamics; their hidden states are fused and passed to a second recurrent layer, and lightweight subject-specific heads output responses for 1000 cortical parcels. Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions. Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r = 0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject (Subject 5). The approach establishes a simple, extensible baseline for future multimodal brain-encoding benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, 1 table.

| **[Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing with Visibility Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19046v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of complex and nonlinear time series remains a challenging problem across engineering and scientific disciplines. Reservoir computing (RC) offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional deep learning by training only the read-out layer while employing a randomly structured and fixed reservoir network. Despite its advantages, the largely random reservoir graph architecture often results in suboptimal and oversized networks with poorly understood dynamics. Addressing this issue, we propose a novel Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing (DyRC) framework that systematically infers the reservoir network structure directly from the input training sequence. This work proposes to employ the visibility graph (VG) technique, which converts time series data into networks by representing measurement points as nodes linked by mutual visibility. The reservoir network is constructed by directly adopting the VG network from a training data sequence, leveraging the parameter-free visibility graph approach to avoid expensive hyperparameter tuning. This process results in a reservoir that is directly informed by the specific dynamics of the prediction task under study. We assess the DyRC-VG method through prediction tasks involving the canonical nonlinear Duffing oscillator, evaluating prediction accuracy and consistency. Compared to an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph of the same size, spectral radius, and comparable density, we observe higher prediction quality and more consistent performance over repeated implementations in the DyRC-VG.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures.

| **[A diffusion-based generative model for financial time series via geometric Brownian motion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19003v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel diffusion-based generative framework for financial time series that incorporates geometric Brownian motion (GBM), the foundation of the Black--Scholes theory, into the forward noising process. Unlike standard score-based models that treat price trajectories as generic numerical sequences, our method injects noise proportionally to asset prices at each time step, reflecting the heteroskedasticity observed in financial time series. By accurately balancing the drift and diffusion terms, we show that the resulting log-price process reduces to a variance-exploding stochastic differential equation, aligning with the formulation in score-based generative models. The reverse-time generative process is trained via denoising score matching using a Transformer-based architecture adapted from the Conditional Score-based Diffusion Imputation (CSDI) framework. Empirical evaluations on historical stock data demonstrate that our model reproduces key stylized facts heavy-tailed return distributions, volatility clustering, and the leverage effect more realistically than conventional diffusion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hysteretic Multivariate Bayesian Structural GARCH Model with Soft Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18990v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces the SH-MBS-GARCH model, a hysteretic multivariate Bayesian structural GARCH framework that integrates hard and soft information to capture the joint dynamics of multiple financial time series, incorporating hysteretic effects and addressing conditional heteroscedasticity through GARCH components. Various model specifications could utilize soft information to define the regime indicator in distinct ways. We propose a flexible, straightforward method for embedding soft information into the regime component, applicable across all SH-MBS-GARCH model variants. We further propose a generally applicable Bayesian estimation approach that combines adaptive MCMC, spike-and-slab regression, and a simulation smoother, ensuring accurate parameter estimation, validated through extensive simulations. Empirical analysis of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, NASDAQ Composite, and PHLX Semiconductor indices from January 2016 to December 2020 demonstrates that the SH-MBS-GARCH model outperforms competing models in fitting and prediction accuracy, effectively capturing regime-switching dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages and 8 figures</p></details> |
| **[KASPER: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks for Stock Prediction and Explainable Regimes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18983v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting in financial markets remains a significant challenge due to their nonlinear and regime-dependent dynamics. Traditional deep learning models, such as long short-term memory networks and multilayer perceptrons, often struggle to generalize across shifting market conditions, highlighting the need for a more adaptive and interpretable approach. To address this, we introduce Kolmogorov-Arnold networks for stock prediction and explainable regimes (KASPER), a novel framework that integrates regime detection, sparse spline-based function modeling, and symbolic rule extraction. The framework identifies hidden market conditions using a Gumbel-Softmax-based mechanism, enabling regime-specific forecasting. For each regime, it employs Kolmogorov-Arnold networks with sparse spline activations to capture intricate price behaviors while maintaining robustness. Interpretability is achieved through symbolic learning based on Monte Carlo Shapley values, which extracts human-readable rules tailored to each regime. Applied to real-world financial time series from Yahoo Finance, the model achieves an $R^2$ score of 0.89, a Sharpe Ratio of 12.02, and a mean squared error as low as 0.0001, outperforming existing methods. This research establishes a new direction for regime-aware, transparent, and robust forecasting in financial markets.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[TiVy: Time Series Visual Summary for Scalable Visualization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18972v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visualizing multiple time series presents fundamental tradeoffs between scalability and visual clarity. Time series capture the behavior of many large-scale real-world processes, from stock market trends to urban activities. Users often gain insights by visualizing them as line charts, juxtaposing or superposing multiple time series to compare them and identify trends and patterns. However, existing representations struggle with scalability: when covering long time spans, leading to visual clutter from too many small multiples or overlapping lines. We propose TiVy, a new algorithm that summarizes time series using sequential patterns. It transforms the series into a set of symbolic sequences based on subsequence visual similarity using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), then constructs a disjoint grouping of similar subsequences based on the frequent sequential patterns. The grouping result, a visual summary of time series, provides uncluttered superposition with fewer small multiples. Unlike common clustering techniques, TiVy extracts similar subsequences (of varying lengths) aligned in time. We also present an interactive time series visualization that renders large-scale time series in real-time. Our experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm (1) extracts clear and accurate patterns when visualizing time series data, (2) achieves a significant speed-up (1000X) compared to a straightforward DTW clustering. We also demonstrate the efficiency of our approach to explore hidden structures in massive time series data in two usage scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in TVCG (IEEE VIS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Functional Periodic ARMA Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18962v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Periodicity is a common feature in functional time series analysis. While autoregressive models in Hilbert spaces have been extended to incorporate it, existing approaches often remain loosely specified or fail to capture inter-seasonal dependencies. This paper introduces periodic autoregressive moving average (fpARMA) processes in general separable Hilbert spaces that fully model inter-seasonal structure. We establish conditions for periodic stationarity, finite moments, and weak dependence, and propose consistent Yule-Walker-type estimators with convergence rates under Sobolev-type regularity. Examples demonstrate applicability and model assumptions.</p></details> | 24 pages |
| **[A Survey on State-of-the-art Deep Learning Applications and Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17561v9)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, is a data-driven method that uses multiple layers of interconnected units or neurons to learn intricate patterns and representations directly from raw input data. Empowered by this learning capability, it has become a powerful tool for solving complex problems and is the core driver of many groundbreaking technologies and innovations. Building a deep learning model is challenging due to the algorithm's complexity and the dynamic nature of real-world problems. Several studies have reviewed deep learning concepts and applications. However, the studies mostly focused on the types of deep learning models and convolutional neural network architectures, offering limited coverage of the state-of-the-art deep learning models and their applications in solving complex problems across different domains. Therefore, motivated by the limitations, this study aims to comprehensively review the state-of-the-art deep learning models in computer vision, natural language processing, time series analysis and pervasive computing, and robotics. We highlight the key features of the models and their effectiveness in solving the problems within each domain. Furthermore, this study presents the fundamentals of deep learning, various deep learning model types and prominent convolutional neural network architectures. Finally, challenges and future directions in deep learning research are discussed to offer a broader perspective for future researchers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update journal reference.

| **[VISTA-SSM: Varying and Irregular Sampling Time-series Analysis via State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21527v3)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce VISTA, a clustering approach for multivariate and irregularly sampled time series based on a parametric state space mixture model. VISTA is specifically designed for the unsupervised identification of groups in datasets originating from healthcare and psychology where such sampling issues are commonplace. Our approach adapts linear Gaussian state space models (LGSSMs) to provide a flexible parametric framework for fitting a wide range of time series dynamics. The clustering approach itself is based on the assumption that the population can be represented as a mixture of a fixed number of LGSSMs. VISTA's model formulation allows for an explicit derivation of the log-likelihood function, from which we develop an expectation-maximization scheme for fitting model parameters to the observed data samples. Our algorithmic implementation is designed to handle populations of multivariate time series that can exhibit large changes in sampling rate as well as irregular sampling. We evaluate the versatility and accuracy of our approach on simulated and real-world datasets, including demographic trends, wearable sensor data, epidemiological time series, and ecological momentary assessments. Our results indicate that VISTA outperforms most comparable standard times series clustering methods. We provide an open-source implementation of VISTA in Python.</p></details> |  |
| **[State of Health Estimation of Batteries Using a Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence-Inverted Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18320v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of battery-powered vehicles and energy storage systems over the past decade has made battery health monitoring increasingly critical. Batteries play a central role in the efficiency and safety of these systems, yet they inevitably degrade over time due to repeated charge-discharge cycles. This degradation leads to reduced energy efficiency and potential overheating, posing significant safety concerns. Accurate estimation of a State of Health (SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability and safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs, transformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from discharge cycle data. However, these models struggle with the irregularities inherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at non-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly. To address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences rather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and compromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel architecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT). TIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent irregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention mechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence information. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show that TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50% reduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below 0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for broader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series data.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Local Polynomial Estimation of Time-Varying Parameters in Nonlinear Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05209v3)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a novel asymptotic theory for local polynomial extremum estimators of time-varying parameters in a broad class of nonlinear time series models. We show the proposed estimators are consistent and follow normal distributions in large samples under weak conditions. We also provide a precise characterisation of the leading bias term due to smoothing, which has not been done before. We demonstrate the usefulness of our general results by establishing primitive conditions for local (quasi-)maximum-likelihood estimators of time-varying models threshold autoregressions, ARCH models and Poisson autogressions with exogenous co--variates, to be normally distributed in large samples and characterise their leading biases. An empirical study of US corporate default counts demonstrates the applicability of the proposed local linear estimator for Poisson autoregression, shedding new light on the dynamic properties of US corporate defaults.</p></details> |  |
| **[DisMS-TS: Eliminating Redundant Multi-Scale Features for Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04600v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world time series typically exhibit complex temporal variations, making the time series classification task notably challenging. Recent advancements have demonstrated the potential of multi-scale analysis approaches, which provide an effective solution for capturing these complex temporal patterns. However, existing multi-scale analysis-based time series prediction methods fail to eliminate redundant scale-shared features across multi-scale time series, resulting in the model over- or under-focusing on scale-shared features. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end Disentangled Multi-Scale framework for Time Series classification (DisMS-TS). The core idea of DisMS-TS is to eliminate redundant shared features in multi-scale time series, thereby improving prediction performance. Specifically, we propose a temporal disentanglement module to capture scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, respectively. Subsequently, to effectively learn both scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, we introduce two regularization terms that ensure the consistency of scale-shared representations and the disparity of scale-specific representations across all temporal scales. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets validate the superiority of DisMS-TS over its competitive baselines, with the accuracy improvement up to 9.71%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for presentation at the ACM International Conference on Multimedia (ACM MM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Why Do Class-Dependent Evaluation Effects Occur with Time Series Feature Attributions? A Synthetic Data Investigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11790v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating feature attribution methods represents a critical challenge in explainable AI (XAI), as researchers typically rely on perturbation-based metrics when ground truth is unavailable. However, recent work reveals that these evaluation metrics can show different performance across predicted classes within the same dataset. These "class-dependent evaluation effects" raise questions about whether perturbation analysis reliably measures attribution quality, with direct implications for XAI method development and evaluation trustworthiness. We investigate under which conditions these class-dependent effects arise by conducting controlled experiments with synthetic time series data where ground truth feature locations are known. We systematically vary feature types and class contrasts across binary classification tasks, then compare perturbation-based degradation scores with ground truth-based precision-recall metrics using multiple attribution methods. Our experiments demonstrate that class-dependent effects emerge with both evaluation approaches, even in simple scenarios with temporally localized features, triggered by basic variations in feature amplitude or temporal extent between classes. Most critically, we find that perturbation-based and ground truth metrics frequently yield contradictory assessments of attribution quality across classes, with weak correlations between evaluation approaches. These findings suggest that researchers should interpret perturbation-based metrics with care, as they may not always align with whether attributions correctly identify discriminating features. By showing this disconnect, our work points toward reconsidering what attribution evaluation actually measures and developing more rigorous evaluation methods that capture multiple dimensions of attribution quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TempXAI Workshop @ ECML-PKDD 2025 (Explainable AI for Time Series and Data Streams)</p></details> |
| **[Cloud gap-filling with deep learning for improved grassland monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09554v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uninterrupted optical image time series are crucial for the timely monitoring of agricultural land changes, particularly in grasslands. However, the continuity of such time series is often disrupted by clouds. In response to this challenge, we propose an innovative deep learning method that integrates cloud-free optical (Sentinel-2) observations and weather-independent (Sentinel-1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. Our approach employs a hybrid architecture combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to generate continuous Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series, highlighting the role of NDVI in the synergy between SAR and optical data. We demonstrate the significance of observation continuity by assessing the impact of the generated NDVI time series on the downstream task of grassland mowing event detection. We conducted our study in Lithuania, a country characterized by extensive cloud coverage, and compared our approach with alternative interpolation techniques (i.e., linear, Akima, quadratic). Our method outperformed these techniques, achieving an average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.024 and a coefficient of determination R^2 of 0.92. Additionally, our analysis revealed improvement in the performance of the mowing event detection, with F1-score up to 84% using two widely applied mowing detection methodologies. Our method also effectively mitigated sudden shifts and noise originating from cloudy observations, which are often missed by conventional cloud masks and adversely affect mowing detection precision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Computers and Electronics in Agriculture</p></details> |
| **[SDSC:A Structure-Aware Metric for Semantic Signal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14516v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose the Signal Dice Similarity Coefficient (SDSC), a structure-aware metric function for time series self-supervised representation learning. Most Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods for signals commonly adopt distance-based objectives such as mean squared error (MSE), which are sensitive to amplitude, invariant to waveform polarity, and unbounded in scale. These properties hinder semantic alignment and reduce interpretability. SDSC addresses this by quantifying structural agreement between temporal signals based on the intersection of signed amplitudes, derived from the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).Although SDSC is defined as a structure-aware metric, it can be used as a loss by subtracting from 1 and applying a differentiable approximation of the Heaviside function for gradient-based optimization. A hybrid loss formulation is also proposed to combine SDSC with MSE, improving stability and preserving amplitude where necessary. Experiments on forecasting and classification benchmarks demonstrate that SDSC-based pre-training achieves comparable or improved performance over MSE, particularly in in-domain and low-resource scenarios. The results suggest that structural fidelity in signal representations enhances the semantic representation quality, supporting the consideration of structure-aware metrics as viable alternatives to conventional distance-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fixing the Pitfalls of Probabilistic Time-Series Forecasting Evaluation by Kernel Quadrature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06079v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the significance of probabilistic time-series forecasting models, their evaluation metrics often involve intractable integrations. The most widely used metric, the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), is a strictly proper scoring function; however, its computation requires approximation. We found that popular CRPS estimators--specifically, the quantile-based estimator implemented in the widely used GluonTS library and the probability-weighted moment approximation--both exhibit inherent estimation biases. These biases lead to crude approximations, resulting in improper rankings of forecasting model performance when CRPS values are close. To address this issue, we introduced a kernel quadrature approach that leverages an unbiased CRPS estimator and employs cubature construction for scalable computation. Empirically, our approach consistently outperforms the two widely used CRPS estimators.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Automated Brake Onset Detection in Naturalistic Driving Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17943v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Response timing measures play a crucial role in the assessment of automated driving systems (ADS) in collision avoidance scenarios, including but not limited to establishing human benchmarks and comparing ADS to human driver response performance. For example, measuring the response time (of a human driver or ADS) to a conflict requires the determination of a stimulus onset and a response onset. In existing studies, response onset relies on manual annotation or vehicle control signals such as accelerator and brake pedal movements. These methods are not applicable when analyzing large scale data where vehicle control signals are not available. This holds in particular for the rapidly expanding sets of ADS log data where the behavior of surrounding road users is observed via onboard sensors. To advance evaluation techniques for ADS and enable measuring response timing when vehicle control signals are not available, we developed a simple and efficient algorithm, based on a piecewise linear acceleration model, to automatically estimate brake onset that can be applied to any type of driving data that includes vehicle longitudinal time series data. We also proposed a manual annotation method to identify brake onset and used it as ground truth for validation. R2 was used as a confidence metric to measure the accuracy of the algorithm, and its classification performance was analyzed using naturalistic collision avoidance data of both ADS and humans, where our method was validated against human manual annotation. Although our algorithm is subject to certain limitations, it is efficient, generalizable, applicable to any road user and scenario types, and is highly configurable.</p></details> |  |

Then, we deduce the asymptotic distribution of the entropy-complexity pair, which emerged as a popular tool for summarizing the time-series dynamics. Here, we make the necessary distinction between a uniform and a non-uniform ordinal pattern distribution and, thus, obtain two different limit theorems. On this basis, we consider a test for serial dependence and check its finite-sample performance. Moreover, we use our asymptotic results to approximate the estimation uncertainty of entropy-complexity pairs.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Physically Driven Long Short Term Memory Model for Estimating Snow Water Equivalent over the Continental United States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20129v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Snow is an essential input for various land surface models. Seasonal snow estimates are available as snow water equivalent (SWE) from process-based reanalysis products or locally from in situ measurements. While the reanalysis products are computationally expensive and available at only fixed spatial and temporal resolutions, the in situ measurements are highly localized and sparse. To address these issues and enable the analysis of the effect of a large suite of physical, morphological, and geological conditions on the presence and amount of snow, we build a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which is able to estimate the SWE based on time series input of the various physical/meteorological factors as well static spatial/morphological factors. Specifically, this model breaks down the SWE estimation into two separate tasks: (i) a classification task that indicates the presence/absence of snow on a specific day and (ii) a regression task that indicates the height of the SWE on a specific day in the case of snow presence. The model is trained using physical/in situ SWE measurements from the SNOw TELemetry (SNOTEL) snow pillows in the western United States. We will show that trained LSTM models have a classification accuracy of $\geq 93\%$ for the presence of snow and a coefficient of correlation of $\sim 0.9$ concerning their SWE estimates. We will also demonstrate that the models can generalize both spatially and temporally to previously unseen data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of journal paper in preparation.

| **[CoCAI: Copula-based Conformal Anomaly Identification for Multivariate Time-Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17796v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework that harnesses the power of generative artificial intelligence and copula-based modeling to address two critical challenges in multivariate time-series analysis: delivering accurate predictions and enabling robust anomaly detection. Our method, Copula-based Conformal Anomaly Identification for Multivariate Time-Series (CoCAI), leverages a diffusion-based model to capture complex dependencies within the data, enabling high quality forecasting. The model's outputs are further calibrated using a conformal prediction technique, yielding predictive regions which are statistically valid, i.e., cover the true target values with a desired confidence level. Starting from these calibrated forecasts, robust outlier detection is performed by combining dimensionality reduction techniques with copula-based modeling, providing a statistically grounded anomaly score. CoCAI benefits from an offline calibration phase that allows for minimal overhead during deployment and delivers actionable results rooted in established theoretical foundations. Empirical tests conducted on real operational data derived from water distribution and sewerage systems confirm CoCAI's effectiveness in accurately forecasting target sequences of data and in identifying anomalous segments within them.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Presentation at Runtime Verification 25</p></details> |
| **[MIRA: Medical Time Series Foundation Model for Real-World Health Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07584v3)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A unified foundation model for medical time series -- pretrained on open access and ethics board-approved medical corpora -- offers the potential to reduce annotation burdens, minimize model customization, and enable robust transfer across clinical institutions, modalities, and tasks, particularly in data-scarce or privacy-constrained environments. However, existing generalist time series foundation models struggle to handle medical time series data due to their inherent challenges, including irregular intervals, heterogeneous sampling rates, and frequent missing values. To address these challenges, we introduce MIRA, a unified foundation model specifically designed for medical time series forecasting. MIRA incorporates a Continuous-Time Rotary Positional Encoding that enables fine-grained modeling of variable time intervals, a frequency-specific mixture-of-experts layer that routes computation across latent frequency regimes to further promote temporal specialization, and a Continuous Dynamics Extrapolation Block based on Neural ODE that models the continuous trajectory of latent states, enabling accurate forecasting at arbitrary target timestamps. Pretrained on a large-scale and diverse medical corpus comprising over 454 billion time points collect from publicly available datasets, MIRA achieves reductions in forecasting errors by an average of 10% and 7% in out-of-distribution and in-distribution scenarios, respectively, when compared to other zero-shot and fine-tuned baselines. We also introduce a comprehensive benchmark spanning multiple downstream clinical tasks, establishing a foundation for future research in medical time series modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mapping of Weed Management Methods in Orchards using Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19991v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective weed management is crucial for improving agricultural productivity, as weeds compete with crops for vital resources like nutrients and water. Accurate maps of weed management methods are essential for policymakers to assess farmer practices, evaluate impacts on vegetation health, biodiversity, and climate, as well as ensure compliance with policies and subsidies. However, monitoring weed management methods is challenging as they commonly rely on ground-based field surveys, which are often costly, time-consuming and subject to delays. In order to tackle this problem, we leverage earth observation data and Machine Learning (ML). Specifically, we developed separate ML models using Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope satellite time series data, respectively, to classify four distinct weed management methods (Mowing, Tillage, Chemical-spraying, and No practice) in orchards. The findings demonstrate the potential of ML-driven remote sensing to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of weed management mapping in orchards.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for 2025 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[C3RL: Rethinking the Combination of Channel-independence and Channel-mixing from Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17454v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting has drawn increasing attention due to its practical importance. Existing approaches typically adopt either channel-mixing (CM) or channel-independence (CI) strategies. CM strategy can capture inter-variable dependencies but fails to discern variable-specific temporal patterns. CI strategy improves this aspect but fails to fully exploit cross-variable dependencies like CM. Hybrid strategies based on feature fusion offer limited generalization and interpretability. To address these issues, we propose C3RL, a novel representation learning framework that jointly models both CM and CI strategies. Motivated by contrastive learning in computer vision, C3RL treats the inputs of the two strategies as transposed views and builds a siamese network architecture: one strategy serves as the backbone, while the other complements it. By jointly optimizing contrastive and prediction losses with adaptive weighting, C3RL balances representation and forecasting performance. Extensive experiments on seven models show that C3RL boosts the best-case performance rate to 81.4\% for models based on CI strategy and to 76.3\% for models based on CM strategy, demonstrating strong generalization and effectiveness. The code will be available once the paper is accepted.</p></details> |  |

This study evaluates optical Sentinel-2 satellite imagery for detecting digestate application, a practice that enhances soil fertility but poses environmental risks like microplastic contamination and nitrogen losses. In the first instance, Sentinel-2 satellite image time series (SITS) analysis of specific indices (EOMI, NDVI, EVI) was used to characterize EOM's spectral behavior after application on the soils of four different crop types in Thessaly, Greece. Furthermore, Machine Learning (ML) models (namely Random Forest, k-NN, Gradient Boosting and a Feed-Forward Neural Network), were used to investigate digestate presence detection, achieving F1-scores up to 0.85. The findings highlight the potential of combining remote sensing and ML for scalable and cost-effective monitoring of EOM applications, supporting precision agriculture and sustainability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for 2025 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS 2025)</p></details> |

However, its core component, self-attention, has the quadratic time complexity relative to input sequence length, which hinders the scalability of Transformers. The exsiting approaches on optimizing self-attention either discard full-contextual information or lack of flexibility. In this work, we design DistrAttention, an effcient and flexible self-attention mechanism with the full context. DistrAttention achieves this by grouping data on the embedding dimensionality, usually referred to as $d$. We realize DistrAttention with a lightweight sampling and fusion method that exploits locality-sensitive hashing to group similar data. A block-wise grouping framework is further designed to limit the errors introduced by locality sensitive hashing. By optimizing the selection of block sizes, DistrAttention could be easily integrated with FlashAttention-2, gaining high-performance on modern GPUs. We evaluate DistrAttention with extensive experiments. The results show that our method is 37% faster than FlashAttention-2 on calculating self-attention. In ViT inference, DistrAttention is the fastest and the most accurate among approximate self-attention mechanisms. In Llama3-1B, DistrAttention still achieves the lowest inference time with only 1% accuray loss.</p></details> |  |
| **[Eco-Friendly AI: Unleashing Data Power for Green Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17241v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) comes with a significant environmental impact, particularly in terms of energy consumption and carbon emissions. This pressing issue highlights the need for innovative solutions to mitigate AI's ecological footprint. One of the key factors influencing the energy consumption of ML model training is the size of the training dataset. ML models are often trained on vast amounts of data continuously generated by sensors and devices distributed across multiple locations. To reduce data transmission costs and enhance privacy, Federated Learning (FL) enables model training without the need to move or share raw data. While FL offers these advantages, it also introduces challenges due to the heterogeneity of data sources (related to volume and quality), computational node capabilities, and environmental impact. This paper contributes to the advancement of Green AI by proposing a data-centric approach to Green Federated Learning. Specifically, we focus on reducing FL's environmental impact by minimizing the volume of training data. Our methodology involves the analysis of the characteristics of federated datasets, the selecting of an optimal subset of data based on quality metrics, and the choice of the federated nodes with the lowest environmental impact. We develop a comprehensive methodology that examines the influence of data-centric factors, such as data quality and volume, on FL training performance and carbon emissions. Building on these insights, we introduce an interactive recommendation system that optimizes FL configurations through data reduction, minimizing environmental impact during training. Applying this methodology to time series classification has demonstrated promising results in reducing the environmental impact of FL tasks.</p></details> |  |

In the context of globalization and economic interdependencies, corruption not only affects investment and distorts markets, but it can also, under certain conditions, temporarily boost economic activity. Using data from the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the Corruption Perception Index (CPI), we implement a time-series-based model to capture the interactions between these two variables. Through a coupled vector autoregressive equations system, our model identifies patterns of interdependence between economic fluctuations and perceptions of corruption at a global level. Employing graph theory and Granger causality, we build a network of interconnections that illustrates how corruption dynamics in one country can influence economic growth and corruption perception in others. The results provide a robust tool for analyzing international political-economic relationships and can serve as a basis for designing policies that promote transparency and sustainable development.</p></details> | <details><summary>We de...</summary><p>We decided to withdraw the current version of the manuscript to improve its structure, clarify some arguments, and incorporate additional results.

However, this is often not the case for high-dimensional data, and it can be hard even for domain experts to mathematically specify which features are important. Can we instead automatically extract collections or groups of features that are aligned with expert knowledge? To address this gap, we present FIX (Features Interpretable to eXperts), a benchmark for measuring how well a collection of features aligns with expert knowledge. In collaboration with domain experts, we propose FIXScore, a unified expert alignment measure applicable to diverse real-world settings across cosmology, psychology, and medicine domains in vision, language, and time series data modalities. With FIXScore, we find that popular feature-based explanation methods have poor alignment with expert-specified knowledge, highlighting the need for new methods that can better identify features interpretable to experts.</p></details> |  |

This study presents a new frame of LLMs named CGF-LLM using GPT-2 combined with fuzzy time series (FTS) and causal graph to predict multivariate time series, marking the first such architecture in the literature. The key objective is to convert numerical time series into interpretable forms through the parallel application of fuzzification and causal analysis, enabling both semantic understanding and structural insight as input for the pretrained GPT-2 model. The resulting textual representation offers a more interpretable view of the complex dynamics underlying the original time series. The reported results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed LLM-based time series forecasting model, as demonstrated across four different multivariate time series datasets. This initiative paves promising future directions in the domain of TSF using LLMs based on FTS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the Brazilian Congress of Artificial Intelligence (CBIC)</p></details> |
| **[Unified Sparse-Matrix Representations for Diverse Neural Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01966v3)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks employ specialized architectures for vision, sequential and language tasks, yet this proliferation obscures their underlying commonalities. We introduce a unified matrix-order framework that casts convolutional, recurrent and self-attention operations as sparse matrix multiplications. Convolution is realized via an upper-triangular weight matrix performing first-order transformations; recurrence emerges from a lower-triangular matrix encoding stepwise updates; attention arises naturally as a third-order tensor factorization. We prove algebraic isomorphism with standard CNN, RNN and Transformer layers under mild assumptions. Empirical evaluations on image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, Tiny ImageNet), time-series forecasting (ETTh1, Electricity Load Diagrams) and language modeling/classification (AG News, WikiText-2, Penn Treebank) confirm that sparse-matrix formulations match or exceed native model performance while converging in comparable or fewer epochs. By reducing architecture design to sparse pattern selection, our matrix perspective aligns with GPU parallelism and leverages mature algebraic optimization tools. This work establishes a mathematically rigorous substrate for diverse neural architectures and opens avenues for principled, hardware-aware network design.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging techniques from random matrix theory and free probability, we provide sharp asymptotics for the in- and out-of-sample risks of ridge regression when the data points have arbitrary correlations. We demonstrate that in this setting, the generalized cross validation estimator (GCV) fails to correctly predict the out-of-sample risk. However, in the case where the noise residuals have the same correlations as the data points, one can modify the GCV to yield an efficiently-computable unbiased estimator that concentrates in the high-dimensional limit, which we dub CorrGCV. We further extend our asymptotic analysis to the case where the test point has nontrivial correlations with the training set, a setting often encountered in time series forecasting. Assuming knowledge of the correlation structure of the time series, this again yields an extension of the GCV estimator, and sharply characterizes the degree to which such test points yield an overly optimistic prediction of long-time risk. We validate the predictions of our theory across a variety of high dimensional data.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 19 figures. v4: ICML 2025 camera-ready. v5: Fix typo in statement of Theorem 5</p></details> |
| **[Canonical Correlation Patterns for Validating Clustering of Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16497v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustering of multivariate time series using correlation-based methods reveals regime changes in relationships between variables across health, finance, and industrial applications. However, validating whether discovered clusters represent distinct relationships rather than arbitrary groupings remains a fundamental challenge. Existing clustering validity indices were developed for Euclidean data, and their effectiveness for correlation patterns has not been systematically evaluated. Unlike Euclidean clustering, where geometric shapes provide discrete reference targets, correlations exist in continuous space without equivalent reference patterns. We address this validation gap by introducing canonical correlation patterns as mathematically defined validation targets that discretise the infinite correlation space into finite, interpretable reference patterns. Using synthetic datasets with perfect ground truth across controlled conditions, we demonstrate that canonical patterns provide reliable validation targets, with L1 norm for mapping and L5 norm for silhouette width criterion and Davies-Bouldin index showing superior performance. These methods are robust to distribution shifts and appropriately detect correlation structure degradation, enabling practical implementation guidelines. This work establishes a methodological foundation for rigorous correlation-based clustering validation in high-stakes domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Multimodal Forecasting of Sparse Intraoperative Hypotension Events Powered by Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22116v3)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) frequently occurs under general anesthesia and is strongly linked to adverse outcomes such as myocardial injury and increased mortality. Despite its significance, IOH prediction is hindered by event sparsity and the challenge of integrating static and dynamic data across diverse patients. In this paper, we propose \textbf{IOHFuseLM}, a multimodal language model framework. To accurately identify and differentiate sparse hypotensive events, we leverage a two-stage training strategy. The first stage involves domain adaptive pretraining on IOH physiological time series augmented through diffusion methods, thereby enhancing the model sensitivity to patterns associated with hypotension. Subsequently, task fine-tuning is performed on the original clinical dataset to further enhance the ability to distinguish normotensive from hypotensive states. To enable multimodal fusion for each patient, we align structured clinical descriptions with the corresponding physiological time series at the token level. Such alignment enables the model to capture individualized temporal patterns alongside their corresponding clinical semantics. In addition, we convert static patient attributes into structured text to enrich personalized information. Experimental evaluations on two intraoperative datasets demonstrate that IOHFuseLM outperforms established baselines in accurately identifying IOH events, highlighting its applicability in clinical decision support scenarios. Our code is publicly available to promote reproducibility at https://github.com/zjt-gpu/IOHFuseLM.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, the detection and localization of these interference signals are essential to achieve situational awareness, mitigating their impact, and implementing effective counter-measures. Classical Angle of Arrival (AoA) methods exhibit reduced accuracy in multipath environments due to signal reflections and scattering, leading to localization errors. Additionally, AoA-based techniques demand substantial computational resources for array signal processing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for detecting and classifying interference while estimating the distance, azimuth, and elevation of jamming sources. Our benchmark study evaluates 128 vision encoder and time-series models to identify the highest-performing methods for each task. We introduce an attention-based fusion framework that integrates in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-computed spectrograms while incorporating 22 AoA features to enhance localization accuracy. Furthermore, we present a novel dataset of moving jamming devices recorded in an indoor environment with dynamic multipath conditions and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 6 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Density Prediction of Income Distribution Based on Mixed Frequency Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16150v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling large dependent datasets in modern time series analysis is a crucial research area. One effective approach to handle such datasets is to transform the observations into density functions and apply statistical methods for further analysis. Income distribution forecasting, a common application scenario, benefits from predicting density functions as it accounts for uncertainty around point estimates, leading to more informed policy formulation. However, predictive modeling becomes challenging when dealing with mixed-frequency data. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a mixed data sampling regression model for probability density functions (PDF-MIDAS). To mitigate variance inflation caused by high-frequency prediction variables, we utilize exponential Almon polynomials with fewer parameters to regularize the coefficient structure. Additionally, we propose an iterative estimation method based on quadratic programming and the BFGS algorithm. Simulation analyses demonstrate that as the sample size for estimating density functions and observation length increase, the estimator approaches the true value. Real data analysis reveals that compared to single-sequence prediction models, PDF-MIDAS incorporating high-frequency exogenous variables offers a wider range of application scenarios with superior fitting and prediction performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpiroLLM: Finetuning Pretrained LLMs to Understand Spirogram Time Series with Clinical Validation in COPD Reporting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16145v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a major chronic respiratory disease with persistent airflow limitation, is a leading global cause of disability and mortality. Respiratory spirogram time series, routinely collected during pulmonary function tests (PFTs), play a critical role in the early detection of repsiratory diseases and in monitoring lung function over time. However, most current AI models for COPD diagnosis are limited to outputting classification results without providing a rationale for their diagnostic process, while current Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot understand spirograms yet, which severely limits their clinical trust and adoption. To tackle this challenge, we leverage a cohort of 234,028 individuals from the UK Biobank (UKB) to propose SpiroLLM, the first multimodal large language model that can understand spirogram. The model extracts morphological features from respiratory curves via a SpiroEncoder and aligns them with PFT numerical values in a unified latent space using a SpiroProjector, ultimately empowering a large language model to generate a comprehensive diagnostic report. Experimental results confirm that SpiroLLM achieved a diagnostic AUROC of 0.8980 (95% CI: 0.8820-0.9132). In a robustness test with missing core data, it maintained a 100% valid response rate, far surpassing the 13.4% of a text-only model and showcasing the superiority of its multimodal design. This work demonstrates the substantial potential of deeply fusing physiological signals with large language models, establishing a new paradigm for the next generation of interpretable and reliable clinical decision support tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predictive inference for discrete-valued time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16035v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For discrete-valued time series, predictive inference cannot be implemented through the construction of prediction intervals to some predetermined coverage level, as this is the case for real-valued time series. To address this problem, we propose to reverse the construction principle by considering preselected sets of interest and estimating the probability that a future observation of the process falls into these sets. The accuracy of the prediction is then evaluated by quantifying the uncertainty associated with estimation of these predictive probabilities. We consider parametric and non-parametric approaches and derive asymptotic theory for the estimators involved. Suitable bootstrap approaches to evaluate the distribution of the estimators considered also are introduced. They have the advantage to imitate the distributions of interest under different possible settings, including the practical important case where uncertainty holds true about the correctness of a parametric model used for prediction. Theoretical justification of the bootstrap is given, which also requires investigation of asymptotic properties of parameter estimators under model misspecification. We elaborate on bootstrap implementations under different scenarios and focus on parametric prediction using INAR and INARCH models and (conditional) maximum likelihood estimators. Simulations investigate the finite sample performance of the predictive method developed and applications to real life data sets are presented.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 2 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Often, it is of interest to study how these networks change under different conditions. For instance, to better understand epilepsy, it would be interesting to capture the changes in the brain connectivity network as a patient experiences a seizure, using electroencephalography data. A common approach relies on estimating the networks in each condition and calculating their difference. Such estimates may behave poorly in high dimensions as the networks themselves may not be sparse in structure while their difference may be. We build upon this observation to develop an estimator of the difference in inverse spectral densities across two conditions. Using an L1 penalty on the difference, consistency is established by only requiring the difference to be sparse. We illustrate the method on synthetic data experiments and on experiments with electroencephalography data.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 13 figures, AISTATS 2025</p></details> |

Various methods have been developed to construct hypergraphs -- referred to as simplicial complexes in the TDA framework -- over datasets, enabling the formation of edges between more than two vertices. This paper addresses the challenge of constructing hypergraphs from collections of multivariate time series. While prior work has focused on the case of a single multivariate time series, we extend this framework to handle collections of such time series. Our approach generalizes the method proposed in Chretien and al. by leveraging the properties of signature transforms to introduce controlled randomness, thereby enhancing the robustness of the construction process.

Knowledge graphs can contextualize these data, yet current approaches that are applicably to monitoring CPS rely on observation-based approaches. This limits the ability to express computations on sensor data, especially when no assumptions can be made about sampling synchronicity or sampling rates. Methodology: We propose an approach for integrating knowledge graphs with signals that model run-time sensor data as functions from time to data. To demonstrate this approach, we introduce SigSPARQL, a query language that can combine RDF data and signals. We assess its technical feasibility with a prototype and demonstrate its use in a typical CPS monitoring use case. Findings: Our approach enables queries to combine graph-based knowledge with signals, overcoming some key limits of observation-based methods. The developed prototype successfully demonstrated feasibility and applicability. Value: This work presents a query-based approach for CPS monitoring that integrates knowledge graphs and signals, alleviating problems of observation-based approaches. By leveraging system knowledge, it enables operators to run a single query across different system instances within the same domain. Future work will extend SigSPARQL with additional signal functions and evaluate it in large-scale CPS deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dictionary-Learning-Based Data Pruning for System Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11484v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>System identification is normally involved in augmenting time series data by time shifting and nonlinearisation (e.g., polynomial basis), both of which introduce redundancy in features and samples. Many research works focus on reducing redundancy feature-wise, while less attention is paid to sample-wise redundancy. This paper proposes a novel data pruning method, called mini-batch FastCan, to reduce sample-wise redundancy based on dictionary learning. Time series data is represented by some representative samples, called atoms, via dictionary learning. The useful samples are selected based on their correlation with the atoms. The method is tested on one simulated dataset and two benchmark datasets. The R-squared between the coefficients of models trained on the full datasets and the coefficients of models trained on pruned datasets is adopted to evaluate the performance of data pruning methods. It is found that the proposed method significantly outperforms the random pruning method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prediction of linear fractional stable motions using codifference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15437v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The linear fractional stable motion (LFSM) extends the fractional Brownian motion (fBm) by considering $\alpha$-stable increments. We propose a method to forecast future increments of the LFSM from past discrete-time observations, using the conditional expectation when $\alpha>1$ or a semimetric projection otherwise. It relies on the codifference, which describes the serial dependence of the process, instead of the covariance. Indeed, covariance is commonly used for predicting an fBm but it is infinite when $\alpha<2$. Some theoretical properties of the method and of its accuracy are studied and both a simulation study and an application to real data confirm the relevance of the approach. The LFSM-based method outperforms the fBm, when forecasting high-frequency FX rates. It also shows a promising performance in the forecast of time series of volatilities, decomposing properly, in the fractal dynamic of rough volatilities, the contribution of the kurtosis of the increments and the contribution of their serial dependence. Moreover, the analysis of hit ratios suggests that, beside independence, persistence, and antipersistence, a fourth regime of serial dependence exists for fractional processes, characterized by a selective memory controlled by a few large increments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Central limit theory for Peaks-over-Threshold partial sums of long memory linear time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20789v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the last 30 years, extensive work has been devoted to developing central limit theory for partial sums of subordinated long memory linear time series. A much less studied problem, motivated by questions that are ubiquitous in extreme value theory, is the asymptotic behavior of such partial sums when the subordination mechanism has a threshold depending on sample size, so as to focus on the right tail of the time series. This article substantially extends longstanding asymptotic techniques by allowing the subordination mechanism to depend on the sample size in this way and to grow at a polynomial rate, while permitting the innovation process to have infinite variance. The cornerstone of our theoretical approach is a tailored $L^r(\mathbf{P})$ reduction principle, which enables the use of classical results on partial sums of long memory linear processes. In this way we obtain asymptotic theory for certain Peaks-over-Threshold estimators with deterministic or random thresholds. Applications comprise both the heavy- and light-tailed regimes -- yielding unexpected results which, to the best of our knowledge, are new to the literature. A simulation study illustrates the relevance of our findings in finite samples.</p></details> | 60 pages, 4 figures |

Functional connectivity can be represented by correlation matrices computed over time, where each matrix captures the Pearson correlation between the mean fMRI signals of different regions within a sliding window. We introduce several Log-Euclidean Riemannian framework for constructing smooth approximations of functional brain connectivity trajectories. Representing dynamic functional connectivity as time series of full-rank correlation matrices, we leverage recent theoretical Log-Euclidean diffeomorphisms to map these trajectories in practice into Euclidean spaces where polynomial regression becomes feasible. Pulling back the regressed curve ensures that each estimated point remains a valid correlation matrix, enabling a smooth, interpretable, and geometrically consistent approximation of the original brain connectivity dynamics. Experiments on fMRI-derived connectivity trajectories demonstrate the geometric consistency and computational efficiency of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variational Mode-Driven Graph Convolutional Network for Spatiotemporal Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16191v3)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on spatiotemporal (ST) traffic prediction using graph neural networks (GNNs). Given that ST data comprises non-stationary and complex temporal patterns, interpreting and predicting such trends is inherently challenging. Representing ST data in decomposed modes helps infer underlying behavior and assess the impact of noise on predictive performance. We propose a framework that decomposes ST data into interpretable modes using variational mode decomposition (VMD) and processes them through a neural network for future state forecasting. Unlike existing graph-based traffic forecasters that operate directly on raw or aggregated time series, the proposed hybrid approach, termed the Variational Mode Graph Convolutional Network (VMGCN), first decomposes non-stationary signals into interpretable variational modes by determining the optimal mode count via reconstruction-loss minimization and then learns both intramode and cross-mode spatiotemporal dependencies through a novel attention-augmented GCN. Additionally, we analyze the significance of each mode and the effect of bandwidth constraints on multi-horizon traffic flow predictions. The proposed two-stage design yields significant accuracy gains while providing frequency-level interpretability with demonstrated superior performance on the LargeST dataset for both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks. The implementation is publicly available on https://github.com/OsamaAhmad369/VMGCN.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM T...</summary><p>ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST) Submission, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Preferential subspace identification (PSID) with forward-backward smoothing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15288v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>System identification methods for multivariate time-series, such as neural and behavioral recordings, have been used to build models for predicting one from the other. For example, Preferential Subspace Identification (PSID) builds a state-space model of a primary time-series (e.g., neural activity) to optimally predict a secondary time-series (e.g., behavior). However, PSID focuses on optimal prediction using past primary data, even though in offline applications, better estimation can be achieved by incorporating concurrent data (filtering) or all available data (smoothing). Here, we extend PSID to enable optimal filtering and smoothing. First, we show that the presence of a secondary signal makes it possible to uniquely identify a model with an optimal Kalman update step (to enable filtering) from a family of otherwise equivalent state-space models. Our filtering solution augments PSID with a reduced-rank regression step that directly learns the optimal gain required for the update step from data. We refer to this extension of PSID as PSID with filtering. Second, inspired by two-filter Kalman smoother formulations, we develop a novel forward-backward PSID smoothing algorithm where we first apply PSID with filtering and then apply it again in the reverse time direction on the residuals of the filtered secondary signal. We validate our methods on simulated data, showing that our approach recovers the ground-truth model parameters for filtering, and achieves optimal filtering and smoothing decoding performance of the secondary signal that matches the ideal performance of the true underlying model. This work provides a principled framework for optimal linear filtering and smoothing in the two-signal setting, significantly expanding the toolkit for analyzing dynamic interactions in multivariate time-series.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

The process begins with a denoising autoencoder to filter out random noise fluctuations from the main contract price data. Then, one-dimensional convolution reduces the dimensionality of the filtered data and extracts key information. The filtered and dimensionality-reduced price data is fed into a GANs network, and its output serve as input of a fully connected network. Through cross-validation, a model is trained to capture features that precede large price fluctuations. The model predicts the likelihood and direction of significant price changes in real-time price sequences, placing trades at moments of high prediction accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that using autoencoders and convolution to filter and denoise financial data, combined with GANs, achieves a certain level of predictive performance, validating the capabilities of machine learning algorithms to discover underlying patterns in financial sequences.

We propose using data sampled from the real model $\mathbb P$ (which is unknown) with limited size to train a generative model $\mathbb Q$ (from which we can easily and adequately sample). With adaptive training and sampling methods that are tailor-made for time series data, we obtain quantification bounds between $\mathbb P$ and $\mathbb Q$ in terms of the adapted Wasserstein metric $\mathcal A W_2$. Importantly, the proposed adapted sampling method also facilitates {\it conditional sampling}. In the second part of this paper, we provide the stability of the mean-variance portfolio optimization problems in $\mathcal A W _2$. Then, combined with the error bounds and the stability result, we propose a policy gradient algorithm based on the generative environment, in which our innovative adapted sampling method provides approximate scenario generators. We illustrate the performance of our algorithm on both simulated and real data. For real data, the algorithm based on the generative environment produces portfolios that beat several important baselines, including the Markowitz portfolio, the equal weight (naive) portfolio, and S\&P 500.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available on https://github.com/fy-yuan/diffusion_dynamic_mv. v2 addresses certain typos and small issues</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Conformal Prediction (TCP): A Distribution-Free Statistical and Machine Learning Framework for Adaptive Risk Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05470v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Temporal Conformal Prediction (TCP), a principled framework for constructing well-calibrated prediction intervals for non-stationary time series. TCP integrates a machine learning-based quantile forecaster with an online conformal calibration layer. This layer's thresholds are updated via a modified Robbins-Monro scheme, allowing the model to dynamically adapt to volatility clustering and regime shifts without rigid parametric assumptions. We benchmark TCP against GARCH, Historical Simulation, and static Quantile Regression across diverse financial assets. Our empirical results reveal a critical flaw in static methods: while sharp, Quantile Regression is poorly calibrated, systematically over-covering the nominal 95% target. In contrast, TCP's adaptive mechanism actively works to achieve the correct coverage level, successfully navigating the coverage-sharpness tradeoff. Visualizations during the 2020 market crash confirm TCP's superior adaptive response, and a comprehensive sensitivity analysis demonstrates the framework's robustness to hyperparameter choices. Overall, TCP offers a practical and theoretically-grounded solution to the central challenge of calibrated uncertainty quantification for time series under distribution shift, advancing the interface between statistical inference and machine learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[CROSS-GAiT: Cross-Attention-Based Multimodal Representation Fusion for Parametric Gait Adaptation in Complex Terrains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17262v3)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present CROSS-GAiT, a novel algorithm for quadruped robots that uses Cross Attention to fuse terrain representations derived from visual and time-series inputs; including linear accelerations, angular velocities, and joint efforts. These fused representations are used to continuously adjust two critical gait parameters (step height and hip splay), enabling adaptive gaits that respond dynamically to varying terrain conditions. To generate terrain representations, we process visual inputs through a masked Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder and time-series data through a dilated causal convolutional encoder. The Cross Attention mechanism then selects and integrates the most relevant features from each modality, combining terrain characteristics with robot dynamics for informed gait adaptation. This fused representation allows CROSS-GAiT to continuously adjust gait parameters in response to unpredictable terrain conditions in real-time. We train CROSS-GAiT on a diverse set of terrains including asphalt, concrete, brick pavements, grass, dense vegetation, pebbles, gravel, and sand and validate its generalization ability on unseen environments. Our hardware implementation on the Ghost Robotics Vision 60 demonstrates superior performance in challenging terrains, such as high-density vegetation, unstable surfaces, sandbanks, and deformable substrates. We observe at least a 7.04% reduction in IMU energy density and a 27.3% reduction in total joint effort, which directly correlates with increased stability and reduced energy usage when compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, CROSS-GAiT demonstrates at least a 64.5% increase in success rate and a 4.91% reduction in time to reach the goal in four complex scenarios. Additionally, the learned representations perform 4.48% better than the state-of-the-art on a terrain classification task.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we will study the impact of noise on the learning capabilities of analog reservoir computers. Recent work on reservoir computation has shown that the information processing capacity (IPC) is a useful metric for quantifying the degradation of the performance due to noise. We further this analysis and demonstrate that this degradation of the IPC limits the possible features that can be meaningfully constructed in an analog reservoir computing setting. We borrow a result from quantum complexity theory that relates the circuit model of computation to a continuous time model, and demonstrate an exponential reduction in the accessible volume of reservoir configurations. We conclude by relating this degradation in the IPC to the fat-shattering dimension of a family of functions describing the reservoir dynamics, which allows us to express our result in terms of a classification task. We conclude that any physical, analog reservoir computer that is exposed to noise can only be used to perform a polynomial amount of learning, despite the exponentially large latent space, even with an exponential amount of post-processing.</p></details> | 12 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Are We Overlooking the Dimensions? Learning Latent Hierarchical Channel Structure for High-Dimensional Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15119v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting (TSF) is a central problem in time series analysis. However, as the number of channels in time series datasets scales to the thousands or more, a scenario we define as High-Dimensional Time Series Forecasting (HDTSF), it introduces significant new modeling challenges that are often not the primary focus of traditional TSF research. HDTSF is challenging because the channel correlation often forms complex and hierarchical patterns. Existing TSF models either ignore these interactions or fail to scale as dimensionality grows. To address this issue, we propose U-Cast, a channel-dependent forecasting architecture that learns latent hierarchical channel structures with an innovative query-based attention. To disentangle highly correlated channel representation, U-Cast adds a full-rank regularization during training. We also release Time-HD, a benchmark of large, diverse, high-dimensional datasets. Our theory shows that exploiting cross-channel information lowers forecasting risk, and experiments on Time-HD demonstrate that U-Cast surpasses strong baselines in both accuracy and efficiency. Together, U-Cast and Time-HD provide a solid basis for future HDTSF research.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we propose a novel task, Time-series Reasoning for Anomaly (Time-RA) that transforms classical time series anomaly detection from a discriminative into a generative, reasoning-intensive task leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Also, we introduce the first real-world multimodal benchmark dataset, RATs40K, explicitly annotated for anomaly reasoning, comprising approximately 40,000 samples across 10 real-world domains. Each sample includes numeric time series data, contextual text information, and visual representations, each annotated with fine-grained categories (14 types for univariate anomalies and 6 for multivariate anomalies) and structured explanatory reasoning. We develop a sophisticated annotation framework utilizing ensemble-generated labels refined through GPT-4-driven feedback, ensuring accuracy and interpretability. Extensive benchmarking of LLMs and multimodal LLMs demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of current models, highlighting the critical role of supervised fine-tuning. Our dataset and task pave the way for significant advancements in interpretable time series anomaly detection and reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review. 19 pages, 8 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

We fit two linear slopes to the data with the constraint that they merge at the point in time where the slope changes. We compare such fits to a standard linear regression in two ways: We use Akaike's and the Bayesian information criteria for model selection, and we test against the null hypothesis of no change of the trend value. For those grid points where the dual linear fit is superior, we construct maps of the time when the trend changes, and of the warming trends in both time intervals. In doing so, we indentify areas where warming speeds up, but find as well areas where warming slows down. We thereby contribute to the characterization of local effects of climate change. We find that many grid points exhibit a change to a much stronger warming trend around the 1980s. This raises the question of whether the climate system has already passed some tipping point.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

Exploring time-varying data is critical for data science practitioners aiming to understand dynamic behaviors and discover periodic patterns and trends. However, the analysis of such data often requires sophisticated procedures and tools. Information visualization is a communication channel that leverages human perceptual abilities to transform abstract data into visual representations. Visualization techniques have been successfully applied in the context of time series to enhance interpretability by graphically representing the temporal evolution of data. The challenge for information visualization developers lies in integrating a wide range of analytical tools into rich visualization systems that can summarize complex datasets while clearly describing the impacts of the temporal component. Such systems enable data scientists to turn raw data into understandable and potentially useful knowledge. This review examines techniques and approaches designed for handling time series data, guiding users through knowledge discovery processes based on visual analysis. We also provide readers with theoretical insights and design guidelines for considering when developing comprehensive information visualization approaches for time series, with a particular focus on time series with multiple features. As a result, we highlight the challenges and future research directions to address open questions in the visualization of time-dependent data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

With the cellular traffic demand increasing so dramatically, it is now necessary to accurately predict the user traffic in cellular networks, so as to improve the performance in terms of resource allocation and utilisation. Since traffic learning and prediction is a classical and appealing field, which still yields many meaningful results, there has been an increasing interest in leveraging Machine Learning tools to analyse the total traffic served in a given region, to optimise the operation of the network. With the help of this project, we seek to exploit the traffic history by using it to predict the nature and occurrence of future traffic. Furthermore, we classify the traffic into particular application types, to increase our understanding of the nature of the traffic. By leveraging the power of machine learning and identifying its usefulness in the field of cellular networks we try to achieve three main objectives - classification of the application generating the traffic, prediction of packet arrival intensity and burst occurrence. The design of the prediction and classification system is done using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model. The LSTM predictor developed in this experiment would return the number of uplink packets and also estimate the probability of burst occurrence in the specified future time interval. For the purpose of classification, the regression layer in our LSTM prediction model is replaced by a softmax classifier which is used to classify the application generating the cellular traffic into one of the four applications including surfing, video calling, voice calling, and video streaming.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |

Specifically, we explore whether an adaptive margin (eMargin), adjusted based on a predefined similarity threshold, can improve the separation between adjacent but dissimilar time steps and subsequently lead to better performance in downstream tasks. Our study evaluates the impact of this modification on clustering performance and classification in three benchmark datasets. Our findings, however, indicate that achieving high scores on unsupervised clustering metrics does not necessarily imply that the learned embeddings are meaningful or effective in downstream tasks. To be specific, eMargin added to InfoNCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in unsupervised clustering metrics, but struggles to achieve competitive results in downstream classification with linear probing.

Accurate detection and classification of UAV flight states, such as hovering, cruising, ascending, or transitioning, which are essential for safe and effective operations. However, conventional time series classification (TSC) methods often lack robustness and generalization for dynamic UAV environments, while state of the art(SOTA) models like Transformers and LSTM based architectures typically require large datasets and entail high computational costs, especially with high-dimensional data streams. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates a Transformer-based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with Multiple Instance Locally Explainable Learning (MILET) to address these challenges in UAV flight state classification. The Transformer encoder captures long-range temporal dependencies and complex telemetry dynamics, while the GAN module augments limited datasets with realistic synthetic samples. MIL is incorporated to focus attention on the most discriminative input segments, reducing noise and computational overhead. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superior accuracy 96.5% on the DroneDetect dataset and 98.6% on the DroneRF dataset that outperforming other SOTA approaches. The framework also demonstrates strong computational efficiency and robust generalization across diverse UAV platforms and flight states, highlighting its potential for real-time deployment in resource constrained environments.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

Recently, their application has expanded to time series forecasting (TSF), yielding promising results. In this survey, we firstly introduce the standard diffusion models and their prevalent variants, explaining their adaptation to TSF tasks. We then provide a comprehensive review of diffusion models for TSF, paying special attention to the sources of conditional information and the mechanisms for integrating this conditioning within the models. In analyzing existing approaches using diffusion models for TSF, we provide a systematic categorization and a comprehensive summary of them in this survey. Furthermore, we examine several foundational diffusion models applied to TSF, alongside commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss current limitations in these approaches and potential future research directions. Overall, this survey details recent progress and future prospects for diffusion models in TSF, serving as a reference for researchers in the field.</p></details> |  |

The BGAR model generalizes the bivariate vector autoregressive (VAR) models by allowing data that does not necessarily follow a normal distribution. We consider a random vector of two time series and assume each belongs to the canonical exponential family, similarly to the univariate generalized autoregressive moving average (GARMA) model. We include autoregressive terms of one series into the dynamical structure of the other and vice versa. The model parameters are estimated using the conditional maximum likelihood (CML) method. We provide general closed-form expressions for the conditional score vector and conditional Fisher information matrix, encompassing all canonical exponential family distributions. We develop asymptotic confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. We discuss techniques for model selection, residual diagnostic analysis, and forecasting. We carry out Monte Carlo simulation studies to evaluate the performance of the finite sample CML inferences, including point and interval estimation. An application to real data analyzes the number of leptospirosis cases on hospitalizations due to leptospirosis in S\~ao Paulo state, Brazil. Competing models such as GARMA, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and VAR models are considered for comparison purposes. The new model outperforms the competing models by providing more accurate out-of-sample forecasting and allowing quantification of the lagged effect of the case count series on hospitalizations due to leptospirosis.</p></details> |  |

While Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods provide exact samples from the posterior distribution as the number of samples goes to infinity, they tend to have high computational cost, particularly for observations of a long time series. When inference with MCMC methods is computationally expensive, variational Bayes (VB) methods are a useful alternative. VB methods approximate the posterior density of the parameters with a simple and tractable distribution found through optimisation. This work proposes a novel sequential VB approach that makes use of the Whittle likelihood for computationally efficient parameter inference in linear, non-Gaussian state space models. Our algorithm, called Recursive Variational Gaussian Approximation with the Whittle Likelihood (R-VGA-Whittle), updates the variational parameters by processing data in the frequency domain. At each iteration, R-VGA-Whittle requires the gradient and Hessian of the Whittle log-likelihood, which are available in closed form. Through several examples involving a linear Gaussian state space model; a univariate/bivariate stochastic volatility model; and a state space model with Student's t measurement error, where the latent states follow an autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA) model, we show that R-VGA-Whittle provides good approximations to posterior distributions of the parameters, and that it is very computationally efficient when compared to asymptotically exact methods such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.</p></details> |  |

When a user asks a question, the system automatically analyzes the full history of sensor data, extracts relevant information, and generates an appropriate response. However, existing systems are limited to short-duration (e.g., one minute) or low-frequency (e.g., daily step count) sensor data. In addition, they struggle with quantitative questions that require precise numerical answers. In this work, we introduce SensorChat, the first end-to-end QA system designed for daily life monitoring using long-duration, high-frequency time series data. Given raw sensor signals spanning multiple days and a user-defined natural language question, SensorChat generates semantically meaningful responses that directly address user concerns. SensorChat effectively handles both quantitative questions that require numerical precision and qualitative questions that require high-level reasoning to infer subjective insights. To achieve this, SensorChat uses an innovative three-stage pipeline including question decomposition, sensor data query, and answer assembly. The first and third stages leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret human queries and generate responses. The intermediate querying stage extracts relevant information from the complete sensor data history. Real-world implementations demonstrate SensorChat's capability for real-time interactions on a cloud server while also being able to run entirely on edge platforms after quantization. Comprehensive QA evaluations show that SensorChat achieves 93% higher answer accuracy than the best performing state-of-the-art systems on quantitative questions. Furthermore, a user study with eight volunteers highlights SensorChat's effectiveness in answering qualitative questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in IMWUT'25.

However, their general-purpose design can limit domain-specific precision, and the proprietary nature of many models poses challenges for fine-tuning on specialized clinical datasets. Conversely, small specialized models (SSMs) offer strong performance on focused tasks but lack the broader reasoning needed for complex medical decision-making. To address these complementary limitations, we introduce \ConMIL{} (Conformalized Multiple Instance Learning), a novel decision-support framework distinctively synergizes three key components: (1) a new Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) mechanism, QTrans-Pooling, designed for per-class interpretability in identifying clinically relevant physiological signal segments; (2) conformal prediction, integrated with MIL to generate calibrated, set-valued outputs with statistical reliability guarantees; and (3) a structured approach for these interpretable and uncertainty-quantified SSM outputs to enhance the visual inspection capabilities of LLMs. Our experiments on arrhythmia detection and sleep stage classification demonstrate that \ConMIL{} can enhance the accuracy of LLMs such as ChatGPT4.0, Qwen2-VL-7B, and MiMo-VL-7B-RL. For example, \ConMIL{}-supported Qwen2-VL-7B and MiMo-VL-7B-RL both achieves 94.92% and 96.82% precision on confident samples and (70.61% and 78.02%)/(78.10% and 71.98%) on uncertain samples for the two tasks, compared to 46.13% and 13.16% using the LLM alone. These results suggest that integrating task-specific models with LLMs may offer a promising pathway toward more interpretable and trustworthy AI-driven clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparing skill of historical rainfall data based monsoon rainfall prediction in India with NWP forecasts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07851v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Indian summer monsoon is a highly complex and critical weather system that directly affects the livelihoods of over a billion people across the Indian subcontinent. Accurate short-term forecasting remains a major scientific challenge due to the monsoon's intrinsic nonlinearity and its sensitivity to multi-scale drivers, including local land-atmosphere interactions and large-scale ocean-atmosphere phenomena. In this study, we address the problem of forecasting daily rainfall across India during the summer months, focusing on both one-day and three-day lead times. We use Autoformers - deep learning transformer-based architectures designed for time series forecasting. These are trained on historical gridded precipitation data from the Indian Meteorological Department (1901--2023) at spatial resolutions of $0.25^\circ \times 0.25^\circ$, as well as $1^\circ \times 1^\circ$. The models also incorporate auxiliary meteorological variables from ECMWFs reanalysis datasets, namely, cloud cover, humidity, temperature, soil moisture, vorticity, and wind speed. Forecasts at $0.25^\circ \times 0.25^\circ$ are benchmarked against ECMWFs High-Resolution Ensemble System (HRES), widely regarded as the most accurate numerical weather predictor, and at $1^\circ \times 1^\circ $ with those from National Centre for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). We conduct both nationwide evaluations and localized analyses for major Indian cities. Our results indicate that transformer-based deep learning models consistently outperform both HRES and NCEP, as well as other climatological baselines. Specifically, compared to our model, forecasts from HRES and NCEP model have about 22\% and 43\% higher error, respectively, for a single day prediction, and over 27\% and 66\% higher error respectively, for a three day prediction.</p></details> |  |

Standard Dirichlet time series models assume constant precision and therefore miss these episodes. We introduce B-DARMA-DARCH, a Bayesian Dirichlet autoregressive moving average model with a Dirichlet ARCH component, which lets the precision parameter follow an ARMA recursion. The specification preserves the Dirichlet likelihood so forecasts remain valid compositions while capturing clustered volatility. Simulations and out-of-sample tests show that B-DARMA-DARCH lowers forecast error and improves interval calibration relative to Dirichlet ARMA and log-ratio VARMA benchmarks, providing a concise framework for settings where both the level and the volatility of proportions matter.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Temporal Causal Representation Learning with Tensor Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14126v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal causal representation learning is a powerful tool for uncovering complex patterns in observational studies, which are often represented as low-dimensional time series. However, in many real-world applications, data are high-dimensional with varying input lengths and naturally take the form of irregular tensors. To analyze such data, irregular tensor decomposition is critical for extracting meaningful clusters that capture essential information. In this paper, we focus on modeling causal representation learning based on the transformed information. First, we present a novel causal formulation for a set of latent clusters. We then propose CaRTeD, a joint learning framework that integrates temporal causal representation learning with irregular tensor decomposition. Notably, our framework provides a blueprint for downstream tasks using the learned tensor factors, such as modeling latent structures and extracting causal information, and offers a more flexible regularization design to enhance tensor decomposition. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm converges to a stationary point. More importantly, our results fill the gap in theoretical guarantees for the convergence of state-of-the-art irregular tensor decomposition. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world electronic health record (EHR) datasets (MIMIC-III), with extensive benchmarks from both phenotyping and network recovery perspectives, demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and enhances the explainability of causal representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Practical Operation of Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents in Real-World Network Management at Open RAN Edges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23086v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful solution for meeting the growing demands for connectivity, reliability, low latency and operational efficiency in advanced networks. However, most research has focused on theoretical analysis and simulations, with limited investigation into real-world deployment. To bridge the gap and support practical DRL deployment for network management, we first present an orchestration framework that integrates ETSI Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) with Open RAN, enabling seamless adoption of DRL-based strategies across different time scales while enhancing agent lifecycle management. We then identify three critical challenges hindering DRL's real-world deployment, including (1) asynchronous requests from unpredictable or bursty traffic, (2) adaptability and generalization across heterogeneous topologies and evolving service demands, and (3) prolonged convergence and service interruptions due to exploration in live operational environments. To address these challenges, we propose a three-fold solution strategy: (a) advanced time-series integration for handling asynchronized traffic, (b) flexible architecture design such as multi-agent DRL and incremental learning to support heterogeneous scenarios, and (c) simulation-driven deployment with transfer learning to reduce convergence time and service disruptions. Lastly, the feasibility of the MEC-O-RAN architecture is validated on an urban-wide testing infrastructure, and two real-world use cases are presented, showcasing the three identified challenges and demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[ParallelTime: Dynamically Weighting the Balance of Short- and Long-Term Temporal Dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13998v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern multivariate time series forecasting primarily relies on two architectures: the Transformer with attention mechanism and Mamba. In natural language processing, an approach has been used that combines local window attention for capturing short-term dependencies and Mamba for capturing long-term dependencies, with their outputs averaged to assign equal weight to both. We find that for time-series forecasting tasks, assigning equal weight to long-term and short-term dependencies is not optimal. To mitigate this, we propose a dynamic weighting mechanism, ParallelTime Weighter, which calculates interdependent weights for long-term and short-term dependencies for each token based on the input and the model's knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce the ParallelTime architecture, which incorporates the ParallelTime Weighter mechanism to deliver state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks. Our architecture demonstrates robustness, achieves lower FLOPs, requires fewer parameters, scales effectively to longer prediction horizons, and significantly outperforms existing methods. These advances highlight a promising path for future developments of parallel Attention-Mamba in time series forecasting.

| **[GRAM-MAMBA: Holistic Feature Alignment for Wireless Perception with Adaptive Low-Rank Compensation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13803v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal fusion is crucial for Internet of Things (IoT) perception, widely deployed in smart homes, intelligent transport, industrial automation, and healthcare. However, existing systems often face challenges: high model complexity hinders deployment in resource-constrained environments, unidirectional modal alignment neglects inter-modal relationships, and robustness suffers when sensor data is missing. These issues impede efficient and robust multimodal perception in real-world IoT settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose GRAM-MAMBA. This framework utilizes the linear-complexity Mamba model for efficient sensor time-series processing, combined with an optimized GRAM matrix strategy for pairwise alignment among modalities, addressing the shortcomings of traditional single-modality alignment. Inspired by Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we introduce an adaptive low-rank layer compensation strategy to handle missing modalities post-training. This strategy freezes the pre-trained model core and irrelevant adaptive layers, fine-tuning only those related to available modalities and the fusion process. Extensive experiments validate GRAM-MAMBA's effectiveness. On the SPAWC2021 indoor positioning dataset, the pre-trained model shows lower error than baselines; adapting to missing modalities yields a 24.5% performance boost by training less than 0.2% of parameters. On the USC-HAD human activity recognition dataset, it achieves 93.55% F1 and 93.81% Overall Accuracy (OA), outperforming prior work; the update strategy increases F1 by 23% while training less than 0.3% of parameters. These results highlight GRAM-MAMBA's potential for achieving efficient and robust multimodal perception in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pseudo-variance quasi-maximum likelihood estimation of semi-parametric time series models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06100v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel estimation approach for a general class of semi-parametric time series models where the conditional expectation is modeled through a parametric function. The proposed class of estimators is based on a Gaussian quasi-likelihood function and it relies on the specification of a parametric pseudo-variance that can contain parametric restrictions with respect to the conditional expectation. The specification of the pseudo-variance and the parametric restrictions follow naturally in observation-driven models with bounds in the support of the observable process, such as count processes and double-bounded time series. We derive the asymptotic properties of the estimators and a validity test for the parameter restrictions. We show that the results remain valid irrespective of the correct specification of the pseudo-variance. The key advantage of the restricted estimators is that they can achieve higher efficiency compared to alternative quasi-likelihood methods that are available in the literature. Furthermore, the testing approach can be used to build specification tests for parametric time series models. We illustrate the practical use of the methodology in a simulation study and two empirical applications featuring integer-valued autoregressive processes, where assumptions on the dispersion of the thinning operator are formally tested, and autoregressions for double-bounded data with application to a realized correlation time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Journal of Econometrics</p></details> |

The focus of the estimation is the conditional mean parameter vector for non-negative time series. Quasi-Maximum Likelihood Estimators (QMLEs) based on the linear exponential family are typically employed for such estimation problems when the true multivariate conditional probability distribution is unknown or too complex. Although QMLEs provide consistent estimates they may be inefficient. Novel two-stage Multivariate Weighted Least Square Estimators (MWLSEs) are introduced which enjoy the same consistency property as the QMLEs but provide improved efficiency with a suitable choice of the weighting sequence of matrices in the second stage. The proposed method enables a more accurate estimation of model parameters, particularly for data where maximum likelihood estimation is infeasible. Moreover, consistency and asymptotic normality of MWLSEs are derived, and their efficiency is proved under the correct specification of the weighting sequence. The estimation performance of QMLE and MWLSE is also compared through simulation experiments and a real data application, showing the superior accuracy of the proposed methodology.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Econometrics and Statistics</p></details> |
| **[Feature Engineering is Not Dead: Reviving Classical Machine Learning with Entropy, HOG, and LBP Feature Fusion for Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13772v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature engineering continues to play a critical role in image classification, particularly when interpretability and computational efficiency are prioritized over deep learning models with millions of parameters. In this study, we revisit classical machine learning based image classification through a novel approach centered on Permutation Entropy (PE), a robust and computationally lightweight measure traditionally used in time series analysis but rarely applied to image data. We extend PE to two-dimensional images and propose a multiscale, multi-orientation entropy-based feature extraction approach that characterizes spatial order and complexity along rows, columns, diagonals, anti-diagonals, and local patches of the image. To enhance the discriminatory power of the entropy features, we integrate two classic image descriptors: the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to capture shape and edge structure, and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to encode micro-texture of an image. The resulting hand-crafted feature set, comprising of 780 dimensions, is used to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers optimized through grid search. The proposed approach is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, including Fashion-MNIST, KMNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10, where it delivers competitive classification performance without relying on deep architectures. Our results demonstrate that the fusion of PE with HOG and LBP provides a compact, interpretable, and effective alternative to computationally expensive and limited interpretable deep learning models. This shows a potential of entropy-based descriptors in image classification and contributes a lightweight and generalizable solution to interpretable machine learning in image classification and computer vision.</p></details> |  |

Yet, the crucial task of out-of-domain imputation of missing values remains largely underexplored. We propose a first step to fill this gap by leveraging implicit neural representations (INRs). INRs model time series as continuous functions and naturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they have shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle under distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of Timeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation. Building on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen patterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a distinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the observed context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and out-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block and pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for adaptable foundation imputation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10th ...</summary><p>10th Workshop on Advanced Analytics and Learning on Temporal Data (AALTD), ECML 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods have significant drawbacks, such as their lack of accuracy in early predictions and their dependence on training and testing within the same year and specific time frames. These issues limit their practical use, particularly with out-of-time data. To address these, the study introduces two innovative architectures, GRU-KAN and LSTM-KAN, which merge Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The proposed models were evaluated against the baseline models (LSTM, GRU, LSTM-Attention, and LSTM-Transformer) in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 and AUC in different lengths of feature window, sample sizes, and early prediction intervals. The results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a prediction accuracy of over 92% three months in advance and over 88% eight months in advance, significantly outperforming existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Series Forecastability Measures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13556v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes using two metrics to quantify the forecastability of time series prior to model development: the spectral predictability score and the largest Lyapunov exponent. Unlike traditional model evaluation metrics, these measures assess the inherent forecastability characteristics of the data before any forecast attempts. The spectral predictability score evaluates the strength and regularity of frequency components in the time series, whereas the Lyapunov exponents quantify the chaos and stability of the system generating the data. We evaluated the effectiveness of these metrics on both synthetic and real-world time series from the M5 forecast competition dataset. Our results demonstrate that these two metrics can correctly reflect the inherent forecastability of a time series and have a strong correlation with the actual forecast performance of various models. By understanding the inherent forecastability of time series before model training, practitioners can focus their planning efforts on products and supply chain levels that are more forecastable, while setting appropriate expectations or seeking alternative strategies for products with limited forecastability.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCOPE for Hexapod Gait Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13539v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evolutionary methods have previously been shown to be an effective learning method for walking gaits on hexapod robots. However, the ability of these algorithms to evolve an effective policy rapidly degrades as the input space becomes more complex. This degradation is due to the exponential growth of the solution space, resulting from an increasing parameter count to handle a more complex input. In order to address this challenge, we introduce Sparse Cosine Optimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to learn directly from the feature coefficients of an input matrix. By truncating the coefficient matrix returned by the DCT, we can reduce the dimensionality of an input while retaining the highest energy features of the original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by using SCOPE to learn the gait of a hexapod robot. The hexapod controller is given a matrix input containing time-series information of previous poses, which are then transformed to gait parameters by an evolved policy. In this task, the addition of SCOPE to a reference algorithm achieves a 20% increase in efficacy. SCOPE achieves this result by reducing the total input size of the time-series pose data from 2700 to 54, a 98% decrease. Additionally, SCOPE is capable of compressing an input to any output shape, provided that each output dimension is no greater than the corresponding input dimension. This paper demonstrates that SCOPE is capable of significantly compressing the size of an input to an evolved controller, resulting in a statistically significant gain in efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>IJCCI...</summary><p>IJCCI Conference on Evolutionary Computation and Theory and Applications, 2025</p></details> |

Recent LiDAR scene flow models utilize the rigid-motion assumption at the instance level, assuming objects are rigid bodies. However, these instance-level methods are not suitable for sparse radar point clouds. In this work, we present a novel Traffic-Aware Radar Scene-Flow (TARS) estimation method, which utilizes motion rigidity at the traffic level. To address the challenges in radar scene flow, we perform object detection and scene flow jointly and boost the latter. We incorporate the feature map from the object detector, trained with detection losses, to make radar scene flow aware of the environment and road users. From this, we construct a Traffic Vector Field (TVF) in the feature space to achieve holistic traffic-level scene understanding in our scene flow branch. When estimating the scene flow, we consider both point-level motion cues from point neighbors and traffic-level consistency of rigid motion within the space. TARS outperforms the state of the art on a proprietary dataset and the View-of-Delft dataset, improving the benchmarks by 23% and 15%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task, which aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using limited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task. This framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the Lane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies and distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained lane traffic states. Based on existing research, we designed several baseline models with the potential to solve the FRTI task and conducted extensive experiments on six datasets representing different road conditions to validate the effectiveness of the RoadDiff model in addressing the FRTI task. The relevant datasets and code are available at https://github.com/ShuhaoLii/RoadDiff.</p></details> |  |

The literature has effectively tackled such a problem, mostly with automated planning techniques leveraging the PDDL+ language and solvers. However, such language has limitations when it comes to specifying optimisation statements and computing optimal plans. In this paper, we provide an alternative solution to the traffic signal optimisation problem based on Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP). We devise an encoding in a CASP language, which is then solved by means of clingcon 3, a system extending the well-known ASP solver clingo. We performed experiments on real historical data from the town of Huddersfield in the UK, comparing our approach to the PDDL+ model that obtained the best results for the considered benchmark. The results showed the potential of our approach for tackling the traffic signal optimisation problem and improving the solution quality of the PDDL+ plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP), Proceedings of ICLP 2025</p></details> |

Current approaches often hinge on predefined driver models, objective optimization, or reliance on pre-recorded driving datasets, imposing limitations on their scalability, versatility, and adaptability. In this paper, we introduce TrafficMCTS, an innovative framework that harnesses the synergy of group-based Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and Social Value Orientation (SVO) to engender a multifaceted traffic flow with varying driving styles and cooperative tendencies. Anchored by a closed-loop architecture, our framework enables vehicles to dynamically adapt to their environment in real time, and ensure feasible collision-free trajectories. Through comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, we illuminate the advantages of our approach in terms of computational efficiency, planning success rate, intention completion time, and diversity metrics. Besides, we simulate multiple scenarios to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and highlight its ability to induce diverse social behaviors within the traffic flow. Finally, we validate the scalability of TrafficMCTS by demonstrating its capability to efficiently simulate diverse traffic scenarios involving numerous interacting vehicles within a complex road network, capturing the intricate dynamics of human-like driving behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> |

This includes value elicitation, capability specification, explanation, and adaptive system refinement. We elaborate and apply the concept of Value-Aligned Operational Design Domains (VODDs) to structure autonomy in accordance with contextual value priorities.

| **[Machine Unlearning of Traffic State Estimation and Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17984v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven traffic state estimation and prediction (TSEP) relies heavily on data sources that contain sensitive information. While the abundance of data has fueled significant breakthroughs, particularly in machine learning-based methods, it also raises concerns regarding privacy, cybersecurity, and data freshness. These issues can erode public trust in intelligent transportation systems. Recently, regulations have introduced the "right to be forgotten", allowing users to request the removal of their private data from models. As machine learning models can remember old data, simply removing it from back-end databases is insufficient in such systems. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel learning paradigm for TSEP-Machine Unlearning TSEP-which enables a trained TSEP model to selectively forget privacy-sensitive, poisoned, or outdated data. By empowering models to "unlearn," we aim to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of data-driven traffic TSEP.</p></details> |  |
| **[LSDM: LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model for Service-Level Mobile Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17795v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Service-level mobile traffic prediction for individual users is essential for network efficiency and quality of service enhancement. However, current prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model (LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions, showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in terms of the coefficient of determination. Compared to models of a similar type, such as CSDI, the root mean squared error can be reduced by at least 8.29%.

By explicitly conditioning on surrounding vehicles and road geometry, Ctx2TrajGen generates interaction-aware trajectories aligned with real-world context.

| **[Cross-domain Multi-step Thinking: Zero-shot Fine-grained Traffic Sign Recognition in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01534v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we propose Cross-domain Multi-step Thinking (CdMT) to improve zero-shot fine-grained traffic sign recognition (TSR) performance in the wild. Zero-shot fine-grained TSR in the wild is challenging due to the cross-domain problem between clean template traffic signs and real-world counterparts, and existing approaches particularly struggle with cross-country TSR scenarios, where traffic signs typically differ between countries. The proposed CdMT framework tackles these challenges by leveraging the multi-step reasoning capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs). We introduce context, characteristic, and differential descriptions to design multiple thinking processes for LMMs. Context descriptions, which are enhanced by center coordinate prompt optimization, enable the precise localization of target traffic signs in complex road images and filter irrelevant responses via novel prior traffic sign hypotheses. Characteristic descriptions, which are derived from in-context learning with template traffic signs, bridge cross-domain gaps and enhance fine-grained TSR. Differential descriptions refine the multimodal reasoning ability of LMMs by distinguishing subtle differences among similar signs. CdMT is independent of training data and requires only simple and uniform instructions, enabling it to achieve cross-country TSR. We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and two real-world datasets from different countries. The proposed CdMT framework achieved superior performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods on all five datasets, with recognition accuracies of 0.93, 0.89, 0.97, 0.89, and 0.85 on the GTSRB, BTSD, TT-100K, Sapporo, and Yokohama datasets, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published by Knowledge-Based Systems</p></details> |

All of them promise astonishing performance in encrypted traffic classification (up to 98% accuracy). In this paper, with a networking expert mindset, we critically reassess their performance. Through extensive analysis, we demonstrate that the reported successes are heavily influenced by data preparation problems, which allow these models to find easy shortcuts - spurious correlation between features and labels - during fine-tuning that unrealistically boost their performance. When such shortcuts are not present - as in real scenarios - these models perform poorly. We also introduce Pcap-Encoder, an LM-based representation learning model that we specifically design to extract features from protocol headers. Pcap-Encoder appears to be the only model that provides an instrumental representation for traffic classification. Yet, its complexity questions its applicability in practical settings. Our findings reveal flaws in dataset preparation and model training, calling for a better and more conscious test design.

To address this growing concern, we introduce Beacon, a naturalistic driving dataset capturing traffic dynamics during blackouts at two major intersections in Memphis, TN, USA. The dataset provides detailed traffic movements, including timesteps, origin, and destination lanes for each vehicle over four hours of peak periods. We analyze traffic demand, vehicle trajectories, and density across different scenarios, demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction under unsignalized, signalized, and mixed traffic conditions. We find that integrating robot vehicles (RVs) into traffic flow can substantially reduce intersection delays, with wait time improvements of up to 82.6%. However, this enhanced traffic efficiency comes with varying environmental impacts, as decreased vehicle idling may lead to higher overall CO2 emissions. To the best of our knowledge, Beacon is the first publicly available traffic dataset for naturalistic driving behaviors during blackouts at intersections.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2025</p></details> |

This study explores how robot vehicles (RVs) can enhance heterogeneous traffic flow, particularly at unsignalized intersections where traditional methods fail during power outages. Using reinforcement learning (RL) and real-world data, we simulate mixed traffic at complex intersections with RV penetration rates ranging from 10% to 90%. Results show that average waiting times drop by up to 86% and 91% compared to signalized and unsignalized intersections, respectively. We observe a "rarity advantage," where less frequent vehicles benefit the most (up to 87%). Although CO2 emissions and fuel consumption increase with RV penetration, they remain well below those of traditional signalized traffic. Decreased space headways also indicate more efficient road usage. These findings highlight RVs' potential to improve traffic efficiency and reduce environmental impact in complex, heterogeneous settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2025</p></details> |

This study addresses binary VPN detection, distinguishing VPN-encrypted from non-VPN traffic using wavelet transform-based features across multiple machine learning models. Unlike previous studies focused on application-level classification within encrypted traffic, we specifically evaluate the fundamental task of VPN identification regardless of application type. We analyze the impact of wavelet decomposition levels and dataset filtering on classification performance across significantly imbalanced data, where filtering reduces some traffic categories by up to 95%. Our results demonstrate that Random Forest (RF) achieves superior performance with an F1-score of 99%, maintaining robust accuracy even after significant dataset filtering. Neural Networks (NN) show comparable effectiveness with an F1-score of 98% when trained on wavelet level 12, while Support Vector Machines (SVM) exhibit notable sensitivity to dataset reduction, with F1-scores dropping from 90% to 85% after filtering. Comparing wavelet decomposition at levels 5 and 12, we observe improved classification performance at level 12, particularly for variable traffic types, though the marginal gains may not justify the additional computational overhead. These findings establish RF as the most reliable model for VPN traffic classification while highlighting key performance tradeoffs in feature extraction and preprocessing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at SoftCOM 2025</p></details> |

Given that ST data comprises non-stationary and complex temporal patterns, interpreting and predicting such trends is inherently challenging. Representing ST data in decomposed modes helps infer underlying behavior and assess the impact of noise on predictive performance. We propose a framework that decomposes ST data into interpretable modes using variational mode decomposition (VMD) and processes them through a neural network for future state forecasting. Unlike existing graph-based traffic forecasters that operate directly on raw or aggregated time series, the proposed hybrid approach, termed the Variational Mode Graph Convolutional Network (VMGCN), first decomposes non-stationary signals into interpretable variational modes by determining the optimal mode count via reconstruction-loss minimization and then learns both intramode and cross-mode spatiotemporal dependencies through a novel attention-augmented GCN. Additionally, we analyze the significance of each mode and the effect of bandwidth constraints on multi-horizon traffic flow predictions. The proposed two-stage design yields significant accuracy gains while providing frequency-level interpretability with demonstrated superior performance on the LargeST dataset for both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks. The implementation is publicly available on https://github.com/OsamaAhmad369/VMGCN.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM T...</summary><p>ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST) Submission, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Joint-Local Grounded Action Transformation for Sim-to-Real Transfer in Multi-Agent Traffic Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15174v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is essential for managing urban traffic flow and reducing congestion. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers an adaptive method for TSC by responding to dynamic traffic patterns, with multi-agent RL (MARL) gaining traction as intersections naturally function as coordinated agents. However, due to shifts in environmental dynamics, implementing MARL-based TSC policies in the real world often leads to a significant performance drop, known as the sim-to-real gap. Grounded Action Transformation (GAT) has successfully mitigated this gap in single-agent RL for TSC, but real-world traffic networks, which involve numerous interacting intersections, are better suited to a MARL framework. In this work, we introduce JL-GAT, an application of GAT to MARL-based TSC that balances scalability with enhanced grounding capability by incorporating information from neighboring agents. JL-GAT adopts a decentralized approach to GAT, allowing for the scalability often required in real-world traffic networks while still capturing key interactions between agents. Comprehensive experiments on various road networks under simulated adverse weather conditions, along with ablation studies, demonstrate the effectiveness of JL-GAT. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/DaRL-LibSignal/JL-GAT/.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted to RLC/RLJ 2025</p></details> |

With the cellular traffic demand increasing so dramatically, it is now necessary to accurately predict the user traffic in cellular networks, so as to improve the performance in terms of resource allocation and utilisation. Since traffic learning and prediction is a classical and appealing field, which still yields many meaningful results, there has been an increasing interest in leveraging Machine Learning tools to analyse the total traffic served in a given region, to optimise the operation of the network. With the help of this project, we seek to exploit the traffic history by using it to predict the nature and occurrence of future traffic. Furthermore, we classify the traffic into particular application types, to increase our understanding of the nature of the traffic. By leveraging the power of machine learning and identifying its usefulness in the field of cellular networks we try to achieve three main objectives - classification of the application generating the traffic, prediction of packet arrival intensity and burst occurrence. The design of the prediction and classification system is done using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model. The LSTM predictor developed in this experiment would return the number of uplink packets and also estimate the probability of burst occurrence in the specified future time interval. For the purpose of classification, the regression layer in our LSTM prediction model is replaced by a softmax classifier which is used to classify the application generating the cellular traffic into one of the four applications including surfing, video calling, voice calling, and video streaming.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |

Recent empirical approaches for analyzing traffic patterns have gained traction due to their applicability to city-scale policy development. However, conventional methodologies often rely on fragmented grid-based techniques, which may overlook critical interdependencies among spatial elements and temporal continuity. These limitations can compromise analytical effectiveness in complex urban environments. To address these challenges, we propose PriorMotion, a data integration framework designed to systematically uncover movement patterns through driving dynamics analysis. Our approach combines multi-scale empirical observations with customized analytical tools to capture evolving spatial-temporal trends in urban traffic. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PriorMotion significantly enhances analytical outcomes, including increased accuracy in traffic pattern analysis, improved adaptability to heterogeneous data environments, and reduced long-term projection errors. Validation confirms its effectiveness for urban infrastructure management applications requiring precise characterization of complex spatial-temporal interactions.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

Deep learning has advanced video-based traffic monitoring through video question answering (VideoQA) models, enabling structured insight extraction from traffic videos. However, existing VideoQA models struggle with the complexity of real-world traffic scenes, where multiple concurrent events unfold across spatiotemporal dimensions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \textbf{InterAct VideoQA}, a curated dataset designed to benchmark and enhance VideoQA models for traffic monitoring tasks. The InterAct VideoQA dataset comprises 8 hours of real-world traffic footage collected from diverse intersections, segmented into 10-second video clips, with over 25,000 question-answer (QA) pairs covering spatiotemporal dynamics, vehicle interactions, incident detection, and other critical traffic attributes. State-of-the-art VideoQA models are evaluated on InterAct VideoQA, exposing challenges in reasoning over fine-grained spatiotemporal dependencies within complex traffic scenarios. Additionally, fine-tuning these models on InterAct VideoQA yields notable performance improvements, demonstrating the necessity of domain-specific datasets for VideoQA. InterAct VideoQA is publicly available as a benchmark dataset to facilitate future research in real-world deployable VideoQA models for intelligent transportation systems.

This paper proposes Fourier Domain Adaptation (FDA), which requires only training data modifications without architectural changes, enabling effective adaptation to rainy and foggy conditions. FDA minimizes the domain gap between source and target domains, creating a dataset for reliable performance under adverse weather. The source domain merged LISA and S2TLD datasets, processed to address class imbalance. Established methods simulated rainy and foggy scenarios to form the target domain. Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) techniques were explored to leverage data more effectively, addressing the shortage of comprehensive datasets and poor performance of state-of-the-art models under hostile weather. Experimental results show FDA-augmented models outperform baseline models across mAP50, mAP50-95, Precision, and Recall metrics. YOLOv8 achieved a 12.25% average increase across all metrics. Average improvements of 7.69% in Precision, 19.91% in Recall, 15.85% in mAP50, and 23.81% in mAP50-95 were observed across all models, demonstrating FDA's effectiveness in mitigating adverse weather impact. These improvements enable real-world applications requiring reliable performance in challenging environmental conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2COOOL Workshop, ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, the traditional methods rely on standard graph structures often fail to capture the intricate higher-order spatio-temporal correlations inherent in real-world traffic dynamics. Standard graphs cannot fully represent the spatial relationships within road networks, which limits the effectiveness of graph-based approaches. In contrast, directed hypergraphs provide more accurate representation of spatial information to model complex directed relationships among multiple nodes. In this paper, we propose DHLight, a novel multi-agent policy-based framework that synergistically integrates directed hypergraph learning module. This framework introduces a novel dynamic directed hypergraph construction mechanism, which captures complex and evolving spatio-temporal relationships among intersections in road networks. By leveraging the directed hypergraph relational structure, DHLight empowers agents to achieve adaptive decision-making in traffic signal control. The effectiveness of DHLight is validated against state-of-the-art baselines through extensive experiments in various network datasets. We release the code to support the reproducibility of this work at https://github.com/LuckyVoasem/Traffic-Light-control</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2025)</p></details> |

Relying solely on real-world driving scenes requires collecting massive datasets to capture these scenarios. While automatic generation of traffic scenarios appears promising, data-driven models require extensive training data and often lack fine-grained control over the output. Moreover, generating novel scenarios from scratch can introduce a distributional shift from the original training scenes which undermines the validity of evaluations especially for learning-based planners. To sidestep this, recent work proposes to generate challenging scenarios by augmenting original scenarios from the test set. However, this involves the manual augmentation of scenarios by domain experts. An approach that is unable to meet the demands for scale in the evaluation of self-driving systems. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel LLM-agent based framework for augmenting real-world traffic scenarios using natural language descriptions, addressing the limitations of existing methods. A key innovation is the use of an agentic design, enabling fine-grained control over the output and maintaining high performance even with smaller, cost-effective LLMs. Extensive human expert evaluation demonstrates our framework's ability to accurately adhere to user intent, generating high quality augmented scenarios comparable to those created manually.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we propose GraphTrafficGPT, a novel graph-based architecture, which fundamentally redesigns the task coordination process for LLM-driven traffic applications. GraphTrafficGPT represents tasks and their dependencies as nodes and edges in a directed graph, enabling efficient parallel execution and dynamic resource allocation. The main idea behind the proposed model is a Brain Agent that decomposes user queries, constructs optimized dependency graphs, and coordinates a network of specialized agents for data retrieval, analysis, visualization, and simulation. By introducing advanced context-aware token management and supporting concurrent multi-query processing, the proposed architecture handles interdependent tasks typical of modern urban mobility environments. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphTrafficGPT reduces token consumption by 50.2% and average response latency by 19.0% compared to TrafficGPT, while supporting simultaneous multi-query execution with up to 23.0% improvement in efficiency.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces an interpretable Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework to address this gap. Our attention-based model predicts the number of upcoming clearances, the instructions issued to aircraft by ATCOs, from interactions within static traffic scenarios. Crucially, we derive an interpretable, per-aircraft task demand score by systematically ablating aircraft and measuring the impact on the model's predictions. Our framework significantly outperforms an ATCO-inspired heuristic and is a more reliable estimator of scenario complexity than established baselines. The resulting tool can attribute task demand to specific aircraft, offering a new way to analyse and understand the drivers of complexity for applications in controller training and airspace redesign.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Author Accepted Manuscript version of paper at the AIAA AVIATION Forum 2025</p></details> |

The research utilized 30-second interval traffic data from California Highway 78 over a five-month period from July to November 2022, analyzing a 7.24 km westbound section connecting "Melrose Dr" and "El-Camino Real" in the San Diego area. The study employed Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms, analyzing data collection intervals ranging from 30 seconds to 15 minutes. Using R^2, MAE, and RMSE as performance metrics, the analysis revealed that both MLR and RF models performed optimally with 10-minute data collection intervals. These findings are expected to contribute to future traffic congestion solutions and efficient traffic management.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, methods such as manual counting, loop detectors, pneumatic road tubes, and camera-based recognition have been used for TMC estimation. Although generally reliable, camera-based TMC estimation is prone to inaccuracies under poor lighting conditions during harsh weather and nighttime. In contrast, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology is gaining popularity in recent times due to reduced costs and its expanding use in 3D object detection, tracking, and related applications. This paper presents the authors' endeavor to develop, deploy and evaluate a dual-LiDAR system at an intersection in the city of Rialto, California, for TMC estimation. The 3D bounding box detections from the two LiDARs are used to classify vehicle counts based on traffic directions, vehicle movements, and vehicle classes. This work discusses the estimated TMC results and provides insights into the observed trends and irregularities. Potential improvements are also discussed that could enhance not only TMC estimation, but also trajectory forecasting and intent prediction at intersections.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 Pag...</summary><p>7 Pages, 8 Figures.

Apart from variation across different content types, e.g., game genres, we discovered time-variability within a clip from second to second, and explored the ramifications for traffic management. We introduced utility as an elegant way to manage resource sharing preferences. Our analysis of resource sharing methods shows that frequent QoE-aware reallocation has significant performance advantages compared to static rate allocation, even in case the latter is based on rich information about long-term average spatial complexity. We have also shown that utility-based resource allocation has clear advantages over methods targeting equal QoE allocation, it increases the average QoE, while it still controls the worst case QoE.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, the ability to anticipate the timing of leaf-fall would offer substantial benefits for rail network operators, enabling the efficient scheduling of such mitigation measures. However, current methodologies for predicting leaf-fall exhibit considerable limitations in terms of scalability and reliability. This study endeavors to devise a prediction system that leverages specialized prediction methods and the latest satellite data sources to generate both scalable and reliable insights into leaf-fall timings. An LSTM network trained on ground-truth leaf-falling data combined with multispectral and meteorological satellite data demonstrated a root-mean-square error of 6.32 days for predicting the start of leaf-fall and 9.31 days for predicting the end of leaf-fall. The model, which improves upon previous work on the topic, offers promising opportunities for the optimization of leaf mitigation measures in the railway industry and the improvement of our understanding of complex ecological systems.</p></details> |  |

Currently, a cooperative control strategy based on connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is a fundamental solution to this problem. While CAVs are not fully widespread, it is necessary to propose a hierarchical cooperative on-ramp merging control (HCOMC) framework for heterogeneous traffic flow on two-lane highways to address this gap. This paper extends longitudinal car-following models based on the intelligent driver model and lateral lane-changing models using the quintic polynomial curve to account for human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs, comprehensively considering human factors and cooperative adaptive cruise control. Besides, this paper proposes a HCOMC framework, consisting of a hierarchical cooperative planning model based on the modified virtual vehicle model, a discretionary lane-changing model based on game theory, and a multi-objective optimization model using the elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to ensure the safe, smooth, and efficient merging process. Then, the performance of our HCOMC is analyzed under different traffic densities and CAV penetration rates through simulation. The findings underscore our HCOMC's pronounced comprehensive advantages in enhancing the safety of group vehicles, stabilizing and expediting merging process, optimizing traffic efficiency, and economizing fuel consumption compared with benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, accepted for IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC) 2025</p></details> |

Existing acceleration strategies, which rely on commercial solvers or deep learning, face scalability issues and struggle with degrading performance or long computational time. Unlike existing algorithms adopting parallel strategies, we propose Sequential Source-Destination Optimization (SSDO), a sequential solver-free algorithm for TE. SSDO decomposes the problem into subproblems, each focused on adjusting the split ratios for a specific source-destination (SD) demand while keeping others fixed. To enhance the efficiency of subproblem optimization, we design a Balanced Binary Search Method (BBSM), which identifies the most balanced split ratios among multiple solutions that minimize Maximum Link Utilization (MLU). SSDO dynamically updates the sequence of SDs based on real-time utilization, which accelerates convergence and enhances solution quality. We evaluate SSDO on Meta DCNs and two wide-area networks. In a Meta topology, SSDO achieves a 65\% and 60\% reduction in normalized MLU compared to TEAL and POP, two state-of-the-art TE acceleration methods, while delivering a $12\times$ speedup over POP. These results demonstrate the superior performance of SSDO in large-scale TE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 23rd USENIX Symposium on Network Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI '26), to be held in Seattle on May 4-6, 2026</p></details> |

The models particularly are based on GraphSAGE, Bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) as well as Multi-Head Attention, together with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BI-LSTM) Multi-Head Attention and BI-LSTM and LSTM models. The chosen models demonstrated great performance to model temporal patterns and detect feature significance. The observed performance are mainly due to the fact that IoT system traffic patterns are both sequential and diverse, leaving a rich set of temporal patterns for the models to learn. Experimental results showed that BERT maintained the best performance. It achieved 99.94% accuracy rate alongside high precision and recall, F1-score and AUC-ROC score of 99.99% which demonstrates its capabilities through temporal dependency capture. The Multi-Head Attention offered promising results by providing good detection capabilities with interpretable results. On the other side, the Multi-Head Attention model required significant processing time like BI-LSTM variants. The GraphSAGE model achieved good accuracy while requiring the shortest training time but yielded the lowest accuracy, precision, and F1 score compared to the other models</p></details> |  |

| **[TGLD: A Trust-Aware Game-Theoretic Lane-Changing Decision Framework for Automated Vehicles in Heterogeneous Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10075v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated vehicles (AVs) face a critical need to adopt socially compatible behaviors and cooperate effectively with human-driven vehicles (HVs) in heterogeneous traffic environment. However, most existing lane-changing frameworks overlook HVs' dynamic trust levels, limiting their ability to accurately predict human driver behaviors. To address this gap, this study proposes a trust-aware game-theoretic lane-changing decision (TGLD) framework. First, we formulate a multi-vehicle coalition game, incorporating fully cooperative interactions among AVs and partially cooperative behaviors from HVs informed by real-time trust evaluations. Second, we develop an online trust evaluation method to dynamically estimate HVs' trust levels during lane-changing interactions, guiding AVs to select context-appropriate cooperative maneuvers. Lastly, social compatibility objectives are considered by minimizing disruption to surrounding vehicles and enhancing the predictability of AV behaviors, thereby ensuring human-friendly and context-adaptive lane-changing strategies. A human-in-the-loop experiment conducted in a highway on-ramp merging scenario validates our TGLD approach. Results show that AVs can effectively adjust strategies according to different HVs' trust levels and driving styles. Moreover, incorporating a trust mechanism significantly improves lane-changing efficiency, maintains safety, and contributes to transparent and adaptive AV-HV interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures, accepted for IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC) 2025</p></details> |

However, acquiring ground-truth SPaT information faces significant hurdles due to communication challenges with transportation departments and signal installers. As a result, Floating Car Data (FCD) has become the primary source for large-scale SPaT analyses. Current FCD approaches often simplify the problem by assuming fixed schedules and basic intersection designs for specific times and locations. These methods fail to account for periodic signal changes, diverse intersection structures, and the inherent limitations of real-world data, thus lacking a comprehensive framework that is universally applicable. Addressing this limitation, we propose an industrial-grade FCD analysis suite that manages the entire process, from initial data preprocessing to final SPaT estimation. Our approach estimates signal phases, identifies time-of-day (TOD) periods, and determines the durations of red and green lights. The framework's notable stability and robustness across diverse conditions, regardless of road geometry, is a key feature. Furthermore, we provide a cleaned, de-identified FCD dataset and supporting parameters to facilitate future research. Currently operational within our navigation platform, the system analyses over 15 million FCD records daily, supporting over two million traffic signals in mainland China, with more than 75\% of estimations demonstrating less than five seconds of error.</p></details> | Accepted by ITSC'25 |

Each region or road segment can be viewed as an individual client that measures local traffic flow, making Federated Learning (FL) a suitable approach for collaboratively training models without sharing raw data. In centralized FL, a central server collects and aggregates model updates from multiple clients to build a shared model while preserving each client's data privacy. Standard FL methods, such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg), assume that clients are independent, which can limit performance in traffic prediction tasks where spatial relationships between clients are important. Federated Graph Learning methods can capture these dependencies during server-side aggregation, but they often introduce significant computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a lightweight graph-aware FL approach that blends the simplicity of FedAvg with key ideas from graph learning. Rather than training full models, our method applies basic neighbourhood aggregation principles to guide parameter updates, weighting client models based on graph connectivity. This approach captures spatial relationships effectively while remaining computationally efficient. We evaluate our method on two benchmark traffic datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, and show that it achieves competitive performance compared to standard baselines and recent graph-based federated learning techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at FedKDD 2025: International Joint Workshop on Federated Learning for Data Mining and Graph Analytics. 6 pages, 1 figure</p></details> |

Although not only accuracy but also efficiency for scalability is important, some previous methods struggle to capture heterogeneity such as varying traffic patterns across regions and time periods. Moreover, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are the mainstream of traffic prediction, not only require predefined adjacency matrix, but also limit scalability to large-scale data containing many nodes due to their inherent complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose Deformable Dynamic Convolution Network (DDCN) for accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. Traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are limited in modeling non-Euclidean spatial structures and spatio-temporal heterogeneity, DDCN overcomes these challenges by dynamically applying deformable filters based on offset. Specifically, DDCN decomposes transformer-style CNN to encoder-decoder structure, and applies proposed approaches to the spatial and spatio-temporal attention blocks of the encoder to emphasize important features. The decoder, composed of feed-forward module, complements the output of the encoder. This novel structure make DDCN can perform accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. In comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets, DDCN achieves competitive performance, emphasizing the potential and effectiveness of CNN-based approaches for spatio-temporal traffic prediction.</p></details> | 7 pages |

Traffic planning experts rely on specialized platforms to simulate traffic systems, assessing the efficacy of the road network across various states of modifications. Nevertheless, a prevailing issue persists: many existing traffic planning platforms exhibit inefficiencies in flexibly interacting with the road network's structure and attributes and intuitively comparing multiple states during the iterative planning process. This paper introduces TraSculptor, an interactive planning decision-making system. To develop TraSculptor, we identify and address two challenges: interactive modification of road networks and intuitive comparison of multiple network states. For the first challenge, we establish flexible interactions to enable experts to easily and directly modify the road network on the map. For the second challenge, we design a comparison view with a history tree of multiple states and a road-state matrix to facilitate intuitive comparison of road network states.

Recent findings in visual perception suggest that foundation models, enabled by advanced pre-training, allow simple yet flexible architectures to outperform specialized designs. Therefore, in this work, we investigate an architecturally simple encoder-only approach using plain Video Vision Transformers (Video ViTs) and study how pre-training enables strong TAD performance. We find that: (i) strong pre-training enables simple encoder-only models to match or even surpass the performance of specialized state-of-the-art TAD methods, while also being significantly more efficient; (ii) although weakly- and fully-supervised pre-training are advantageous on standard benchmarks, we find them less effective for TAD. Instead, self-supervised Masked Video Modeling (MVM) provides the strongest signal; and (iii) Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT) on unlabeled driving videos further improves downstream performance, without requiring anomalous examples. Our findings highlight the importance of pre-training and show that effective, efficient, and scalable TAD models can be built with minimal architectural complexity. We release our code, domain-adapted encoders, and fine-tuned models to support future work: https://github.com/tue-mps/simple-tad.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCVW...</summary><p>ICCVW 2025 accepted.

The SUs can reshape their traffic demands by modifying the semantic extraction factor, while the RIS can reconfigure the channel conditions via the passive beamforming. This provides the AP with greater flexibility to decode the superimposed signals from the SUs. We aim to minimize the system's overall energy consumption, while ensuring that each SU's traffic demand is satisfied. Hence, we formulate a joint optimization problem of the SUs' decoding order and semantic control, as well as the RIS's passive beamforming strategy. This problem is intractable due to the complicated coupling in constraints. To solve this, we decompose the original problem into two subproblems and solve them by using a series of approximate methods. Numerical results show that the joint traffic reshaping and channel reconfiguration scheme significantly improves the energy saving performance of the NOMA transmissions compared to the benchmark methods.</p></details> |  |

We use the Spatiotemporal Generative Adversarial Network (STGAN) framework combining Graph Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks to capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies in traffic data. We apply STGAN to real-time, minute-by-minute observations from 42 traffic cameras across Gothenburg, Sweden, collected over several months in 2020. The images are processed to compute a flow metric representing vehicle density, which serves as input for the model. Training is conducted on data from April to November 2020, and validation is performed on a separate dataset from November 14 to 23, 2020. Our results demonstrate that the model effectively detects traffic anomalies with high precision and low false positive rates. The detected anomalies include camera signal interruptions, visual artifacts, and extreme weather conditions affecting traffic flow.</p></details> |  |

This can induce stress. Detecting stress is a key point in maintaining the high safety standards of ATC. However, processing ATC voice data entails privacy restrictions, e.g. the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) law. Anonymizing the ATC voice data is one way to comply with these restrictions. In this paper, different architectures for stress detection for anonymized ATCO speech are evaluated. Our best networks reach a stress detection accuracy of 93.6% on an anonymized version of the Speech Under Simulated and Actual Stress (SUSAS) dataset and an accuracy of 80.1% on our anonymized ATC simulation dataset. This shows that privacy does not have to be an impediment in building well-performing deep-learning-based models.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables, publication identification number (URN)- urn:nbn:de:101:1-2022122008393409239462, see archived online publication- https://d-nb.info/127614606X/34 & Katalogeintrag: https://d-nb.info/127614606X/</p></details> |

The uniqueness and existence of the entropy solution are proven via doubling of the variables arguments and convergent finite volume approximations, respectively. The primary goal is to establish that the finite volume numerical approximations of the system converge to the unique entropy solution at a rate of $\sqrt{\Delta t}$, even when using relatively less regular one-sided kernels, compared to the globally smooth kernels analyzed in [Num. Math., 156(1):237-271, 2024] and [IMA J. Numer. Anal., 44(6):3354-3392, 2024]. The applicability of the proven theory to a general class of systems of nonlocal balance laws coupled strongly through the convective part and weakly through the source part, is indicated. As the support of the kernel tends to zero, the convergence of the entropy solutions of the proposed model to its local counterparts [SIAM J. Math. Anal., 51: 3694--3713, 2019] is also discussed. Numerical simulations illustrating the behavior of the entropy solutions of the coupled nonlocal systems are also shown.</p></details> |  |

Traffic sign recognition, an essential component of autonomous vehicles, is particularly vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can compromise driving safety. In this paper, we propose an N-version machine learning (NVML) framework that integrates a safety-aware weighted soft voting mechanism. Our approach utilizes Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to assess potential safety risks and assign dynamic, safety-aware weights to the ensemble outputs. We evaluate the robustness of three-version NVML systems employing various voting mechanisms against adversarial samples generated using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks.

However, pervasive missing data caused by sensor failures and heterogeneous sensing gaps fundamentally hinders reliable traffic modeling. This paper proposes a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model that synergizes low-rank tensor algebra with deep representation learning for robust traffic data imputation. The model innovatively embeds CP decomposition into neural architecture through learnable embedding projections, where sparse traffic tensors are encoded into dense latent factors across road segments, time intervals, and mobility metrics. A hierarchical feature fusion mechanism employs Hadamard products to explicitly model multilinear interactions, while stacked multilayer perceptron layers nonlinearly refine these representations to capture complex spatiotemporal couplings. Extensive evaluations on six urban traffic datasets demonstrate NCPF's superiority over six state-of-the-art baselines. By unifying CP decomposition's interpretable factor analysis with neural network's nonlinear expressive power, NCPF provides a principled yet flexible approaches for high-dimensional traffic data imputation, offering critical support for next-generation transportation digital twins and adaptive traffic control systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing state-of-the-art solutions often fail to meet the required level of protection against linkage attacks and demographic biases, leading to privacy leakage and inequity in data analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm designed to address the challenges regarding the balance of privacy, utility, and fairness in location-based vehicular traffic management systems. In this context, utility means providing reliable and meaningful traffic information, while fairness ensures that all regions and individuals are treated equitably in data use and decision-making. Employing differential privacy techniques, we enhance data security by integrating query-based data access with iterative shuffling and calibrated noise injection, ensuring that sensitive geographical data remains protected. We ensure adherence to epsilon-differential privacy standards by implementing the Laplace mechanism. We implemented our algorithm on vehicular location-based data from Norway, demonstrating its ability to maintain data utility for traffic management and urban planning while ensuring fair representation of all geographical areas without being overrepresented or underrepresented. Additionally, we have created a heatmap of Norway based on our model, illustrating the privatized and fair representation of the traffic conditions across various cities.

Without relying on simulation, we derive a series of coupled delay differential equations to model vehicular interactions. By introducing a mnemonic-based symbolic system, we establish a mathematical framework incorporating stochastic initial conditions, non-uniform reaction times, and cognitive lag. A full linear stability analysis is conducted using Fourier decomposition and modal perturbation techniques. Our results identify critical thresholds for harmonic induction, delineate the bounds of safe following distances, and reveal hysteresis in driver overcorrection. The analysis concludes with implications for autonomous vehicle control and potential suppression strategies for oscillatory instability. All derivations are purely symbolic and analytically proven.</p></details> | 79 pages |

Using a novel network algorithm and Mexican census data from 2005 to 2020, we first quantify changes in the strength of domestic and international migration networks across all Mexican municipalities. We exploit variation in local homicide rates, using exogenous fuel price increases and municipalities' proximity to oil pipelines as instruments, to estimate the causal impact of violence on migration. During our study period, following intensified government crackdowns on drug trafficking organizations, many criminal groups fragmented and turned toward large-scale oil theft, driving sharp increases in violence in areas with oil pipelines, particularly when fuel prices rose. The findings show that rising violence increased emigration flows, predominantly within Mexico, and strengthened the intensity of emigration networks both domestically and toward the United States. Although violent municipalities continued to receive new residents, the rise in emigration was larger. Increasing homicide rates led to at least an additional 1.12 million people emigrating domestically and 50,200 fewer Mexicans returning from the United States. Violence also eroded regional connectivity, causing a long-term decline in daily vehicle traffic on highways linking violent areas to the rest of the country.</p></details> |  |

The proposed approach leverages a bird's-eye view video processing pipeline and zero-shot VLM capabilities to obtain structured information about surrounding vehicles, including their positions, dimensions, and velocities. Using this rich perception output, we construct elliptical collision-avoidance potential fields around other traffic participants, which are seamlessly integrated into a finite-horizon optimal control problem for trajectory planning. The resulting trajectory optimization is solved via differential dynamic programming with an adaptive regularization scheme and is embedded in an event-triggered MPC loop. To ensure collision-free motion, a safety verification layer is incorporated in the framework that provides an assessment of potential unsafe trajectories. Extensive simulations in Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) demonstrate that VisioPath outperforms conventional MPC baselines across multiple metrics. By combining modern AI-driven perception with the rigorous foundation of optimal control, VisioPath represents a significant step forward in safe trajectory planning for complex traffic systems.</p></details> |  |

To clarify this problem, we take three prior solutions presented for different but similar traffic classification and website fingerprinting tasks, and apply each solution's model to another solution's dataset. We pinpoint dataset-specific and model-specific properties that lead each of them to overperform in their specific evaluation context. As a realistic evaluation context that takes practical labeling constraints into account, we design an evaluation framework using two recent real-world TLS traffic datasets from large-scale networks. The framework simulates a futuristic scenario in which SNIs are hidden in some networks but not in others, and the classifier's goal is to predict destination services in one network's traffic, having been trained on a labelled dataset collected from a different network. Our framework has the distinction of including real-world distribution shift, while excluding concept drift. We show that, even when abundant labeled data is available, the best solutions' performances under distribution shift are between 30% and 40%, and a simple 1-Nearest Neighbor classifier's performance is not far behind. We depict all performances measured on different models, not just the best ones, for a fair representation of traffic models in practice.</p></details> |  |

There is an urgent need to ensure the reliability and robustness of autonomous driving systems (ADSs). Despite the recent achievements in testing various ADS modules, little attention has been paid on the automated testing of traffic light detection models in ADSs. A common practice is to manually collect and label traffic light data. However, it is labor-intensive, and even impossible to collect diverse data under different driving environments. To address these problems, we propose and implement TigAug to automatically augment labeled traffic light images for testing traffic light detection models in ADSs. We construct two families of metamorphic relations and three families of transformations based on a systematic understanding of weather environments, camera properties, and traffic light properties. We use augmented images to detect erroneous behaviors of traffic light detection models by transformation-specific metamorphic relations, and to improve the performance of traffic light detection models by retraining. Large-scale experiments with four state-of-the-art traffic light detection models and two traffic light datasets have demonstrated that i) TigAug is effective in testing traffic light detection models, ii) TigAug is efficient in synthesizing traffic light images, and iii) TigAug generates traffic light images with acceptable naturalness.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we propose a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for managing large-scale mixed traffic networks, where intersections are controlled either by traditional traffic signals or by robotic vehicles. We evaluate our approach on a real-world network of 14 intersections in Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA, using average vehicle waiting time as the primary measure of traffic efficiency.

| **[A Distributed Consensus Algorithm for Prioritizing Autonomous Vehicle Passing at Unsignalized Intersections under Mixed Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03486v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a methodology for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to determine their passing priority at unsignalized intersections where they coexist with human-driven vehicles (HVs). Assuming that CAVs can perceive the entry order of surrounding vehicles using computer vision technology and are capable of avoiding collisions, we introduce a voting-based distributed consensus algorithm inspired by Raft to resolve tie-breaking among simultaneously arriving CAVs. The algorithm is structured around the candidate and leader election processes and incorporates a minimal consensus quorum to ensure both safety and liveness among CAVs under typical asynchronous communication conditions. Assuming CAVs to be SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) Level-4 or higher autonomous vehicles, we implemented the proposed distributed consensus algorithm using gRPC. By adjusting variables such as the CAV-to-HV ratio, intersection scale, and the processing time of computer vision modules, we demonstrated that stable consensus can be achieved even under mixed-traffic conditions involving HVs without adequate functionalities to interact with CAVs. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm reached consensus at a typical unsignalized four-way, two-lane intersection in approximately 30-40 ms on average. A secondary vision-based system is employed to complete the crossing priorities based on the recognized lexicographical order of the license plate numbers in case the consensus procedure times out on an unreliable vehicle-to-vehicle communication network. The significance of this study lies in its ability to improve traffic flow at unsignalized intersections by enabling rapid determination of passing priority through distributed consensus even under mixed traffic with faulty vehicles.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[On the Robotic Uncertainty of Fully Autonomous Traffic: From Stochastic Car-Following to Mobility-Safety Trade-Offs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12611v3)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent transportation research highlights the potential of autonomous vehicles (AV) to improve traffic flow mobility as they are able to maintain smaller car-following distances. However, as a unique class of ground robots, AVs are susceptible to robotic errors, particularly in their perception and control modules with imperfect sensors and actuators, leading to uncertainties in their movements and an increased risk of collisions. Consequently, conservative operational strategies, such as larger headway and slower speeds, are implemented to prioritize safety over mobility in real-world operations. To reconcile the inconsistency, this paper presents an analytical model framework that delineates the endogenous reciprocity between traffic safety and mobility that arises from AVs' robotic uncertainties. Using both realistic car-following data and a stochastic intelligent driving model (IDM), the stochastic car-following distance is derived as a key parameter, enabling analysis of single-lane capacity and collision probability. A semi-Markov process is then employed to model the dynamics of the lane capacity, and the resulting collision-inclusive capacity, representing expected lane capacity under stationary conditions, serves as the primary performance metric for fully autonomous traffic. The analytical results are further utilized to investigate the impacts of critical parameters in AV and roadway designs on traffic performance, as well as the properties of optimal speed and headway under mobility-targeted or safety-dominated management objectives. Extensions to scenarios involving multiple non-independent collisions or multi-lane traffic scenarios are also discussed, which demonstrates the robustness of the theoretical results and their practical applications.</p></details> |  |

However, finding a manageable and finite, yet representative subset of scenarios in a scalable, possibly unsupervised manner is notoriously challenging. Our work is meant to constitute a cornerstone to facilitate sample-efficient testing, while still capturing the diversity of relevant operational design domains (ODDs) and accounting for the "long tail" phenomenon in particular. To this end, we first propose an expressive and flexible heterogeneous, spatio-temporal graph model for representing traffic scenarios. Leveraging recent advances of graph neural networks (GNNs), we then propose a self-supervised method to learn a universal embedding space for scenario graphs that enables clustering and similarity search. In particular, we implement contrastive learning alongside a bootstrapping-based approach and evaluate their suitability for partitioning the scenario space. Experiments on the nuPlan dataset confirm the model's ability to capture semantics and thus group related scenarios in a meaningful way despite the absence of discrete class labels. Different scenario types materialize as distinct clusters. Our results demonstrate how variable-length traffic scenarios can be condensed into single vector representations that enable nearest-neighbor retrieval of representative candidates for distinct scenario categories. Notably, this is achieved without manual labeling or bias towards an explicit objective such as criticality. Ultimately, our approach can serve as a basis for scalable selection of scenarios to further enhance the efficiency and robustness of testing AVs in simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted in the IEEE IAVVC 2025 conference</p></details> |

This leads to challenges in achieving timing predictability techniques due to access contention on shared resources, which can be mitigated using hardware-based spatial and temporal isolation techniques. Focusing on the interconnect as the point of access for shared resources, we propose AXI-REALM, a lightweight, modular, technology-independent, and open-source real-time extension to AXI4 interconnects. AXI-REALM uses a budget-based mechanism enforced on periodic time windows and transfer fragmentation to provide fair arbitration, coupled with execution predictability on real-time workloads. AXI-REALM features a comprehensive bandwidth and latency monitor at both the ingress and egress of the interconnect system. Latency information is also used to detect and reset malfunctioning subordinates, preventing missed deadlines. We provide a detailed cost assessment in a 12 nm node and an end-to-end case study implementing AXI-REALM into an open-source MCS, incurring an area overhead of less than 2%. When running a mixed-criticality workload, with a time-critical application sharing the interconnect with non-critical applications, we demonstrate that the critical application can achieve up to 68.2% of the isolated performance by enforcing fairness on the interconnect traffic through burst fragmentation, thus reducing the subordinate access latency by up to 24 times. Near-ideal performance, (above 95% of the isolated performance) can be achieved by distributing the available bandwidth in favor of the critical application.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 13 figures, 3 tables, accepted as a regular paper in IEEE Transactions on Computers</p></details> |

We propose a fully LLM-based solution that predicts the incident impact using a combination of traffic features and LLM-extracted incident features. A key ingredient of this solution is an effective method of selecting examples for the LLM's in-context learning. We evaluate the performance of three advanced LLMs and two state-of-the-art machine learning models on a real traffic incident dataset.

In contrast to incorporating external factors, we propose to learn the processes underlying cellular load generation by employing population dynamics data. In this study, we focus on smart roads and use road traffic measures to improve prediction accuracy. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that by employing road flow and speed, in addition to cellular network metrics, base station load prediction errors can be substantially reduced, by as much as $56.5\%.$ The code, visualizations and extensive results are available on https://github.com/nvassileva/DataMatters.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, forecasting is challenging due to the combined effects of dynamic road conditions, varying traffic patterns across different locations, and external influences such as weather and accidents. Traffic data often consists of several interrelated measurements - such as speed, flow and occupancy - yet many deep-learning approaches either predict only one of these variables or require a separate model for each. This limits their ability to capture joint patterns across channels. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Channel Spatio-Temporal (MCST) Mamba model, a forecasting framework built on the Mamba selective state-space architecture that natively handles multivariate inputs and simultaneously models all traffic features. The proposed MCST-Mamba model integrates adaptive spatio-temporal embeddings and separates the modeling of temporal sequences and spatial sensor interactions into two dedicated Mamba blocks, improving representation learning. Unlike prior methods that evaluate on a single channel, we assess MCST-Mamba across all traffic features at once, aligning more closely with how congestion arises in practice. Our results show that MCST-Mamba achieves strong predictive performance with a lower parameter count compared to baseline models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Communications Software and Multimedia track of the 2025 IEEE Global Communications Conference</p></details> |

With the popularity of devices, related security and privacy risks arise at the same time as they collect user-related data and transmit it to various service providers. Although China accounts for a larger share of the consumer IoT industry, current analyses on consumer IoT device traffic primarily focus on regions such as Europe, the United States, and Australia. Research on China, however, is currently relatively rare. This study constructs the first large-scale dataset about consumer IoT device traffic in China. Specifically, we propose a fine-grained traffic collection guidance covering the entire lifecycle of consumer IoT devices, gathering traffic from 77 devices spanning 38 brands and 12 device categories. Based on this dataset, we analyze traffic destinations and encryption practices across different device types during the entire lifecycle and compare the findings with the results of other regions. Compared to other regions, our results show that consumer IoT devices in China rely more on domestic services and overall perform better in terms of encryption practices. However, there are still 23/40 devices improperly conducting certificate validation, and 2/70 devices use insecure encryption protocols. To facilitate future research, we open-source our traffic collection guidance and make our dataset publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chat2SPaT: A Large Language Model Based Tool for Automating Traffic Signal Control Plan Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05283v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-timed traffic signal control, commonly used for operating signalized intersections and coordinated arterials, requires tedious manual work for signaling plan creating and updating. When the time-of-day or day-of-week plans are utilized, one intersection is often associated with multiple plans, leading to further repetitive manual plan parameter inputting. To enable a user-friendly traffic signal control plan management process, this study proposes Chat2SPaT, a method to convert users' semi-structured and ambiguous descriptions on the signal control plan to exact signal phase and timing (SPaT) results, which could further be transformed into structured stage-based or ring-based plans to interact with intelligent transportation system (ITS) software and traffic signal controllers. With curated prompts, Chat2SPaT first leverages large language models' (LLMs) capability of understanding users' plan descriptions and reformulate the plan as a combination of phase sequence and phase attribute results in the json format. Based on LLM outputs, python scripts are designed to locate phases in a cycle, address nuances of traffic signal control, and finally assemble the complete traffic signal control plan. Within a chat, the pipeline can be utilized iteratively to conduct further plan editing.

Existing machine learning models often rely only on a single representation of packets or flows, limiting their ability to capture the contextual relationships essential for robust analysis. Furthermore, task-specific architectures for supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning lead to inefficiencies in adapting to varying data formats and security tasks. To address these gaps, we propose UniNet, a unified framework that introduces a novel multi-granular traffic representation (T-Matrix), integrating session, flow, and packet-level features to provide comprehensive contextual information. Combined with T-Attent, a lightweight attention-based model, UniNet efficiently learns latent embeddings for diverse security tasks. Extensive evaluations across four key network security and privacy problems--anomaly detection, attack classification, IoT device identification, and encrypted website fingerprinting--demonstrate UniNet's significant performance gain over state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher accuracy, lower false positive rates, and improved scalability. By addressing the limitations of single-level models and unifying traffic analysis paradigms, UniNet sets a new benchmark for modern network security.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages,6 figures, 12 tables; accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking, 2025</p></details> |

Communication between nodes can be observed by network level attackers as it inherently takes place in the open. Despite online services increasingly using encrypted traffic, the shape of the traffic is not hidden. To prevent traffic analysis, the shape of a system's traffic must be independent of secrets. We investigate adapting the data-oblivious approach the reactive setting and present OblivIO, a secure language for writing reactive programs driven by network events. Our approach pads with dummy messages to hide which program sends are genuinely executed. We use an information-flow type system to provably enforce timing-sensitive noninterference. The type system is extended with potentials to bound the overhead in traffic introduced by our approach. We address challenges that arise from joining data-oblivious and reactive programming and demonstrate the feasibility of our resulting language by developing an interpreter that implements security critical operations as constant-time algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 16 figures, Technical report for paper submitted to CSF 2023</p></details> |
| **[EP-Diffuser: An Efficient Diffusion Model for Traffic Scene Generation and Prediction via Polynomial Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05422v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the prediction horizon increases, predicting the future evolution of traffic scenes becomes increasingly difficult due to the multi-modal nature of agent motion. Most state-of-the-art (SotA) prediction models primarily focus on forecasting the most likely future. However, for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles, it is equally important to cover the distribution for plausible motion alternatives. To address this, we introduce EP-Diffuser, a novel parameter-efficient diffusion-based generative model designed to capture the distribution of possible traffic scene evolutions. Conditioned on road layout and agent history, our model acts as a predictor and generates diverse, plausible scene continuations. We benchmark EP-Diffuser against two SotA models in terms of accuracy and plausibility of predictions on the Argoverse 2 dataset. Despite its significantly smaller model size, our approach achieves both highly accurate and plausible traffic scene predictions. We further evaluate model generalization ability in an out-of-distribution (OoD) test setting using Waymo Open dataset and show superior robustness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Traffic Signal Control based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. Case Study on a simulated real-world corridor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02189v4)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous studies that have formulated multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for adaptive traffic signal control have primarily used value-based RL methods. However, recent literature has shown that policy-based methods may perform better in partially observable environments. Additionally, RL methods remain largely untested for real-world normally signal timing plans because of the simplifying assumptions common in the literature. The current study attempts to address these gaps and formulates a multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MA-PPO) algorithm to implement adaptive and coordinated traffic control along an arterial corridor. The formulated MA-PPO has a centralized-critic architecture under a centralized training and decentralized execution framework. Agents are designed to allow selection and implementation of up to eight signal phases, as commonly implemented in field controllers. The formulated algorithm is tested on a simulated real-world seven intersection corridor. The speed of convergence for each agent was found to depend on the size of the action space, which depends on the number and sequence of signal phases. The performance of the formulated MA-PPO adaptive control algorithm is compared with the field implemented actuated-coordinated signal control (ASC), modeled using PTV-Vissim-MaxTime software in the loop simulation (SILs). The trained MA-PPO performed significantly better than the ASC for all movements. Compared to ASC the MA-PPO showed 2% and 24% improvements in travel time in the primary and secondary coordination directions, respectively. For cross streets movements MA-PPO also showed significant crossing time reductions. Volume sensitivity experiments revealed that the formulated MA-PPO demonstrated good stability, robustness, and adaptability to changes in traffic demand.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the impact of coordinated fleets size on traffic efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15742v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate a traffic assignment problem on a transportation network, considering both the demands of individual drivers and of a large fleet controlled by a central operator (minimizing the fleet's average travel time). We formulate this problem as a two-player convex game and we study how the size of the coordinated fleet, measured in terms of share of the total demand, influences the Price of Anarchy (PoA). We show that, for two-terminal networks, there are cases in which the fleet must reach a minimum share before actually affecting the PoA, which otherwise remains unchanged. Moreover, for parallel networks we prove that, under suitable assumptions, the PoA is monotonically non-increasing in the fleet share.</p></details> |  |
| **[MamNet: A Novel Hybrid Model for Time-Series Forecasting and Frequency Pattern Analysis in Network Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00304v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The abnormal fluctuations in network traffic may indicate potential security threats or system failures. Therefore, efficient network traffic prediction and anomaly detection methods are crucial for network security and traffic management. This paper proposes a novel network traffic prediction and anomaly detection model, MamNet, which integrates time-domain modeling and frequency-domain feature extraction. The model first captures the long-term dependencies of network traffic through the Mamba module (time-domain modeling), and then identifies periodic fluctuations in the traffic using Fourier Transform (frequency-domain feature extraction). In the feature fusion layer, multi-scale information is integrated to enhance the model's ability to detect network traffic anomalies. Experiments conducted on the UNSW-NB15 and CAIDA datasets demonstrate that MamNet outperforms several recent mainstream models in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1-Score. Specifically, it achieves an improvement of approximately 2% to 4% in detection performance for complex traffic patterns and long-term trend detection. The results indicate that MamNet effectively captures anomalies in network traffic across different time scales and is suitable for anomaly detection tasks in network security and traffic management. Future work could further optimize the model structure by incorporating external network event information, thereby improving the model's adaptability and stability in complex network environments.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Geminet: Learning the Duality-based Iterative Process for Lightweight Traffic Engineering in Changing Topologies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23640v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, researchers have explored ML-based Traffic Engineering (TE), leveraging neural networks to solve TE problems traditionally addressed by optimization. However, existing ML-based TE schemes remain impractical: they either fail to handle topology changes or suffer from poor scalability due to excessive computational and memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose Geminet, a lightweight and scalable ML-based TE framework that can handle changing topologies. Geminet is built upon two key insights: (i) a methodology that decouples neural networks from topology by learning an iterative gradient-descent-based adjustment process, as the update rule of gradient descent is topology-agnostic, relying only on a few gradient-related quantities; (ii) shifting optimization from path-level routing weights to edge-level dual variables, reducing memory consumption by leveraging the fact that edges are far fewer than paths. Evaluations on WAN and data center datasets show that Geminet significantly improves scalability. Its neural network size is only 0.04% to 7% of existing schemes, while handling topology variations as effectively as HARP, a state-of-the-art ML-based TE approach, without performance degradation. When trained on large-scale topologies, Geminet consumes under 10 GiB of memory, more than eight times less than the 80-plus GiB required by HARP, while achieving 5.45 times faster convergence speed, demonstrating its potential for large-scale deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Central-Upwind Scheme for the Phase-Transition Traffic Flow Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12153v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Phase-transition models are an important family of non-equilibrium continuum traffic flow models, offering properties like replicating complex traffic phenomena, maintaining anisotropy, and promising potentials for accommodating automated vehicles. However, their complex mathematical characteristics such as discontinuous solution domains, pose numerical challenges and limit their exploration in traffic flow theory. This paper focuses on developing a robust and accurate numerical method for phase-transition traffic flow models: We propose a second-order semi-discrete central-upwind scheme specifically designed for discontinuous phase-transition models. This novel scheme incorporates the projection onto appropriate flow domains, ensuring enhanced handling of discontinuities and maintaining physical consistency and accuracy. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme through extensive and challenging numerical tests, showcasing their potential to facilitate further research and application in phase-transition traffic flow modeling. The ability of phase-transition models to embed the ``time-gap'' -- a crucial element in automated traffic control -- as a conserved variable aligns seamlessly with the control logic of automated vehicles, presenting significant potential for future applications, and the proposed numerical scheme now substantially facilitates exploring such potentials.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Joint Topology-Data Fusion Graph Network for Robust Traffic Speed Prediction with Data Anomalism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00085v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate traffic prediction is essential for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), yet current methods struggle with the inherent complexity and non-linearity of traffic dynamics, making it difficult to integrate spatial and temporal characteristics. Furthermore, existing approaches use static techniques to address non-stationary and anomalous historical data, which limits adaptability and undermines data smoothing. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Graph Fusion Enhanced Network (GFEN), an innovative framework for network-level traffic speed prediction. GFEN introduces a novel topological spatiotemporal graph fusion technique that meticulously extracts and merges spatial and temporal correlations from both data distribution and network topology using trainable methods, enabling the modeling of multi-scale spatiotemporal features. Additionally, GFEN employs a hybrid methodology combining a k-th order difference-based mathematical framework with an attention-based deep learning structure to adaptively smooth historical observations and dynamically mitigate data anomalies and non-stationarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GFEN surpasses state-of-the-art methods by approximately 6.3% in prediction accuracy and exhibits convergence rates nearly twice as fast as recent hybrid models, confirming its superior performance and potential to significantly enhance traffic prediction system efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods struggle with low-light conditions due to issues like indistinct small-object features, limited feature interaction, and poor image quality, which degrade detection accuracy and speed. To address this issue, we propose YOLO-LLTS, an end-to-end real-time traffic sign detection algorithm specifically designed for low-light environments. YOLO-LLTS introduces three main contributions: the High-Resolution Feature Map for Small Object Detection (HRFM-SOD) module to enhance small-object detection by mitigating feature dilution; the Multi-branch Feature Interaction Attention (MFIA) module to improve information extraction through multi-scale features interaction; and the Prior-Guided Feature Enhancement Module (PGFE) to enhance image quality by addressing noise, low contrast, and blurriness. Additionally, we construct a novel dataset, the Chinese Nighttime Traffic Sign Sample Set (CNTSSS), covering diverse nighttime scenarios. Experiments show that YOLO-LLTS achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous best methods by 2.7% mAP50 and 1.6% mAP50:95 on TT100K-night, 1.3% mAP50 and 1.9% mAP50:95 on CNTSSS, 7.5% mAP50 and 9.8% mAP50:95 on GTSDB-night, and superior results on CCTSDB2021.

| **[Causal-Entity Reflected Egocentric Traffic Accident Video Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23263v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Egocentricly comprehending the causes and effects of car accidents is crucial for the safety of self-driving cars, and synthesizing causal-entity reflected accident videos can facilitate the capability test to respond to unaffordable accidents in reality. However, incorporating causal relations as seen in real-world videos into synthetic videos remains challenging. This work argues that precisely identifying the accident participants and capturing their related behaviors are of critical importance. In this regard, we propose a novel diffusion model, Causal-VidSyn, for synthesizing egocentric traffic accident videos. To enable causal entity grounding in video diffusion, Causal-VidSyn leverages the cause descriptions and driver fixations to identify the accident participants and behaviors, facilitated by accident reason answering and gaze-conditioned selection modules. To support Causal-VidSyn, we further construct Drive-Gaze, the largest driver gaze dataset (with 1.54M frames of fixations) in driving accident scenarios. Extensive experiments show that Causal-VidSyn surpasses state-of-the-art video diffusion models in terms of frame quality and causal sensitivity in various tasks, including accident video editing, normal-to-accident video diffusion, and text-to-video generation.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 |

While existing surveys typically focus on isolated aspects of TSS, a comprehensive analytical framework bridging low-level and high-level perception tasks, particularly considering emerging technologies, remains lacking. This paper presents a systematic review of vision technologies in TSS, examining both low-level perception tasks (object detection, classification, and tracking) and high-level perception tasks (parameter estimation, anomaly detection, and behavior understanding). Specifically, we first provide a detailed methodological categorization and comprehensive performance evaluation for each task. Our investigation reveals five fundamental limitations in current TSS: perceptual data degradation in complex scenarios, data-driven learning constraints, semantic understanding gaps, sensing coverage limitations and computational resource demands. To address these challenges, we systematically analyze five categories of current approaches and potential trends: advanced perception enhancement, efficient learning paradigms, knowledge-enhanced understanding, cooperative sensing frameworks and efficient computing frameworks, critically assessing their real-world applicability. Furthermore, we evaluate the transformative potential of foundation models in TSS, which exhibit remarkable zero-shot learning abilities, strong generalization, and sophisticated reasoning capabilities across diverse tasks. This review provides a unified analytical framework bridging low-level and high-level perception tasks, systematically analyzes current limitations and solutions, and presents a structured roadmap for integrating emerging technologies, particularly foundation models, to enhance TSS capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Tensor Completion via Gradient Tensor Nulclear L1-L2 Norm for Traffic Data Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22732v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world scenarios, spatiotemporal traffic data frequently experiences dual degradation from missing values and noise caused by sensor malfunctions and communication failures. Therefore, effective data recovery methods are essential to ensure the reliability of downstream data-driven applications. while classical tensor completion methods have been widely adopted, they are incapable of modeling noise, making them unsuitable for complex scenarios involving simultaneous data missingness and noise interference. Existing Robust Tensor Completion (RTC) approaches offer potential solutions by separately modeling the actual tensor data and noise. However, their effectiveness is often constrained by the over-relaxation of convex rank surrogates and the suboptimal utilization of local consistency, leading to inadequate model accuracy. To address these limitations, we first introduce the tensor L1-L2 norm, a novel non-convex tensor rank surrogate that functions as an effective low-rank representation tool. Leveraging an advanced feature fusion strategy, we further develop the gradient tensor L1-L2 norm by incorporating the tensor L1-L2 norm in the gradient domain. By integrating the gradient tensor nuclear L1-L2 norm into the RTC framework, we propose the Robust Tensor Completion via Gradient Tensor Nuclear L1-L2 Norm (RTC-GTNLN) model, which not only fully exploits both global low-rankness and local consistency without trade-off parameter, but also effectively handles the dual degradation challenges of missing data and noise in traffic data. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the RTC-GTNLN model consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in complex recovery scenarios involving simultaneous missing values and noise.</p></details> |  |

The growing interest in this challenge highlights the need for comprehensive datasets that capture unstructured environments, enabling the development of more robust prediction models to enhance pedestrian safety and vehicle navigation. In this paper, we introduce an Indian driving pedestrian dataset designed to address the complexities of modeling pedestrian behavior in unstructured environments, such as illumination changes, occlusion of pedestrians, unsignalized scene types and vehicle-pedestrian interactions. The dataset provides high-level and detailed low-level comprehensive annotations focused on pedestrians requiring the ego-vehicle's attention. Evaluation of the state-of-the-art intention prediction methods on our dataset shows a significant performance drop of up to $\mathbf{15\%}$, while trajectory prediction methods underperform with an increase of up to $\mathbf{1208}$ MSE, defeating standard pedestrian datasets. Additionally, we present exhaustive quantitative and qualitative analysis of intention and trajectory baselines. We believe that our dataset will open new challenges for the pedestrian behavior research community to build robust models.

| **[Enhancing Car-Following Models with Bike Dynamics for Improved Traffic Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00062v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Road traffic simulations are crucial for establishing safe and efficient traffic environments. They are used to test various road applications before real-world implementation. SUMO is a well-known simulator for road networks and intermodal traffic, often used in conjunction with other tools to test various types of applications. Realistic simulations require accurate movement models for different road users, such as cars, bicycles, and buses. While realistic models are already implemented for most vehicle types, bicycles, which are essential for achieving safe and efficient traffic, can only be modeled as slow vehicles or fast pedestrians at present. This paper introduces the Realistic Bicycle Dynamics Model (RBDM), the first dedicated bicycle model for SUMO, addressing this significant gap. Leveraging real-world bicycle data from the SimRa dataset, the RBDM implements realistic speed, acceleration, and deceleration behaviors of bicycles in urban scenarios. The evaluation is conducted using the Monaco SUMO traffic scenario and a newly generated Berlin scenario in SUMO. The RBDM significantly outperforms the existing slow-vehicle approximation in SUMO, aligning more closely with real-world data. These results underscore the necessity of a realistic bicycle movement model for accurate simulations, given the significant differences in the movement profiles of bicycles, cars, and pedestrians. Furthermore, the model is tested for its ability to generalize to disparate scenarios and urban topologies, which is dependent on the manner and geographical region in which the SimRa data were gathered. In addition, recommendations are provided for how it could be adapted for use in different city topologies.</p></details> |  |

The culmination of this vision would be a generative simulated city, where given a map of the city and an autonomous vehicle (AV) software stack, the simulator can seamlessly simulate the trip from point A to point B by populating the city around the AV and controlling all aspects of the scene, from animating the dynamic agents (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) to controlling the traffic light states. We refer to this vision as CitySim, which requires an agglomeration of simulation technologies: scene generation to populate the initial scene, agent behavior modeling to animate the scene, occlusion reasoning, dynamic scene generation to seamlessly spawn and remove agents, and environment simulation for factors such as traffic lights. While some key technologies have been separately studied in various works, others such as dynamic scene generation and environment simulation have received less attention in the research community. We propose SceneDiffuser++, the first end-to-end generative world model trained on a single loss function capable of point A-to-B simulation on a city scale integrating all the requirements above. We demonstrate the city-scale traffic simulation capability of SceneDiffuser++ and study its superior realism under long simulation conditions.

The World Health Organization 2023 report highlights that road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death among individuals aged 5-29, with over half of fatalities involving pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists. This study addresses this critical issue by identifying high-risk areas in Montgomery County, Maryland, contributing to the global goal of halving road traffic deaths and injuries by 2030. Using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and spatial autocorrelation analysis, we estimate collision densities and identify hotspots for targeted interventions. Our findings reveal significant spatial clustering of traffic collisions, with distinct patterns in densely populated urban areas and rural regions, offering valuable insights for policymakers to enhance road safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unveiling the Power of Noise Priors: Enhancing Diffusion Models for Mobile Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13794v3)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of mobile traffic, i.e., network traffic from cellular base stations, is crucial for optimizing network performance and supporting urban development. However, the non-stationary nature of mobile traffic, driven by human activity and environmental changes, leads to both regular patterns and abrupt variations. Diffusion models excel in capturing such complex temporal dynamics due to their ability to capture the inherent uncertainties. Most existing approaches prioritize designing novel denoising networks but often neglect the critical role of noise itself, potentially leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective by emphasizing the role of noise in the denoising process. Our analysis reveals that noise fundamentally shapes mobile traffic predictions, exhibiting distinct and consistent patterns. We propose NPDiff, a framework that decomposes noise into prior and residual components, with the prior} derived from data dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to capture both regular and abrupt variations. NPDiff can seamlessly integrate with various diffusion-based prediction models, delivering predictions that are effective, efficient, and robust. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it achieves superior performance with an improvement over 30\%, offering a new perspective on leveraging diffusion models in this domain. We provide code and data at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/NPDiff.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluation of Traffic Signals for Daily Traffic Pattern](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21469v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The turning movement count data is crucial for traffic signal design, intersection geometry planning, traffic flow, and congestion analysis. This work proposes three methods called dynamic, static, and hybrid configuration for TMC-based traffic signals. A vision-based tracking system is developed to estimate the TMC of six intersections in Las Vegas using traffic cameras. The intersection design, route (e.g. vehicle movement directions), and signal configuration files with compatible formats are synthesized and imported into Simulation of Urban MObility for signal evaluation with realistic data. The initial experimental results based on estimated waiting times indicate that the cycle time of 90 and 120 seconds works best for all intersections. In addition, four intersections show better performance for dynamic signal timing configuration, and the other two with lower performance have a lower ratio of total vehicle count to total lanes of the intersection leg. Since daily traffic flow often exhibits a bimodal pattern, we propose a hybrid signal method that switches between dynamic and static methods, adapting to peak and off-peak traffic conditions for improved flow management. So, a built-in traffic generator module creates vehicle routes for 4 hours, including peak hours, and a signal design module produces signal schedule cycles according to static, dynamic, and hybrid methods. Vehicle count distributions are weighted differently for each zone (i.e., West, North, East, South) to generate diverse traffic patterns. The extended experimental results for 6 intersections with 4 hours of simulation time imply that zone-based traffic pattern distributions affect signal design selection. Although the static method works great for evenly zone-based traffic distribution, the hybrid method works well for highly weighted traffic at intersection pairs of the West-East and North-South zones.</p></details> |  |

Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) possess the capability to connect with each other and adjacent infrastructure, presenting novel opportunities for enhancing traffic flow and coordination. This work proposes a dual-mode model predictive control (MPC) architecture that tackles two interrelated issues: mitigating traffic density at signalized junctions and facilitating seamless, cooperative lane changes in high-density traffic conditions. The objective of this work is to facilitate responsive decision-making for CAVs, thereby enhancing the efficiency and safety of urban mobility. Moreover, we ensure recursive feasibility and convergence of the proposed MPC scheme by the integration of an online-calculated maximal control invariant terminal set. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed approach is validated through numerical simulation.</p></details> |  |

To model the coupling between vehicular noise and driving speed, we propose a bimodal-feature-fusion deep convolutional neural network (BMCNN). During preprocessing, an adaptive denoising and normalization strategy is applied to suppress environmental background interference; in the network architecture, parallel branches extract Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and wavelet-packet energy features, which are subsequently fused via a cross-modal attention mechanism in the intermediate feature space to fully exploit time-frequency information. Experimental results demonstrate that BMCNN achieves a classification accuracy of 87.56% on the SZUR-Acoustic Dataset and 96.28% on the public IDMT-Traffic dataset. Ablation studies and robustness tests on the Suzhou dataset further validate the contributions of each module to performance improvement and overfitting mitigation. The proposed acoustics-based speed classification method can be integrated into smart-city traffic management systems for real-time noise monitoring and speed estimation, thereby optimizing traffic flow control, reducing roadside noise pollution, and supporting sustainable urban planning.</p></details> |  |

However, complex spatiotemporal relationships in traffic systems continue to limit the performance of demand forecasting models. To improve the accuracy of spatiotemporal traffic demand prediction, we propose a new graph convolutional network structure called DKGCM. Specifically, we first consider the spatial flow distribution of different traffic nodes and propose a novel temporal similarity-based clustering graph convolution method, DK-GCN. This method utilizes Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and K-means clustering to group traffic nodes and more effectively capture spatial dependencies. On the temporal scale, we integrate the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) within the bidirectional Mamba deep learning framework to capture temporal dependencies in traffic demand. To further optimize model training, we incorporate the GRPO reinforcement learning strategy to enhance the loss function feedback mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms several advanced methods and achieves strong results on three public datasets.</p></details> | 39 pages, 14 figures |

The controller attenuates the emanant traffic waves by regulating its velocity according to the relative distance and velocity of the leader car. While regulating the velocity, the controller also prevents the collision of the ego vehicle with the lead vehicle within the range specified by the controller's design parameter. The controller design is based on a configurable quadratic curve on relative distance-relative velocity phase-space that allows the transition of the regulated velocity from (i) no modification of input, (ii) decelerating to match the leader's velocity (iii) braking to avoid any imminent collision. In this paper, we explore the phase-space properties of Followerstopper and provide a detailed description of a nonlinear control law that regulates the reference input to Followerstopper within the physics-informed boundaries. We also provide a new discussion on the nominal control law that regulates the reference speed to Followerstopper to avoid unrealistic and unsafe acceleration.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 fi...</summary><p>10 figures, 11 pages.

Traditional fixed-time signal control systems often lack the adaptability to manage dynamic traffic patterns effectively. This study explores the application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to optimize traffic signal coordination across multiple intersections within a simulated environment. Utilizing Pygame, a simulation was developed to model a network of interconnected intersections with randomly generated vehicle flows to reflect realistic traffic variability. A decentralized MARL controller was implemented, in which each traffic signal operates as an autonomous agent, making decisions based on local observations and information from neighboring agents. Performance was evaluated against a baseline fixed-time controller using metrics such as average vehicle wait time and overall throughput. The MARL approach demonstrated statistically significant improvements, including reduced average waiting times and improved throughput. These findings suggest that MARL-based dynamic control strategies hold substantial promise for improving urban traffic management efficiency. More research is recommended to address scalability and real-world implementation challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automating Traffic Monitoring with SHM Sensor Networks via Vision-Supervised Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19023v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bridges, as critical components of civil infrastructure, are increasingly affected by deterioration, making reliable traffic monitoring essential for assessing their remaining service life. Among operational loads, traffic load plays a pivotal role, and recent advances in deep learning - particularly in computer vision (CV) - have enabled progress toward continuous, automated monitoring. However, CV-based approaches suffer from limitations, including privacy concerns and sensitivity to lighting conditions, while traditional non-vision-based methods often lack flexibility in deployment and validation. To bridge this gap, we propose a fully automated deep-learning pipeline for continuous traffic monitoring using structural health monitoring (SHM) sensor networks. Our approach integrates CV-assisted high-resolution dataset generation with supervised training and inference, leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture the spatial structure and interdependence of sensor data. By transferring knowledge from CV outputs to SHM sensors, the proposed framework enables sensor networks to achieve comparable accuracy of vision-based systems, with minimal human intervention. Applied to accelerometer and strain gauge data in a real-world case study, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with classification accuracies of 99% for light vehicles and 94% for heavy vehicles.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on a vast corpus of text, have amassed remarkable capabilities of context-understanding and commonsense knowledge. This has opened up a new door for network attacks detection. Researchers have already initiated discussions regarding the application of LLMs on specific cyber-security tasks. Unfortunately, there remains a lack of comprehensive analysis on harnessing LLMs for traffic detection, as well as the opportunities and challenges. In this paper, we focus on unleashing the full potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in malicious traffic detection. We present a holistic view of the architecture of LLM-powered malicious traffic detection, including the procedures of Pre-training, Fine-tuning, and Detection. Especially, by exploring the knowledge and capabilities of LLM, we identify three distinct roles LLM can act in traffic classification: Classifier, Encoder, and Predictor. For each of them, the modeling paradigm, opportunities and challenges are elaborated. Finally, we present our design on LLM-powered DDoS detection as a case study. The proposed framework attains accurate detection on carpet bombing DDoS by exploiting LLMs' capabilities in contextual mining. The evaluation shows its efficacy, exhibiting a nearly 35% improvement compared to existing systems.</p></details> | accepted |

State-of-the-art models are generally graph neural networks that employ message passing to iteratively update atomic embeddings that are ultimately used for predicting properties. In this work we extend the message passing formalism with the inclusion of a continuous variable that accounts for fractional atomic existence. This allows us to calculate the gradient of the Gibbs free energy with respect to both the Cartesian coordinates of atoms and their existence. Using this we propose a gradient-based grand canonical optimization method and document its capabilities for a Cu(110) surface oxide.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Physics and Topology in Neural Networks for Learning Rigid Body Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11467v3)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rigid body interactions are fundamental to numerous scientific disciplines, but remain challenging to simulate due to their abrupt nonlinear nature and sensitivity to complex, often unknown environmental factors. These challenges call for adaptable learning-based methods capable of capturing complex interactions beyond explicit physical models and simulations. While graph neural networks can handle simple scenarios, they struggle with complex scenes and long-term predictions. We introduce a novel framework for modeling rigid body dynamics and learning collision interactions, addressing key limitations of existing graph-based methods. Our approach extends the traditional representation of meshes by incorporating higher-order topology complexes, offering a physically consistent representation. Additionally, we propose a physics-informed message-passing neural architecture, embedding physical laws directly in the model. Our method demonstrates superior accuracy, even during long rollouts, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen scenarios. Importantly, this work addresses the challenge of multi-entity dynamic interactions, with applications spanning diverse scientific and engineering domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures.

| **[Epidemiology-informed Network for Robust Rumor Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12949v3)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid spread of rumors on social media has posed significant challenges to maintaining public trust and information integrity. Since an information cascade process is essentially a propagation tree, recent rumor detection models leverage graph neural networks to additionally capture information propagation patterns, thus outperforming text-only solutions. Given the variations in topics and social impact of the root node, different source information naturally has distinct outreach capabilities, resulting in different heights of propagation trees. This variation, however, impedes the data-driven design of existing graph-based rumor detectors. Given a shallow propagation tree with limited interactions, it is unlikely for graph-based approaches to capture sufficient cascading patterns, questioning their ability to handle less popular news or early detection needs. In contrast, a deep propagation tree is prone to noisy user responses, and this can in turn obfuscate the predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel Epidemiology-informed Network (EIN) that integrates epidemiological knowledge to enhance performance by overcoming data-driven methods sensitivity to data quality. Meanwhile, to adapt epidemiology theory to rumor detection, it is expected that each users stance toward the source information will be annotated. To bypass the costly and time-consuming human labeling process, we take advantage of large language models to generate stance labels, facilitating optimization objectives for learning epidemiology-informed representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed EIN not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets but also exhibits enhanced robustness across varying tree depths.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Web Conference 2025 (WWW2025)</p></details> |

Yet transmitting raw point clouds or full feature maps overwhelms Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications, causing latency and scalability problems. We introduce EffiComm, an end-to-end framework that transmits less than 40% of the data required by prior art while maintaining state-of-the-art 3D object detection accuracy. EffiComm operates on Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) feature maps from any modality and applies a two-stage reduction pipeline: (1) Selective Transmission (ST) prunes low-utility regions with a confidence mask; (2) Adaptive Grid Reduction (AGR) uses a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to assign vehicle-specific keep ratios according to role and network load. The remaining features are fused with a soft-gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) attention layer, offering greater capacity and specialization for effective feature integration. On the OPV2V benchmark, EffiComm reaches 0.84 mAP@0.7 while sending only an average of approximately 1.5 MB per frame, outperforming previous methods on the accuracy-per-bit curve. These results highlight the value of adaptive, learned communication for scalable Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ITSC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Generating Clinically Realistic EHR Data via a Hierarchy- and Semantics-Guided Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20719v2)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating realistic synthetic electronic health records (EHRs) holds tremendous promise for accelerating healthcare research, facilitating AI model development and enhancing patient privacy. However, existing generative methods typically treat EHRs as flat sequences of discrete medical codes. This approach overlooks two critical aspects: the inherent hierarchical organization of clinical coding systems and the rich semantic context provided by code descriptions. Consequently, synthetic patient sequences often lack high clinical fidelity and have limited utility in downstream clinical tasks. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchy- and Semantics-Guided Transformer (HiSGT), a novel framework that leverages both hierarchical and semantic information for the generative process. HiSGT constructs a hierarchical graph to encode parent-child and sibling relationships among clinical codes and employs a graph neural network to derive hierarchy-aware embeddings. These are then fused with semantic embeddings extracted from a pre-trained clinical language model (e.g., ClinicalBERT), enabling the Transformer-based generator to more accurately model the nuanced clinical patterns inherent in real EHRs. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that HiSGT significantly improves the statistical alignment of synthetic data with real patient records, as well as supports robust downstream applications such as chronic disease classification. By addressing the limitations of conventional raw code-based generative models, HiSGT represents a significant step toward clinically high-fidelity synthetic data generation and a general paradigm suitable for interpretable medical code representation, offering valuable applications in data augmentation and privacy-preserving healthcare analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The camera ready version for ECAI-2025</p></details> |
| **[Pilot Contamination-Aware Graph Attention Network for Power Control in CFmMIMO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00967v2)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization-based power control algorithms are predominantly iterative with high computational complexity, making them impractical for real-time applications in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) systems. Learning-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative, and among them, graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their excellent performance in solving power control problems. However, all existing GNN-based approaches assume ideal orthogonality among pilot sequences for user equipments (UEs), which is unrealistic given that the number of UEs exceeds the available orthogonal pilot sequences in CFmMIMO schemes. Moreover, most learning-based methods assume a fixed number of UEs, whereas the number of active UEs varies over time in practice. Additionally, supervised training necessitates costly computational resources for computing the target power control solutions for a large volume of training samples. To address these issues, we propose a graph attention network for downlink power control in CFmMIMO systems that operates in a self-supervised manner while effectively handling pilot contamination and adapting to a dynamic number of UEs. Experimental results show its effectiveness, even in comparison to the optimal accelerated projected gradient method as a baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-Informed Graph Neural Networks for Transverse Momentum Estimation in CMS Trigger Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19205v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time particle transverse momentum ($p_T$) estimation in high-energy physics demands algorithms that are both efficient and accurate under strict hardware constraints. Static machine learning models degrade under high pileup and lack physics-aware optimization, while generic graph neural networks (GNNs) often neglect domain structure critical for robust $p_T$ regression. We propose a physics-informed GNN framework that systematically encodes detector geometry and physical observables through four distinct graph construction strategies that systematically encode detector geometry and physical observables: station-as-node, feature-as-node, bending angle-centric, and pseudorapidity ($\eta$)-centric representations. This framework integrates these tailored graph structures with a novel Message Passing Layer (MPL), featuring intra-message attention and gated updates, and domain-specific loss functions incorporating $p_{T}$-distribution priors. Our co-design methodology yields superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to existing baselines. Extensive experiments on the CMS Trigger Dataset validate the approach: a station-informed EdgeConv model achieves a state-of-the-art MAE of 0.8525 with $\ge55\%$ fewer parameters than deep learning baselines, especially TabNet, while an $\eta$-centric MPL configuration also demonstrates improved accuracy with comparable efficiency. These results establish the promise of physics-guided GNNs for deployment in resource-constrained trigger systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Network-Based Predictor for Optimal Quantum Hardware Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19093v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing variety of quantum hardware technologies, each with unique peculiarities such as connectivity and native gate sets, creates challenges when selecting the best platform for executing a specific quantum circuit. This selection process usually involves a brute-force approach: compiling the circuit on various devices and evaluating performance based on factors such as circuit depth and gate fidelity. However, this method is computationally expensive and does not scale well as the number of available quantum processors increases. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based predictor that automates hardware selection by analyzing the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) representation of a quantum circuit. Our study evaluates 498 quantum circuits (up to 27 qubits) from the MQT Bench dataset, compiled using Qiskit on four devices: three superconducting quantum processors (IBM-Kyiv, IBM-Brisbane, IBM-Sherbrooke) and one trapped-ion processor (IONQ-Forte). Performance is estimated using a metric that integrates circuit depth and gate fidelity, resulting in a dataset where 93 circuits are optimally compiled on the trapped-ion device, while the remaining circuits prefer superconducting platforms. By exploiting graph-based machine learning, our approach avoids extracting the circuit features for the model evaluation but directly embeds it as a graph, significantly accelerating the optimal target decision-making process and maintaining all the information. Experimental results prove 94.4% accuracy and an 85.5% F1 score for the minority class, effectively predicting the best compilation target. The developed code is publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/antotu/GNN-Model-Quantum-Predictor).</p></details> |  |
| **[Mean flow data assimilation using physics-constrained Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09476v3)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their widespread use, purely data-driven methods often suffer from overfitting, lack of physical consistency, and high data dependency, particularly when physical constraints are not incorporated. This study introduces a novel data assimilation approach that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with optimisation techniques to enhance the accuracy of mean flow reconstruction, using Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations as a baseline. The method leverages the adjoint approach, incorporating RANS-derived gradients as optimisation terms during GNN training, ensuring that the learned model adheres to physical laws and maintains consistency. Additionally, the GNN framework is well-suited for handling unstructured data, which is common in the complex geometries encountered in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The GNN is interfaced with the Finite Element Method (FEM) for numerical simulations, enabling accurate modelling in unstructured domains. We consider the reconstruction of mean flow past bluff bodies at low Reynolds numbers as a test case, addressing tasks such as sparse data recovery, denoising, and inpainting of missing flow data. The key strengths of the approach lie in its integration of physical constraints into the GNN training process, leading to accurate predictions with limited data, making it particularly valuable when data are scarce or corrupted. Results demonstrate significant improvements in the accuracy of mean flow reconstructions, even with limited training data, compared to analogous purely data-driven models.</p></details> |  |
| **[PBiLoss: Popularity-Aware Regularization to Improve Fairness in Graph-Based Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19067v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems, especially those based on graph neural networks (GNNs), have achieved remarkable success in capturing user-item interaction patterns. However, they remain susceptible to popularity bias--the tendency to over-recommend popular items--resulting in reduced content diversity and compromised fairness. In this paper, we propose PBiLoss, a novel regularization-based loss function designed to counteract popularity bias in graph-based recommender models explicitly. PBiLoss augments traditional training objectives by penalizing the model's inclination toward popular items, thereby encouraging the recommendation of less popular but potentially more personalized content. We introduce two sampling strategies: Popular Positive (PopPos) and Popular Negative (PopNeg), which respectively modulate the contribution of the positive and negative popular items during training. We further explore two methods to distinguish popular items: one based on a fixed popularity threshold and another without any threshold, making the approach flexible and adaptive. Our proposed method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art graph-based frameworks such as LightGCN and its variants. Comprehensive experiments across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that PBiLoss significantly improves fairness, as demonstrated by reductions in the Popularity-Rank Correlation for Users (PRU) and Popularity-Rank Correlation for Items (PRI), while maintaining or even enhancing standard recommendation accuracy and ranking metrics. These results highlight the effectiveness of directly embedding fairness objectives into the optimization process, providing a practical and scalable solution for balancing accuracy and equitable content exposure in modern recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProGMLP: A Progressive Framework for GNN-to-MLP Knowledge Distillation with Efficient Trade-offs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19031v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GNN-to-MLP (G2M) methods have emerged as a promising approach to accelerate Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by distilling their knowledge into simpler Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). These methods bridge the gap between the expressive power of GNNs and the computational efficiency of MLPs, making them well-suited for resource-constrained environments. However, existing G2M methods are limited by their inability to flexibly adjust inference cost and accuracy dynamically, a critical requirement for real-world applications where computational resources and time constraints can vary significantly. To address this, we introduce a Progressive framework designed to offer flexible and on-demand trade-offs between inference cost and accuracy for GNN-to-MLP knowledge distillation (ProGMLP). ProGMLP employs a Progressive Training Structure (PTS), where multiple MLP students are trained in sequence, each building on the previous one. Furthermore, ProGMLP incorporates Progressive Knowledge Distillation (PKD) to iteratively refine the distillation process from GNNs to MLPs, and Progressive Mixup Augmentation (PMA) to enhance generalization by progressively generating harder mixed samples. Our approach is validated through comprehensive experiments on eight real-world graph datasets, demonstrating that ProGMLP maintains high accuracy while dynamically adapting to varying runtime scenarios, making it highly effective for deployment in diverse application settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric Multi-color Message Passing Graph Neural Networks for Blood-brain Barrier Permeability Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18926v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of blood-brain barrier permeability (BBBP) is essential for central nervous system (CNS) drug development. While graph neural networks (GNNs) have advanced molecular property prediction, they often rely on molecular topology and neglect the three-dimensional geometric information crucial for modeling transport mechanisms. This paper introduces the geometric multi-color message-passing graph neural network (GMC-MPNN), a novel framework that enhances standard message-passing architectures by explicitly incorporating atomic-level geometric features and long-range interactions. Our model constructs weighted colored subgraphs based on atom types to capture the spatial relationships and chemical context that govern BBB permeability. We evaluated GMC-MPNN on three benchmark datasets for both classification and regression tasks, using rigorous scaffold-based splitting to ensure a robust assessment of generalization. The results demonstrate that GMC-MPNN consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving superior performance in both classifying compounds as permeable/non-permeable (AUC-ROC of 0.9704 and 0.9685) and in regressing continuous permeability values (RMSE of 0.4609, Pearson correlation of 0.7759). An ablation study further quantified the impact of specific atom-pair interactions, revealing that the model's predictive power derives from its ability to learn from both common and rare, but chemically significant, functional motifs. By integrating spatial geometry into the graph representation, GMC-MPNN sets a new performance benchmark and offers a more accurate and generalizable tool for drug discovery pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[ThermoRL:Structure-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Protein Mutation Design to Enhance Thermostability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18816v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing mutations to optimize protein thermostability remains challenging due to the complex relationship between sequence variations, structural dynamics, and thermostability, often assessed by \delta\delta G (the change in free energy of unfolding). Existing methods rely on experimental random mutagenesis or prediction models tested with pre-defined datasets, using sequence-based heuristics and treating enzyme design as a one-step process without iterative refinement, which limits design space exploration and restricts discoveries beyond known variations. We present ThermoRL, a framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) that leverages graph neural networks (GNN) to design mutations with enhanced thermostability. It combines a pre-trained GNN-based encoder with a hierarchical Q-learning network and employs a surrogate model for reward feedback, guiding the RL agent on where (the position) and which (mutant amino acid) to apply for enhanced thermostability. Experimental results show that ThermoRL achieves higher or comparable rewards than baselines while maintaining computational efficiency. It filters out destabilizing mutations and identifies stabilizing mutations aligned with experimental data. Moreover, ThermoRL accurately detects key mutation sites in unseen proteins, highlighting its strong generalizability. This RL-guided approach powered by GNN embeddings offers a robust alternative to traditional protein mutation design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ralts: Robust Aggregation for Enhancing Graph Neural Network Resilience on Bit-flip Errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18804v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in safety-critical applications, such as financial and medical networks, in which compromised predictions may cause catastrophic consequences. While existing research on GNN robustness has primarily focused on software-level threats, hardware-induced faults and errors remain largely underexplored. As hardware systems progress toward advanced technology nodes to meet high-performance and energy efficiency demands, they become increasingly susceptible to transient faults, which can cause bit flips and silent data corruption, a prominent issue observed by major technology companies (e.g., Meta and Google). In response, we first present a comprehensive analysis of GNN robustness against bit-flip errors, aiming to reveal system-level optimization opportunities for future reliable and efficient GNN systems. Second, we propose Ralts, a generalizable and lightweight solution to bolster GNN resilience to bit-flip errors. Specifically, Ralts exploits various graph similarity metrics to filter out outliers and recover compromised graph topology, and incorporates these protective techniques directly into aggregation functions to support any message-passing GNNs. Evaluation results demonstrate that Ralts effectively enhances GNN robustness across a range of GNN models, graph datasets, error patterns, and both dense and sparse architectures. On average, under a BER of $3\times10^{-5}$, these robust aggregation functions improve prediction accuracy by at least 20\% when errors present in model weights or node embeddings, and by at least 10\% when errors occur in adjacency matrices. Ralts is also optimized to deliver execution efficiency comparable to built-in aggregation functions in PyTorch Geometric.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resolving Indirect Calls in Binary Code via Cross-Reference Augmented Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18801v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary code analysis is essential in scenarios where source code is unavailable, with extensive applications across various security domains. However, accurately resolving indirect call targets remains a longstanding challenge in maintaining the integrity of static analysis in binary code. This difficulty arises because the operand of a call instruction (e.g., call rax) remains unknown until runtime, resulting in an incomplete inter-procedural control flow graph (CFG). Previous approaches have struggled with low accuracy and limited scalability. To address these limitations, recent work has increasingly turned to machine learning (ML) to enhance analysis. However, this ML-driven approach faces two significant obstacles: low-quality callsite-callee training pairs and inadequate binary code representation, both of which undermine the accuracy of ML models. In this paper, we introduce NeuCall, a novel approach for resolving indirect calls using graph neural networks. Existing ML models in this area often overlook key elements such as data and code cross-references, which are essential for understanding a program's control flow. In contrast, NeuCall augments CFGs with cross-references, preserving rich semantic information. Additionally, we leverage advanced compiler-level type analysis to generate high-quality callsite-callee training pairs, enhancing model precision and reliability. We further design a graph neural model that leverages augmented CFGs and relational graph convolutions for accurate target prediction. Evaluated against real-world binaries from GitHub and the Arch User Repository on x86_64 architecture, NeuCall achieves an F1 score of 95.2%, outperforming state-of-the-art ML-based approaches. These results highlight NeuCall's effectiveness in building precise inter-procedural CFGs and its potential to advance downstream binary analysis and security applications.</p></details> |  |

This limitation arises from indiscriminate neighbor aggregation and insufficient incorporation of higher-order structural patterns. To address these challenges, we propose GLANCE (Graph Logic Attention Network with Cluster Enhancement), a novel framework that integrates logic-guided reasoning, dynamic graph refinement, and adaptive clustering to enhance graph representation learning. GLANCE combines a logic layer for interpretable and structured embeddings, multi-head attention-based edge pruning for denoising graph structures, and clustering mechanisms for capturing global patterns. Experimental results in benchmark datasets, including Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin, demonstrate that GLANCE achieves competitive performance, offering robust and interpretable solutions for heterophilous graph scenarios. The proposed framework is lightweight, adaptable, and uniquely suited to the challenges of heterophilous graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A comparison of stretched-grid and limited-area modelling for data-driven regional weather forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18378v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regional machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) models based on graph neural networks have recently demonstrated remarkable predictive accuracy, outperforming numerical weather prediction models at lower computational costs. In particular, limited-area model (LAM) and stretched-grid model (SGM) approaches have emerged for generating high-resolution regional forecasts, based on initial conditions from a regional (re)analysis. While LAM uses lateral boundaries from an external global model, SGM incorporates a global domain at lower resolution. This study aims to understand how the differences in model design impact relative performance and potential applications. Specifically, the strengths and weaknesses of these two approaches are identified for generating deterministic regional forecasts over Europe. Using the Anemoi framework, models of both types are built by minimally adapting a shared architecture and trained using global and regional reanalyses in a near-identical setup. Several inference experiments have been conducted to explore their relative performance and highlight key differences. Results show that both LAM and SGM are competitive deterministic MLWP models with generally accurate and comparable forecasting performance over the regional domain. Various differences were identified in the performance of the models across applications. LAM is able to successfully exploit high-quality boundary forcings to make predictions within the regional domain and is suitable in contexts where global data is difficult to acquire. SGM is fully self-contained for easier operationalisation, can take advantage of more training data and significantly surpasses LAM in terms of (temporal) generalisability. Our paper can serve as a starting point for meteorological institutes to guide their choice between LAM and SGM in developing an operational data-driven forecasting system.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods face three main challenges: 1) Insufficient use of topological patterns in circuit graphs reduces prediction accuracy; 2) Data scarcity due to the complexity of annotations hinders model generalization; 3) Limited adaptability to various netlist formats. We propose GNN-ACLP, a graph neural networks (GNNs) based method featuring three innovations to tackle these challenges. First, we introduce the SEAL (learning from Subgraphs, Embeddings, and Attributes for Link prediction) framework and achieve port-level accuracy in circuit link prediction.

Especially predicting the future states of other traffic participants imposes a non-trivial challenge. Current SotA-models already show promising results when trained on real datasets (e.g. Argoverse2, NuScenes). Problems arise when these models are deployed to new/unseen areas. Typically, performance drops significantly, indicating that the models lack generalization. In this work, we introduce a new Graph Neural Network (GNN) that utilizes a heterogeneous graph consisting of traffic participants and vectorized road network. Latter, is used to classify goals, i.e. endpoints of the predicted trajectories, in a multi-staged approach, leading to a better generalization to unseen scenarios. We show the effectiveness of the goal selection process via cross-dataset evaluation, i.e. training on Argoverse2 and evaluating on NuScenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted on IEEE ITSC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Scalable Parameter Design for Superconducting Quantum Circuits with Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16354v3)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To demonstrate supremacy of quantum computing, increasingly large-scale superconducting quantum computing chips are being designed and fabricated. However, the complexity of simulating quantum systems poses a significant challenge to computer-aided design of quantum chips, especially for large-scale chips. Harnessing the scalability of graph neural networks (GNNs), we here propose a parameter designing algorithm for large-scale superconducting quantum circuits. The algorithm depends on the so-called 'three-stair scaling' mechanism, which comprises two neural-network models: an evaluator supervisedly trained on small-scale circuits for applying to medium-scale circuits, and a designer unsupervisedly trained on medium-scale circuits for applying to large-scale ones. We demonstrate our algorithm in mitigating quantum crosstalk errors. Frequencies for both single- and two-qubit gates (corresponding to the parameters of nodes and edges) are considered simultaneously. Numerical results indicate that the well-trained designer achieves notable advantages in efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability. For example, for large-scale superconducting quantum circuits consisting of around 870 qubits, our GNNs-based algorithm achieves 51% of the errors produced by the state-of-the-art algorithm, with a time reduction from 90 min to 27 sec. Overall, a better-performing and more scalable algorithm for designing parameters of superconducting quantum chips is proposed, which initially demonstrates the advantages of applying GNNs in superconducting quantum chips.</p></details> |  |
| **[Logical Characterizations of GNNs with Mean Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18145v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) with mean as the aggregation function. In the non-uniform setting, we show that such GNNs have exactly the same expressive power as ratio modal logic, which has modal operators expressing that at least a certain ratio of the successors of a vertex satisfies a specified property. The non-uniform expressive power of mean GNNs is thus higher than that of GNNs with max aggregation, but lower than for sum aggregation--the latter are characterized by modal logic and graded modal logic, respectively. In the uniform setting, we show that the expressive power relative to MSO is exactly that of alternation-free modal logic, under the natural assumptions that combination functions are continuous and classification functions are thresholds. This implies that, relative to MSO and in the uniform setting, mean GNNs are strictly less expressive than sum GNNs and max GNNs. When any of the assumptions is dropped, the expressive power increases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Knowledge Tracing Leveraging Higher-Order Information in Integrated Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18668v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of online learning has led to the development of various knowledge tracing (KT) methods. However, existing methods have overlooked the problem of increasing computational cost when utilizing large graphs and long learning sequences. To address this issue, we introduce Dual Graph Attention-based Knowledge Tracing (DGAKT), a graph neural network model designed to leverage high-order information from subgraphs representing student-exercise-KC relationships. DGAKT incorporates a subgraph-based approach to enhance computational efficiency. By processing only relevant subgraphs for each target interaction, DGAKT significantly reduces memory and computational requirements compared to full global graph models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DGAKT not only outperforms existing KT models but also sets a new standard in resource efficiency, addressing a critical need that has been largely overlooked by prior KT approaches.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a novel multimodal approach, the Long-Short Distance Graph Neural Network (LSDGNN). Based on the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), it constructs a long-distance graph neural network and a short-distance graph neural network to obtain multimodal features of distant and nearby utterances, respectively. To ensure that long- and short-distance features are as distinct as possible in representation while enabling mutual influence between the two modules, we employ a Differential Regularizer and incorporate a BiAffine Module to facilitate feature interaction. In addition, we propose an Improved Curriculum Learning (ICL) to address the challenge of data imbalance. By computing the similarity between different emotions to emphasize the shifts in similar emotions, we design a "weighted emotional shift" metric and develop a difficulty measurer, enabling a training process that prioritizes learning easy samples before harder ones. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[ViGText: Deepfake Image Detection with Vision-Language Model Explanations and Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18031v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid rise of deepfake technology, which produces realistic but fraudulent digital content, threatens the authenticity of media. Traditional deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes. Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes, helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Locate: GNN-Powered Vulnerability Path Discovery in Open Source Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17888v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting security vulnerabilities in open-source software is a critical task that is highly regarded in the related research communities. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature for detecting vulnerable codes and identifying the classes of vulnerabilities. However, there is still room to work in explaining the root causes of detected vulnerabilities through locating vulnerable statements and the discovery of paths leading to the activation of the vulnerability. While frameworks like SliceLocator offer explanations by identifying vulnerable paths, they rely on rule-based sink identification that limits their generalization. In this paper, we introduce VulPathFinder, an explainable vulnerability path discovery framework that enhances SliceLocator's methodology by utilizing a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) model for detecting sink statements, rather than relying on predefined rules. The proposed GNN captures semantic and syntactic dependencies to find potential sink points (PSPs), which are candidate statements where vulnerable paths end. After detecting PSPs, program slicing can be used to extract potentially vulnerable paths, which are then ranked by feeding them back into the target graph-based detector. Ultimately, the most probable path is returned, explaining the root cause of the detected vulnerability. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach by performing evaluations on a benchmark of the buffer overflow CWEs from the SARD dataset, providing explanations for the corresponding detected vulnerabilities. The results show that VulPathFinder outperforms both original SliceLocator and GNNExplainer (as a general GNN explainability tool) in discovery of vulnerability paths to identified PSPs.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 Figures |
| **[Towards Effective Open-set Graph Class-incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17687v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph class-incremental learning (GCIL) allows graph neural networks (GNNs) to adapt to evolving graph analytical tasks by incrementally learning new class knowledge while retaining knowledge of old classes. Existing GCIL methods primarily focus on a closed-set assumption, where all test samples are presumed to belong to previously known classes. Such an assumption restricts their applicability in real-world scenarios, where unknown classes naturally emerge during inference, and are absent during training. In this paper, we explore a more challenging open-set graph class-incremental learning scenario with two intertwined challenges: catastrophic forgetting of old classes, which impairs the detection of unknown classes, and inadequate open-set recognition, which destabilizes the retention of learned knowledge. To address the above problems, a novel OGCIL framework is proposed, which utilizes pseudo-sample embedding generation to effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting and enable robust detection of unknown classes. To be specific, a prototypical conditional variational autoencoder is designed to synthesize node embeddings for old classes, enabling knowledge replay without storing raw graph data. To handle unknown classes, we employ a mixing-based strategy to generate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples from pseudo in-distribution and current node embeddings. A novel prototypical hypersphere classification loss is further proposed, which anchors in-distribution embeddings to their respective class prototypes, while repelling OOD embeddings away. Instead of assigning all unknown samples into one cluster, our proposed objective function explicitly models them as outliers through prototype-aware rejection regions, ensuring a robust open-set recognition. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of OGCIL over existing GCIL and open-set GNN methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 33rd ACM International Conference on Multimedia (MM 2025)</p></details> |

The lattice geometry is encoded as a graph and processed by a graph neural network (GNN) followed by fully connected layers. The model is trained on Monte Carlo simulation data and accurately reproduces key features of the magnetization curve, including plateaus, critical transition points, and the effects of geometric frustration. It captures both local motifs and global symmetries, demonstrating that GNNs can infer magnetic behavior directly from structural connectivity. The proposed approach enables efficient prediction of magnetization without the need for additional Monte Carlo simulations.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures |

We model such process by an interacting particle system with attractive and repulsive forces and the Allen-Cahn force arising in the modeling of phase transition. The dynamics of the system is a reaction-diffusion process which can separate particles without blowing up. This induces an Allen-Cahn message passing (ACMP) for graph neural networks where the numerical iteration for the particle system solution constitutes the message passing propagation. ACMP which has a simple implementation with a neural ODE solver can propel the network depth up to one hundred of layers with theoretically proven strictly positive lower bound of the Dirichlet energy. It thus provides a deep model of GNNs circumventing the common GNN problem of oversmoothing. GNNs with ACMP achieve state of the art performance for real-world node classification tasks on both homophilic and heterophilic datasets.

To enhance handover (HO) performance, 3GPP introduced Conditional Handover (CHO) and Layer 1/Layer 2 Triggered Mobility (LTM) mechanisms in 5G. While these reactive HO strategies address the trade-off between HO failures (HOF) and ping-pong effects, they often result in inefficient radio resource utilization due to additional HO preparations. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes a proactive HO framework for mobility management in O-RAN, leveraging user-cell link predictions to identify the optimal target cell for HO. We explore various categories of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for link prediction and analyze the complexity of applying them to the mobility management domain. Two GNN models are compared using a real-world dataset, with experimental results demonstrating their ability to capture the dynamic and graph-structured nature of cellular networks. Finally, we present key insights from our study and outline future steps to enable the integration of GNN-based link prediction for mobility management in O-RAN networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 1 table.

Our approach leverages a graph neural network trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to efficiently estimate the robot's cost-to-go, formulated as local goal recommendations. A spatio-temporal path-searching module, which accounts for kinematic constraints, is then employed to generate a reference trajectory to facilitate solving the non-convex optimization problem used for explicit constraint enforcement. More importantly, we introduce an incremental action-masking mechanism and a privileged learning strategy, enabling end-to-end training of the proposed planner. Both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively addresses local planning in complex dynamic environments, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Compared with existing learning-optimization hybrid methods, our approach eliminates the dependency on high-fidelity simulation environments, offering significant advantages in computational efficiency and training scalability. The code will be released as open-source upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce TwiUSD, the first large-scale, manually annotated UserSD benchmark with explicit followee relationships, containing 16,211 users and 47,757 tweets. TwiUSD enables rigorous evaluation of stance models by integrating tweet content and social links, with superior scale and annotation quality. Building on this resource, we propose MRFG: a structure-aware framework that uses LLM-based relevance filtering and feature routing to address noise and context heterogeneity. MRFG employs multi-scale filtering and adaptively routes features through graph neural networks or multi-layer perceptrons based on topological informativeness. Experiments show MRFG consistently outperforms strong baselines (including PLMs, graph-based models, and LLM prompting) in both in-target and cross-target evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[HypoChainer: A Collaborative System Combining LLMs and Knowledge Graphs for Hypothesis-Driven Scientific Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17209v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern scientific discovery faces growing challenges in integrating vast and heterogeneous knowledge critical to breakthroughs in biomedicine and drug development. Traditional hypothesis-driven research, though effective, is constrained by human cognitive limits, the complexity of biological systems, and the high cost of trial-and-error experimentation. Deep learning models, especially graph neural networks (GNNs), have accelerated prediction generation, but the sheer volume of outputs makes manual selection for validation unscalable. Large language models (LLMs) offer promise in filtering and hypothesis generation, yet suffer from hallucinations and lack grounding in structured knowledge, limiting their reliability. To address these issues, we propose HypoChainer, a collaborative visualization framework that integrates human expertise, LLM-driven reasoning, and knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance hypothesis generation and validation. HypoChainer operates in three stages: First, exploration and contextualization -- experts use retrieval-augmented LLMs (RAGs) and dimensionality reduction to navigate large-scale GNN predictions, assisted by interactive explanations. Second, hypothesis chain formation -- experts iteratively examine KG relationships around predictions and semantically linked entities, refining hypotheses with LLM and KG suggestions. Third, validation prioritization -- refined hypotheses are filtered based on KG-supported evidence to identify high-priority candidates for experimentation, with visual analytics further strengthening weak links in reasoning. We demonstrate HypoChainer's effectiveness through case studies in two domains and expert interviews, highlighting its potential to support interpretable, scalable, and knowledge-grounded scientific discovery.</p></details> |  |

| **[Graph Neural Networks Gone Hogwild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00494v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) appear to be powerful tools to learn state representations for agents in distributed, decentralized multi-agent systems, but generate catastrophically incorrect predictions when nodes update asynchronously during inference. This failure under asynchrony effectively excludes these architectures from many potential applications where synchrony is difficult or impossible to enforce, e.g., robotic swarms or sensor networks. In this work we identify "implicitly-defined" GNNs as a class of architectures which is provably robust to asynchronous "hogwild" inference, adapting convergence guarantees from work in asynchronous and distributed optimization. We then propose a novel implicitly-defined GNN architecture, which we call an 'energy GNN'. We show that this architecture outperforms other GNNs from this class on a variety of synthetic tasks inspired by multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |

However, despite extensive benchmarking efforts, it remains unclear whether current Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) effectively capture core temporal patterns such as periodicity, cause-and-effect, and long-range dependencies. In this work, we introduce the Temporal Graph Reasoning Benchmark (T-GRAB), a comprehensive set of synthetic tasks designed to systematically probe the capabilities of TGNNs to reason across time. T-GRAB provides controlled, interpretable tasks that isolate key temporal skills: counting/memorizing periodic repetitions, inferring delayed causal effects, and capturing long-range dependencies over both spatial and temporal dimensions. We evaluate 11 temporal graph learning methods on these tasks, revealing fundamental shortcomings in their ability to generalize temporal patterns. Our findings offer actionable insights into the limitations of current models, highlight challenges hidden by traditional real-world benchmarks, and motivate the development of architectures with stronger temporal reasoning abilities.

Addressing this challenge, we present a novel variational network, a model-based learning paradigm that strategically merges the advantages and interpretability of classical iterative reconstruction with the power of deep learning. This approach integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) within the iterative Proximal Regularized Gauss Newton (PRGN) framework. By unrolling the PRGN algorithm, where each iteration corresponds to a network layer, we leverage the physical insights of nonlinear model fitting alongside the GNN's capacity to capture inter-frequency correlations. Notably, the GNN architecture preserves the irregular triangular mesh structure used in the solution of the nonlinear forward model, enabling accurate reconstruction of overlapping tissue fraction concentrations.</p></details> |  |

In particular, we are interested in learning distributed optimal controllers using graph recurrent neural networks (GRNNs). Most of the existing approaches result in centralized optimal controllers with offline training processes. However, as the increasing demand of network resilience, the optimal controllers are further expected to be distributed, and are desirable to be trained in an online distributed fashion, which are also the main contributions of our work. To solve this problem, we first propose a GRNN-based distributed optimal control method, and we cast the problem as a self-supervised learning problem. Then, the distributed online training is achieved via distributed gradient computation, and inspired by the (consensus-based) distributed optimization idea, a distributed online training optimizer is designed. Furthermore, the local closed-loop stability of the linear networked system under our proposed GRNN-based controller is provided by assuming that the nonlinear activation function of the GRNN-based controller is both local sector-bounded and slope-restricted. The effectiveness of our proposed method is illustrated by numerical simulations using a specifically developed simulator.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Yet, existing methods are unsuitable for routing on multigraphs, which feature multiple edges with distinct attributes between node pairs, despite their strong relevance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose two graph neural network-based methods to address multi-objective routing on multigraphs. Our first approach operates directly on the multigraph by autoregressively selecting edges until a tour is completed. The second model first simplifies the multigraph via a learned pruning strategy and then performs routing on the resulting simple graph. We evaluate both models empirically and demonstrate their strong performance across a range of problems and distributions.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 Figures |

This study compared performances of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GINs), applied to 7 different toxicological assay datasets of varying data abundance and endpoint, to perform binary classification of assay activation. Following pre-processing of molecular graphs, enforcement of class-balance and stratification of all datasets across 5 folds, Bayesian optimisations were carried out, for each GNN applied to each assay dataset (resulting in 21 unique Bayesian optimisations). Optimised GNNs performed at Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores ranging from 0.728-0.849 (averaged across all folds), naturally varying between specific assays and GNNs. GINs were found to consistently outperform GCNs and GATs, for the top 5 of 7 most data-abundant toxicological assays. GATs however significantly outperformed over the remaining 2 most data-scarce assays. This indicates that GINs are a more optimal architecture for data-abundant environments, whereas GATs are a more optimal architecture for data-scarce environments. Subsequent analysis of the explored higher-dimensional hyperparameter spaces, as well as optimised hyperparameter states, found that GCNs and GATs reached measurably closer optimised states with each other, compared to GINs, further indicating the unique nature of GINs as a GNN algorithm.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a Knowledge-aware Diffusion-Enhanced architecture using contrastive learning paradigms (KDiffE) for multimedia recommendations. Specifically, we first utilize original user-item graphs to build an attention-aware matrix into graph neural networks, which can learn the importance between users and items for main view construction. The attention-aware matrix is constructed by adopting a random walk with a restart strategy, which can preserve the importance between users and items to generate aggregation of attention-aware node features. Then, we propose a guided diffusion model to generate strongly task-relevant knowledge graphs with less noise for constructing a knowledge-aware contrastive view, which utilizes user embeddings with an edge connected to an item to guide the generation of strongly task-relevant knowledge graphs for enhancing the item's semantic information. We perform comprehensive experiments on three multimedia datasets that reveal the effectiveness of our KDiffE and its components on various state-of-the-art methods.

Predicting the accuracy of circuits composed of approximate components without performing complete synthesis remains a challenging problem. Current machine learning approaches used to automate this task require retraining for each new circuit configuration, making them computationally expensive and time-consuming. This paper presents ApproxGNN, a construction methodology for a pre-trained graph neural network model predicting QoR and HW cost of approximate accelerators employing approximate adders from a library. This approach is applicable in DSE for assignment of approximate components to operations in accelerator. Our approach introduces novel component feature extraction based on learned embeddings rather than traditional error metrics, enabling improved transferability to unseen circuits. ApproxGNN models can be trained with a small number of approximate components, supports transfer to multiple prediction tasks, utilizes precomputed embeddings for efficiency, and significantly improves accuracy of the prediction of approximation error. On a set of image convolutional filters, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed embeddings improve prediction accuracy (mean square error) by 50% compared to conventional methods. Furthermore, the overall prediction accuracy is 30% better than statistical machine learning approaches without fine-tuning and 54% better with fast finetuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at ICCAD 2025</p></details> |

This assumption does not hold in many real-world heterophilic graphs. Existing models for heterophilic graphs primarily rely on pairwise relationships, overlooking multi-scale information from higher-order structures. This leads to suboptimal performance, particularly under noise from conflicting class information across nodes. To address these challenges, we propose HPGNN, a novel model integrating Higher-order Personalized PageRank with Graph Neural Networks. HPGNN introduces an efficient high-order approximation of Personalized PageRank (PPR) to capture long-range and multi-scale node interactions. This approach reduces computational complexity and mitigates noise from surrounding information. By embedding higher-order structural information into convolutional networks, HPGNN effectively models key interactions across diverse graph dimensions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate HPGNN's effectiveness. The model achieves better performance than five out of seven state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs in downstream tasks while maintaining competitive performance on homophilic graphs. HPGNN's ability to balance multi-scale information and robustness to noise makes it a versatile solution for real-world graph learning challenges.

Bardhan et al., Machine learning-enhanced search for a vectorlike singlet B quark decaying to a singlet scalar or pseudoscalar, Phys. Rev. D 107 (2023) 115001; arXiv:2212.02442], we investigate the LHC prospects of pair-produced vectorlike $B$ quarks decaying exotically to a new gauge-singlet (pseudo)scalar field $\Phi$ and a $b$ quark. After the electroweak symmetry breaking, the $\Phi$ decays predominantly to $gg/bb$ final states, leading to a fully hadronic $2b+4j$ or $6b$ signature. Because of the large Standard Model background and the lack of leptonic handles, it is a difficult channel to probe. To overcome the challenge, we employ a hybrid deep learning model containing a graph neural network followed by a deep neural network. We estimate that such a state-of-the-art deep learning analysis pipeline can lead to a performance comparable to that in the semi-leptonic mode, taking the discovery (exclusion) reach up to about $M_B=1.8\:(2.4)$ TeV at HL-LHC when $B$ decays fully exotically, i.e., BR$(B \to b\Phi) = 100\%$.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Enhanced Reranking for Complementary Product Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16237v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complementary product recommendation, which aims to suggest items that are used together to enhance customer value, is a crucial yet challenging task in e-commerce. While existing graph neural network (GNN) approaches have made significant progress in capturing complex product relationships, they often struggle with the accuracy-diversity tradeoff, particularly for long-tail items. This paper introduces a model-agnostic approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the reranking of complementary product recommendations. Unlike previous works that use LLMs primarily for data preprocessing and graph augmentation, our method applies LLM-based prompting strategies directly to rerank candidate items retrieved from existing recommendation models, eliminating the need for model retraining. Through extensive experiments on public datasets, we demonstrate that our approach effectively balances accuracy and diversity in complementary product recommendations, with at least 50% lift in accuracy metrics and 2% lift in diversity metrics on average for the top recommended items across datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[BioGraphFusion: Graph Knowledge Embedding for Biological Completion and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14468v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivation: Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) are crucial for drug discovery and disease understanding, yet their completion and reasoning are challenging. Knowledge Embedding (KE) methods capture global semantics but struggle with dynamic structural integration, while Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel locally but often lack semantic understanding. Even ensemble approaches, including those leveraging language models, often fail to achieve a deep, adaptive, and synergistic co-evolution between semantic comprehension and structural learning. Addressing this critical gap in fostering continuous, reciprocal refinement between these two aspects in complex biomedical KGs is paramount. Results: We introduce BioGraphFusion, a novel framework for deeply synergistic semantic and structural learning. BioGraphFusion establishes a global semantic foundation via tensor decomposition, guiding an LSTM-driven mechanism to dynamically refine relation embeddings during graph propagation. This fosters adaptive interplay between semantic understanding and structural learning, further enhanced by query-guided subgraph construction and a hybrid scoring mechanism. Experiments across three key biomedical tasks demonstrate BioGraphFusion's superior performance over state-of-the-art KE, GNN, and ensemble models. A case study on Cutaneous Malignant Melanoma 1 (CMM1) highlights its ability to unveil biologically meaningful pathways.

| **[Feature Construction Using Network Control Theory and Rank Encoding for Graph Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15195v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we utilize the concept of average controllability in graphs, along with a novel rank encoding method, to enhance the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in social network classification tasks. GNNs have proven highly effective in various network-based learning applications and require some form of node features to function. However, their performance is heavily influenced by the expressiveness of these features. In social networks, node features are often unavailable due to privacy constraints or the absence of inherent attributes, making it challenging for GNNs to achieve optimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose two strategies for constructing expressive node features. First, we introduce average controllability along with other centrality metrics (denoted as NCT-EFA) as node-level metrics that capture critical aspects of network topology. Building on this, we develop a rank encoding method that transforms average controllability or any other graph-theoretic metric into a fixed-dimensional feature space, thereby improving feature representation. We conduct extensive numerical evaluations using six benchmark GNN models across four social network datasets to compare different node feature construction methods. Our results demonstrate that incorporating average controllability into the feature space significantly improves GNN performance. Moreover, the proposed rank encoding method outperforms traditional one-hot degree encoding, improving the ROC AUC from 68.7% to 73.9% using GraphSAGE on the GitHub Stargazers dataset, underscoring its effectiveness in generating expressive and efficient node representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Task Planning with Neuro-Symbolic Relaxation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15975v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world task planning requires long-horizon reasoning over large sets of entities with complex relationships and attributes, leading to a combinatorial explosion for classical symbolic planners. To prune the search space, recent methods prioritize searching on a simplified task only containing a few "important" entities predicted by a neural network. However, such a simple neuro-symbolic (NeSy) integration risks omitting critical entities and wasting resources on unsolvable simplified tasks. To enable Fast and reliable planning, we introduce a NeSy relaxation strategy (Flax), combining neural importance prediction with symbolic expansion. Specifically, we first learn a graph neural network to predict entity importance to create a simplified task and solve it with a symbolic planner. Then, we solve a rule-relaxed task to obtain a quick rough plan, and reintegrate all referenced entities into the simplified task to recover any overlooked but essential elements. Finally, we apply complementary rules to refine the updated task, keeping it both reliable and compact. Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world maze navigation benchmarks where a robot must traverse through a maze and interact with movable objects. The results show that Flax boosts the average success rate by 20.82% and cuts mean wall-clock planning time by 17.65% compared with the state-of-the-art NeSy baseline. We expect that Flax offers a practical path toward fast, scalable, long-horizon task planning in complex environments.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Graph Attention Specialized Expert Fusion Model for Node Classification: Based on Cora and Pubmed Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15784v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph node classification is a fundamental task in graph neural networks (GNNs), aiming to assign predefined class labels to nodes. On the PubMed citation network dataset, we observe significant classification difficulty disparities, with Category 2 achieving only 74.4% accuracy in traditional GCN, 7.5% lower than Category 1. To address this, we propose a Wasserstein-Rubinstein (WR) distance enhanced Expert Fusion Model (WR-EFM), training specialized GNN models for Categories 0/1 (with layer normalization and residual connections) and Multi-hop Graph Attention Networks (GAT) for Category 2. The WR distance metric optimizes representation similarity between models, particularly focusing on improving Category 2 performance. Our adaptive fusion strategy dynamically weights models based on category-specific performance, with Category 2 assigned a GAT weight of 0.8. WR distance further guides the fusion process by measuring distributional differences between model representations, enabling more principled integration of complementary features. Experimental results show WR-EFM achieves balanced accuracy across categories: 77.8% (Category 0), 78.0% (Category 1), and 79.9% (Category 2), outperforming both single models and standard fusion approaches. The coefficient of variation (CV) of WR-EFM's category accuracies is 0.013, 77.6% lower than GCN's 0.058, demonstrating superior stability. Notably, WR-EFM improves Category 2 accuracy by 5.5% compared to GCN, verifying the effectiveness of WR-guided fusion in capturing complex structural patterns. This work provides a novel paradigm for handling class-imbalanced graph classification tasks. To promote the research community, we release our project at https://github.com/s010m00n/GASEM4NC.</p></details> |  |
| **[BrainNetMLP: An Efficient and Effective Baseline for Functional Brain Network Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11538v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have made great progress in functional brain network classification by modeling the brain as a network of Regions of Interest (ROIs) and leveraging their connections to understand brain functionality and diagnose mental disorders. Various deep learning architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks, Graph Neural Networks, and the recent Transformer, have been developed. However, despite the increasing complexity of these models, the performance gain has not been as salient. This raises a question: Does increasing model complexity necessarily lead to higher classification accuracy? In this paper, we revisit the simplest deep learning architecture, the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and propose a pure MLP-based method, named BrainNetMLP, for functional brain network classification, which capitalizes on the advantages of MLP, including efficient computation and fewer parameters. Moreover, BrainNetMLP incorporates a dual-branch structure to jointly capture both spatial connectivity and spectral information, enabling precise spatiotemporal feature fusion. We evaluate our proposed BrainNetMLP on two public and popular brain network classification datasets, the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE). Experimental results demonstrate pure MLP-based methods can achieve state-of-the-art performance, revealing the potential of MLP-based models as more efficient yet effective alternatives in functional brain network classification.

However, LLMs, despite their general reasoning power, struggle significantly in specialized, data-sensitive tasks such as designing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This difficulty arises from (1) the inherent knowledge gaps in modeling the intricate, varying relationships between graph properties and suitable architectures and (2) the external noise from misleading descriptive inputs, often resulting in generic or even misleading model suggestions. Achieving proficiency in designing data-aware models -- defined as the meta-level capability to systematically accumulate, interpret, and apply data-specific design knowledge -- remains challenging for existing automated approaches, due to their inefficient construction and application of meta-knowledge. To achieve the meta-level proficiency, we propose DesiGNN, a knowledge-centered framework that systematically converts past model design experiences into structured, fine-grained knowledge priors well fitted to meta-learning with LLMs. To account for the inherent variability and external noise, DesiGNN aligns empirical property filtering from extensive benchmarks with adaptive elicitation of literature insights via LLMs. By constructing a solid meta-knowledge between unseen graph understanding and known effective architecture patterns, DesiGNN can deliver top-5.77% initial model proposals for unseen datasets within seconds, and achieve consistently superior performance with minimal search costs against baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variational Mode-Driven Graph Convolutional Network for Spatiotemporal Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16191v3)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on spatiotemporal (ST) traffic prediction using graph neural networks (GNNs). Given that ST data comprises non-stationary and complex temporal patterns, interpreting and predicting such trends is inherently challenging. Representing ST data in decomposed modes helps infer underlying behavior and assess the impact of noise on predictive performance. We propose a framework that decomposes ST data into interpretable modes using variational mode decomposition (VMD) and processes them through a neural network for future state forecasting. Unlike existing graph-based traffic forecasters that operate directly on raw or aggregated time series, the proposed hybrid approach, termed the Variational Mode Graph Convolutional Network (VMGCN), first decomposes non-stationary signals into interpretable variational modes by determining the optimal mode count via reconstruction-loss minimization and then learns both intramode and cross-mode spatiotemporal dependencies through a novel attention-augmented GCN. Additionally, we analyze the significance of each mode and the effect of bandwidth constraints on multi-horizon traffic flow predictions. The proposed two-stage design yields significant accuracy gains while providing frequency-level interpretability with demonstrated superior performance on the LargeST dataset for both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks. The implementation is publicly available on https://github.com/OsamaAhmad369/VMGCN.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM T...</summary><p>ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST) Submission, 2025</p></details> |

This paper proposes an attention-based Graph Neural Network framework that captures spatial-temporal dependencies by modeling the food delivery environment as a graph. In this graph, nodes represent urban delivery zones, while edges reflect spatial proximity and inter-regional order flow patterns derived from historical data. The attention mechanism dynamically weighs the influence of neighboring zones, enabling the model to focus on the most contextually relevant areas during prediction. Temporal trends are jointly learned alongside spatial interactions, allowing the model to adapt to evolving demand patterns. Extensive experiments on real-world food delivery datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in forecasting future order volumes with high accuracy. The framework offers a scalable and adaptive solution to support proactive fleet positioning, resource allocation, and dispatch optimization in urban food delivery operations.</p></details> |  |

An Agent-Based Simulation of Human Mobility in a Futuristic Smart City](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15143v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the feasibility of human mobility in The Line, a proposed 170-kilometer linear smart city in NEOM, Saudi Arabia. To assess whether citizens can move freely within this unprecedented urban topology, we develop a hybrid simulation framework that integrates agent-based modeling, reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and graph neural networks. The simulation captures multi-modal transportation behaviors across 50 vertical levels and varying density scenarios using both synthetic data and real-world traces from high-density cities. Our experiments reveal that with the full AI-integrated architecture, agents achieved an average commute time of 7.8 to 8.4 minutes, a satisfaction rate exceeding 89 percent, and a reachability index of over 91 percent, even during peak congestion periods. Ablation studies confirmed that the removal of intelligent modules such as reinforcement learning or graph neural networks significantly degrades performance, with commute times increasing by up to 85 percent and reachability falling below 70 percent. Environmental modeling further demonstrated low energy consumption and minimal CO2 emissions when electric modes are prioritized. The findings suggest that freedom of movement is not only conceptually achievable in The Line, but also operationally realistic if supported by adaptive AI systems, sustainable infrastructure, and real-time feedback loops.</p></details> |  |

However, their applications have been limited primarily to small-scale datasets because of memory constraints. While distributed training offers a solution, current frameworks lack support for spatiotemporal models and overlook the properties of spatiotemporal data. Informed by a scaling study on a large-scale workload, we present PyTorch Geometric Temporal Index (PGT-I), an extension to PyTorch Geometric Temporal that integrates distributed data parallel training and two novel strategies: index-batching and distributed-index-batching. Our index techniques exploit spatiotemporal structure to construct snapshots dynamically at runtime, significantly reducing memory overhead, while distributed-index-batching extends this approach by enabling scalable processing across multiple GPUs. Our techniques enable the first-ever training of an ST-GNN on the entire PeMS dataset without graph partitioning, reducing peak memory usage by up to 89% and achieving up to a 11.78x speedup over standard DDP with 128 GPUs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the 2025 International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis</p></details> |

These difficulties stem from iterative message-passing techniques, which place significant computational demands and require extensive GPU memory, particularly when dealing with the neighbor explosion issue inherent in large-scale graphs. This paper introduces a scalable, low-cost, flexible, and efficient GNN framework called LPS-GNN, which can perform representation learning on 100 billion graphs with a single GPU in 10 hours and shows a 13.8% improvement in User Acquisition scenarios. We examine existing graph partitioning methods and design a superior graph partition algorithm named LPMetis. In particular, LPMetis outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on various evaluation metrics. In addition, our paper proposes a subgraph augmentation strategy to enhance the model's predictive performance. It exhibits excellent compatibility, allowing the entire framework to accommodate various GNN algorithms. Successfully deployed on the Tencent platform, LPS-GNN has been tested on public and real-world datasets, achieving performance lifts of 8. 24% to 13. 89% over SOTA models in online applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable Graph Neural Networks via Structural Externalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17848v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved outstanding performance across a wide range of graph-related tasks. However, their "black-box" nature poses significant challenges to their explainability, and existing methods often fail to effectively capture the intricate interaction patterns among nodes within the network. In this work, we propose a novel explainability framework, GraphEXT, which leverages cooperative game theory and the concept of social externalities. GraphEXT partitions graph nodes into coalitions, decomposing the original graph into independent subgraphs. By integrating graph structure as an externality and incorporating the Shapley value under externalities, GraphEXT quantifies node importance through their marginal contributions to GNN predictions as the nodes transition between coalitions. Unlike traditional Shapley value-based methods that primarily focus on node attributes, our GraphEXT places greater emphasis on the interactions among nodes and the impact of structural changes on GNN predictions. Experimental studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that GraphEXT outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of fidelity across diverse GNN architectures , significantly enhancing the explainability of GNN models.</p></details> |  |

Although GNNs inherently encode specific inductive biases (e.g., acting as low-pass or high-pass filters), most existing methods implicitly assume conditional independence among node labels in their optimization objectives. While this assumption is suitable for traditional classification tasks such as image recognition, it contradicts the intuitive observation that node labels in graphs remain correlated, even after conditioning on the graph structure. To make structured predictions for node labels, we propose ReDiSC, namely, Reparameterized masked Diffusion model for Structured node Classification. ReDiSC estimates the joint distribution of node labels using a reparameterized masked diffusion model, which is learned through the variational expectation-maximization (EM) framework. Our theoretical analysis shows the efficiency advantage of ReDiSC in the E-step compared to DPM-SNC, a state-of-the-art model that relies on a manifold-constrained diffusion model in continuous domain. Meanwhile, we explicitly link ReDiSC's M-step objective to popular GNN and label propagation hybrid approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReDiSC achieves superior or highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GNN, label propagation, and diffusion-based baselines across both homophilic and heterophilic graphs of varying sizes. Notably, ReDiSC scales effectively to large-scale datasets on which previous structured diffusion methods fail due to computational constraints, highlighting its significant practical advantage in structured node classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, the traditional methods rely on standard graph structures often fail to capture the intricate higher-order spatio-temporal correlations inherent in real-world traffic dynamics. Standard graphs cannot fully represent the spatial relationships within road networks, which limits the effectiveness of graph-based approaches. In contrast, directed hypergraphs provide more accurate representation of spatial information to model complex directed relationships among multiple nodes. In this paper, we propose DHLight, a novel multi-agent policy-based framework that synergistically integrates directed hypergraph learning module. This framework introduces a novel dynamic directed hypergraph construction mechanism, which captures complex and evolving spatio-temporal relationships among intersections in road networks. By leveraging the directed hypergraph relational structure, DHLight empowers agents to achieve adaptive decision-making in traffic signal control. The effectiveness of DHLight is validated against state-of-the-art baselines through extensive experiments in various network datasets.

A GNN with shallow layer architectures can only learn short-term relation or localized structure information, limiting its power of learning long-term connection, evidenced by their inferior learning performance on heterophilous graphs. Tackling oversmoothing is crucial for harnessing deep-layer architectures for GNNs. To date, many methods have been proposed to alleviate oversmoothing. The vast difference behind their design principles, combined with graph complications, make it difficult to understand and even compare the difference between different approaches in tackling the oversmoothing. In this paper, we propose ATNPA, a unified view with five key steps: Augmentation, Transformation, Normalization, Propagation, and Aggregation, to summarize GNN oversmoothing alleviation approaches. We first propose a taxonomy for GNN oversmoothing alleviation which includes three themes to tackle oversmoothing. After that, we separate all methods into six categories, followed by detailed reviews of representative methods, including their relation to ATNPA, and discussion of their niche, strength, and weakness. The review not only draws an in-depth understanding of existing methods in the field but also shows a clear road map for future study.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages; Published at Knowledge and Information Systems Journal</p></details> |

Large-scale multi-site studies have exist, but they have acquisition-related biases due to scanner heterogeneity, compromising imaging consistency and downstream analyses. While existing SC harmonization methods - such as linear regression (LR), ComBat, and deep learning techniques - mitigate these biases, they often rely on detailed metadata, traveling subjects (TS), or overlook the graph-topology of SCs. To address these limitations, we propose a site-conditioned deep harmonization framework that harmonizes SCs across diverse acquisition sites without requiring metadata or TS that we test in a simulated scenario based on the Human Connectome Dataset. Within this framework, we benchmark three deep architectures - a fully connected autoencoder (AE), a convolutional AE, and a graph convolutional AE - against a top-performing LR baseline. While non-graph models excel in edge-weight prediction and edge existence detection, the graph AE demonstrates superior preservation of topological structure and subject-level individuality, as reflected by graph metrics and fingerprinting accuracy, respectively. Although the LR baseline achieves the highest numerical performance by explicitly modeling acquisition parameters, it lacks applicability to real-world multi-site use cases as detailed acquisition metadata is often unavailable. Our results highlight the critical role of model architecture in SC harmonization performance and demonstrate that graph-based approaches are particularly well-suited for structure-aware, domain-generalizable SC harmonization in large-scale multi-site SC studies.</p></details> |  |

Graph-based machine learning models have emerged as a promising solution that combines attribute and relational data to uncover intricate patterns. However, the scarcity of anomalous data exacerbates the challenge, which requires innovative strategies to enhance model learning with limited information. In this paper, we hypothesize that the incorporation of the influence of the nodes, quantified through average controllability, can significantly improve the performance of anomaly detection. We propose two novel approaches to integrate average controllability into graph-based frameworks: (1) using average controllability as an edge weight and (2) encoding it as a one-hot edge attribute vector. Through rigorous evaluation on real-world and synthetic networks with six state-of-the-art baselines, our proposed methods demonstrate improved performance in identifying anomalies, highlighting the critical role of controllability measures in enhancing the performance of graph machine learning models. This work underscores the potential of integrating average controllability as additional metrics to address the challenges of anomaly detection in sparse and imbalanced datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>confe...</summary><p>conference paper published in IEEE CAI 2025</p></details> |

While existing Temporal Graph Neural Networks (T-GNNs) have achieved notable success by leveraging complex architectures to model temporal and structural dependencies, they often suffer from scalability and efficiency challenges due to high computational overhead. In this paper, we propose EAGLE, a lightweight framework that integrates short-term temporal recency and long-term global structural patterns. EAGLE consists of a time-aware module that aggregates information from a node's most recent neighbors to reflect its immediate preferences, and a structure-aware module that leverages temporal personalized PageRank to capture the influence of globally important nodes. To balance these attributes, EAGLE employs an adaptive weighting mechanism to dynamically adjust their contributions based on data characteristics. Also, EAGLE eliminates the need for complex multi-hop message passing or memory-intensive mechanisms, enabling significant improvements in efficiency. Extensive experiments on seven real-world temporal graphs demonstrate that EAGLE consistently achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art T-GNNs in both effectiveness and efficiency, delivering more than a 50x speedup over effective transformer-based T-GNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted in 2024.

| **[SamGoG: A Sampling-Based Graph-of-Graphs Framework for Imbalanced Graph Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13741v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in graph classification tasks by capturing both structural and feature-based representations. However, real-world graphs often exhibit two critical forms of imbalance: class imbalance and graph size imbalance. These imbalances can bias the learning process and degrade model performance. Existing methods typically address only one type of imbalance or incur high computational costs. In this work, we propose SamGoG, a sampling-based Graph-of-Graphs (GoG) learning framework that effectively mitigates both class and graph size imbalance. SamGoG constructs multiple GoGs through an efficient importance-based sampling mechanism and trains on them sequentially. This sampling mechanism incorporates the learnable pairwise similarity and adaptive GoG node degree to enhance edge homophily, thus improving downstream model quality. SamGoG can seamlessly integrate with various downstream GNNs, enabling their efficient adaptation for graph classification tasks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SamGoG achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to a 15.66% accuracy improvement with 6.7$\times$ training acceleration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Deformable Body Interactions With Adaptive Spatial Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13707v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating interactions between deformable bodies is vital in fields like material science, mechanical design, and robotics. While learning-based methods with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective at solving complex physical systems, they encounter scalability issues when modeling deformable body interactions. To model interactions between objects, pairwise global edges have to be created dynamically, which is computationally intensive and impractical for large-scale meshes. To overcome these challenges, drawing on insights from geometric representations, we propose an Adaptive Spatial Tokenization (AST) method for efficient representation of physical states. By dividing the simulation space into a grid of cells and mapping unstructured meshes onto this structured grid, our approach naturally groups adjacent mesh nodes. We then apply a cross-attention module to map the sparse cells into a compact, fixed-length embedding, serving as tokens for the entire physical state. Self-attention modules are employed to predict the next state over these tokens in latent space. This framework leverages the efficiency of tokenization and the expressive power of attention mechanisms to achieve accurate and scalable simulation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in modeling deformable body interactions. Notably, it remains effective on large-scale simulations with meshes exceeding 100,000 nodes, where existing methods are hindered by computational limitations. Additionally, we contribute a novel large-scale dataset encompassing a wide range of deformable body interactions to support future research in this area.</p></details> | 21 pages, 15 figures |

While the framework has yielded promising results in various combinatorial problems, we show that the performance of PI-GNNs systematically plummets with an increasing density of the combinatorial problem graphs. Our analysis reveals an interesting phase transition in the PI-GNNs' training dynamics, associated with degenerate solutions for the denser problems, highlighting a discrepancy between the relaxed, real-valued model outputs and the binary-valued problem solutions. To address the discrepancy, we propose principled alternatives to the naive strategy used in PI-GNNs by building on insights from fuzzy logic and binarized neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate that the portfolio of proposed methods significantly improves the performance of PI-GNNs in increasingly dense settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2025).

To address this expressivity gap, we propose the Lorentzian Graph Isomorphic Network (LGIN), a novel HGNN designed for enhanced discrimination within the Lorentzian model. LGIN introduces a new update rule that preserves the Lorentzian metric while effectively capturing richer structural information. This marks a significant step towards more expressive GNNs on Riemannian manifolds. Extensive evaluations across nine benchmark datasets demonstrate LGIN's superior performance, consistently outperforming or matching state-of-the-art hyperbolic and Euclidean baselines, showcasing its ability to capture complex graph structures. LGIN is the first to adapt principles of powerful, highly discriminative GNN architectures to a Riemannian manifold.

| **[AI-Accelerated Flow Simulation: A Robust Auto-Regressive Framework for Long-Term CFD Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05657v3)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study addresses the critical challenge of error accumulation in spatio-temporal auto-regressive (AR) predictions within scientific machine learning models by exploring temporal integration schemes and adaptive multi-step rollout strategies. We introduce the first implementation of the two-step Adams-Bashforth method specifically tailored for data-driven AR prediction, leveraging historical derivative information to enhance numerical stability without additional computational overhead. To validate our approach, we systematically evaluate time integration schemes across canonical 2D PDEs before extending to complex Navier-Stokes cylinder vortex shedding dynamics. Additionally, we develop three novel adaptive weighting strategies that dynamically adjust the importance of different future time steps during multi-step rollout training. Our analysis reveals that as physical complexity increases, such sophisticated rollout techniques become essential, with the Adams-Bashforth scheme demonstrating consistent robustness across investigated systems and our best adaptive approach delivering an 89% improvement over conventional fixed-weight methods while maintaining similar computational costs. For the complex Navier-Stokes vortex shedding problem, despite using an extremely lightweight graph neural network with just 1,177 trainable parameters and training on only 50 snapshots, our framework accurately predicts 350 future time steps reducing mean squared error from 0.125 (single-step direct prediction) to 0.002 (Adams-Bashforth with proposed multi-step rollout). Our integrated methodology demonstrates an 83% improvement over standard noise injection techniques and maintains robustness under severe spatial constraints; specifically, when trained on only a partial spatial domain, it still achieves 58% and 27% improvements over direct prediction and forward Euler methods, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Network Surrogates for Contacting Deformable Bodies with Necessary and Sufficient Contact Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13459v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surrogate models for the rapid inference of nonlinear boundary value problems in mechanics are helpful in a broad range of engineering applications. However, effective surrogate modeling of applications involving the contact of deformable bodies, especially in the context of varying geometries, is still an open issue. In particular, existing methods are confined to rigid body contact or, at best, contact between rigid and soft objects with well-defined contact planes. Furthermore, they employ contact or collision detection filters that serve as a rapid test but use only the necessary and not sufficient conditions for detection. In this work, we present a graph neural network architecture that utilizes continuous collision detection and, for the first time, incorporates sufficient conditions designed for contact between soft deformable bodies. We test its performance on two benchmarks, including a problem in soft tissue mechanics of predicting the closed state of a bioprosthetic aortic valve. We find a regularizing effect on adding additional contact terms to the loss function, leading to better generalization of the network. These benefits hold for simple contact at similar planes and element normal angles, and complex contact at differing planes and element normal angles. We also demonstrate that the framework can handle varying reference geometries. However, such benefits come with high computational costs during training, resulting in a trade-off that may not always be favorable. We quantify the training cost and the resulting inference speedups on various hardware architectures. Importantly, our graph neural network implementation results in up to a thousand-fold speedup for our benchmark problems at inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Air Traffic Controller Task Demand via Graph Neural Networks: An Interpretable Approach to Airspace Complexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13423v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time assessment of near-term Air Traffic Controller (ATCO) task demand is a critical challenge in an increasingly crowded airspace, as existing complexity metrics often fail to capture nuanced operational drivers beyond simple aircraft counts. This work introduces an interpretable Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework to address this gap. Our attention-based model predicts the number of upcoming clearances, the instructions issued to aircraft by ATCOs, from interactions within static traffic scenarios. Crucially, we derive an interpretable, per-aircraft task demand score by systematically ablating aircraft and measuring the impact on the model's predictions. Our framework significantly outperforms an ATCO-inspired heuristic and is a more reliable estimator of scenario complexity than established baselines. The resulting tool can attribute task demand to specific aircraft, offering a new way to analyse and understand the drivers of complexity for applications in controller training and airspace redesign.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Author Accepted Manuscript version of paper at the AIAA AVIATION Forum 2025</p></details> |
| **[Generative Diffusion Models for Resource Allocation in Wireless Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20277v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a supervised training algorithm for learning stochastic resource allocation policies with generative diffusion models (GDMs). We formulate the allocation problem as the maximization of an ergodic utility function subject to ergodic Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. Given samples from a stochastic expert policy that yields a near-optimal solution to the constrained optimization problem, we train a GDM policy to imitate the expert and generate new samples from the optimal distribution. We achieve near-optimal performance through the sequential execution of the generated samples. To enable generalization to a family of network configurations, we parameterize the backward diffusion process with a graph neural network (GNN) architecture. We present numerical results in a case study of power control.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spectral Interpretation of Redundancy in a Graph Reservoir](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12963v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reservoir computing has been successfully applied to graphs as a preprocessing method to improve the training efficiency of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, a common issue that arises when repeatedly applying layer operators on graphs is over-smoothing, which consists in the convergence of graph signals toward low-frequency components of the graph Laplacian. This work revisits the definition of the reservoir in the Multiresolution Reservoir Graph Neural Network (MRGNN), a spectral reservoir model, and proposes a variant based on a Fairing algorithm originally introduced in the field of surface design in computer graphics. This algorithm provides a pass-band spectral filter that allows smoothing without shrinkage, and it can be adapted to the graph setting through the Laplacian operator. Given its spectral formulation, this method naturally connects to GNN architectures for tasks where smoothing, when properly controlled, can be beneficial,such as graph classification. The core contribution of the paper lies in the theoretical analysis of the algorithm from a random walks perspective. In particular, it shows how tuning the spectral coefficients can be interpreted as modulating the contribution of redundant random walks. Exploratory experiments based on the MRGNN architecture illustrate the potential of this approach and suggest promising directions for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for presentation at the 3rd International Workshop on Reservoir Computing (RC 2025) at ICANN 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Channel Graph Neural Network for Financial Risk Prediction of NEEQ Enterprises](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12787v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the continuous evolution of China's multi-level capital market, the National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ), also known as the "New Third Board," has become a critical financing platform for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, due to their limited scale and financial resilience, many NEEQ-listed companies face elevated risks of financial distress. To address this issue, we propose a multi-channel deep learning framework that integrates structured financial indicators, textual disclosures, and enterprise relationship data for comprehensive financial risk prediction. Specifically, we design a Triple-Channel Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) that processes numeric, textual, and graph-based inputs separately. These modality-specific representations are fused using an attention-based mechanism followed by a gating unit to enhance robustness and prediction accuracy. Experimental results on data from 7,731 real-world NEEQ companies demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms traditional machine learning methods and single-modality baselines in terms of AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score. This work provides theoretical and practical insights into risk modeling for SMEs and offers a data-driven tool to support financial regulators and investors.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures.

| **[MS-DGCNN++: A Multi-Scale Fusion Dynamic Graph Neural Network with Biological Knowledge Integration for LiDAR Tree Species Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12602v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tree species classification from terrestrial LiDAR point clouds is challenging because of the complex multi-scale geometric structures in forest environments. Existing approaches using multi-scale dynamic graph convolutional neural networks (MS-DGCNN) employ parallel multi-scale processing, which fails to capture the semantic relationships between the hierarchical levels of the tree architecture. We present MS-DGCNN++, a hierarchical multiscale fusion dynamic graph convolutional network that uses semantically meaningful feature extraction at local, branch, and canopy scales with cross-scale information propagation. Our method employs scale-specific feature engineering, including standard geometric features for the local scale, normalized relative vectors for the branch scale, and distance information for the canopy scale. This hierarchical approach replaces uniform parallel processing with semantically differentiated representations that are aligned with the natural tree structure. Under the same proposed tree species data augmentation strategy for all experiments, MS-DGCNN++ achieved an accuracy of 94.96 \% on STPCTLS, outperforming DGCNN, MS-DGCNN, and the state-of-the-art model PPT. On FOR-species20K, it achieves 67.25\% accuracy (6.1\% improvement compared to MS-DGCNN). For standard 3D object recognition, our method outperformed DGCNN and MS-DGCNN with overall accuracies of 93.15\% on ModelNet40 and 94.05\% on ModelNet10. With lower parameters and reduced complexity compared to state-of-the-art transformer approaches, our method is suitable for resource-constrained applications while maintaining a competitive accuracy. Beyond tree classification, the method generalizes to standard 3D object recognition, establishing it as a versatile solution for diverse point cloud processing applications. The implementation code is publicly available at https://github.com/said-ohamouddou/MS-DGCNN2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rel-HNN: Split Parallel Hypergraph Neural Network for Learning on Relational Databases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12562v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relational databases (RDBs) are ubiquitous in enterprise and real-world applications. Flattening the database poses challenges for deep learning models that rely on fixed-size input representations to capture relational semantics from the structured nature of relational data. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been proposed to address this, but they often oversimplify relational structures by modeling all the tuples as monolithic nodes and ignoring intra-tuple associations. In this work, we propose a novel hypergraph-based framework, that we call rel-HNN, which models each unique attribute-value pair as a node and each tuple as a hyperedge, enabling the capture of fine-grained intra-tuple relationships. Our approach learns explicit multi-level representations across attribute-value, tuple, and table levels. To address the scalability challenges posed by large RDBs, we further introduce a split-parallel training algorithm that leverages multi-GPU execution for efficient hypergraph learning. Extensive experiments on real-world and benchmark datasets demonstrate that rel-HNN significantly outperforms existing methods in both classification and regression tasks. Moreover, our split-parallel training achieves substantial speedups -- up to 3.18x for learning on relational data and up to 2.94x for hypergraph learning -- compared to conventional single-GPU execution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heat Kernel Goes Topological](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12380v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topological neural networks have emerged as powerful successors of graph neural networks. However, they typically involve higher-order message passing, which incurs significant computational expense. We circumvent this issue with a novel topological framework that introduces a Laplacian operator on combinatorial complexes (CCs), enabling efficient computation of heat kernels that serve as node descriptors. Our approach captures multiscale information and enables permutation-equivariant representations, allowing easy integration into modern transformer-based architectures. Theoretically, the proposed method is maximally expressive because it can distinguish arbitrary non-isomorphic CCs. Empirically, it significantly outperforms existing topological methods in terms of computational efficiency. Besides demonstrating competitive performance with the state-of-the-art descriptors on standard molecular datasets, it exhibits superior capability in distinguishing complex topological structures and avoiding blind spots on topological benchmarks. Overall, this work advances topological deep learning by providing expressive yet scalable representations, thereby opening up exciting avenues for molecular classification and property prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Find Fraudsters? Multi-level LLM Enhanced Graph Fraud Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11997v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph fraud detection has garnered significant attention as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven effective in modeling complex relationships within multimodal data. However, existing graph fraud detection methods typically use preprocessed node embeddings and predefined graph structures to reveal fraudsters, which ignore the rich semantic cues contained in raw textual information. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit powerful capabilities in processing textual information, it remains a significant challenge to perform multimodal fusion of processed textual embeddings with graph structures. In this paper, we propose a \textbf{M}ulti-level \textbf{L}LM \textbf{E}nhanced Graph Fraud \textbf{D}etection framework called MLED. In MLED, we utilize LLMs to extract external knowledge from textual information to enhance graph fraud detection methods. To integrate LLMs with graph structure information and enhance the ability to distinguish fraudsters, we design a multi-level LLM enhanced framework including type-level enhancer and relation-level enhancer. One is to enhance the difference between the fraudsters and the benign entities, the other is to enhance the importance of the fraudsters in different relations. The experiments on four real-world datasets show that MLED achieves state-of-the-art performance in graph fraud detection as a generalized framework that can be applied to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simplifying Graph Kernels for Efficient](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03560v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While kernel methods and Graph Neural Networks offer complementary strengths, integrating the two has posed challenges in efficiency and scalability. The Graph Neural Tangent Kernel provides a theoretical bridge by interpreting GNNs through the lens of neural tangent kernels. However, its reliance on deep, stacked layers introduces repeated computations that hinder performance. In this work, we introduce a new perspective by designing the simplified graph kernel, which replaces deep layer stacking with a streamlined $K$-step message aggregation process. This formulation avoids iterative layer-wise propagation altogether, leading to a more concise and computationally efficient framework without sacrificing the expressive power needed for graph tasks. Beyond this simplification, we propose another Simplified Graph Kernel, which draws from Gaussian Process theory to model infinite-width GNNs. Rather than simulating network depth, this kernel analytically computes kernel values based on the statistical behavior of nonlinear activations in the infinite limit. This eliminates the need for explicit architecture simulation, further reducing complexity. Our experiments on standard graph and node classification benchmarks show that our methods achieve competitive accuracy while reducing runtime. This makes them practical alternatives for learning on graphs at scale.

A large number of classical as well as modern deep learning based algorithms have been proposed for this problem, often having tunable hyperparameters. We initiate a formal study of tuning algorithm hyperparameters from parameterized algorithm families for this problem. We obtain novel $O(\log n)$ pseudo-dimension upper bounds for hyperparameter selection in three classical label propagation-based algorithm families, where $n$ is the number of nodes, implying bounds on the amount of data needed for learning provably good parameters. We further provide matching $\Omega(\log n)$ pseudo-dimension lower bounds, thus asymptotically characterizing the learning-theoretic complexity of the parameter tuning problem. We extend our study to selecting architectural hyperparameters in modern graph neural networks. We bound the Rademacher complexity for tuning the self-loop weighting in recently proposed Simplified Graph Convolution (SGC) networks. We further propose a tunable architecture that interpolates graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) and graph attention networks (GAT) in every layer, and provide Rademacher complexity bounds for tuning the interpolation coefficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages (12 pages main body), 2 figures.

| **[A Graph-in-Graph Learning Framework for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11757v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting drug-target interactions (DTIs) is pivotal for advancing drug discovery and target validation techniques. While machine learning approaches including those that are based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have achieved notable success in DTI prediction, many of them have difficulties in effectively integrating the diverse features of drugs, targets and their interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework to take advantage of the power of both transductive learning and inductive learning so that features at molecular level and drug-target interaction network level can be exploited. Within this framework is a GNN-based model called Graph-in-Graph (GiG) that represents graphs of drug and target molecular structures as meta-nodes in a drug-target interaction graph, enabling a detailed exploration of their intricate relationships. To evaluate the proposed model, we have compiled a special benchmark comprising drug SMILES, protein sequences, and their interaction data, which is interesting in its own right. Our experimental results demonstrate that the GiG model significantly outperforms existing approaches across all evaluation metrics, highlighting the benefits of integrating different learning paradigms and interaction data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks Powered by Encoder Embedding for Improved Node Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11732v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for a wide range of node-level graph learning tasks. However, their performance is often constrained by reliance on random or minimally informed initial feature representations, which can lead to slow convergence and suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we leverage a statistically grounded method, one-hot graph encoder embedding (GEE), to generate high-quality initial node features that enhance the end-to-end training of GNNs. We refer to this integrated framework as the GEE-powered GNN (GG), and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive simulations and real-world experiments across both unsupervised and supervised settings. In node clustering, GG consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, ranking first across all evaluated real-world datasets, while exhibiting faster convergence compared to the standard GNN. For node classification, we further propose an enhanced variant, GG-C, which concatenates the outputs of GG and GEE and outperforms competing baselines. These results confirm the importance of principled, structure-aware feature initialization in realizing the full potential of GNNs.</p></details> |  |

However, these models often rely on all dataset samples being drawn from the same distribution. In addition, graph generative models (GGMs) show a pronounced ability to generate novel output graphs. Despite this, GGM applications remain largely limited to domain-specific tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose FLEX as a GGM framework which leverages two mechanism: (1) structurally-conditioned graph generation, and (2) adversarial co-training between an auto-encoder and GNN. As such, FLEX ensures structural-alignment between sample distributions to enhance link-prediction performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Notably, FLEX does not require expert knowledge to function in different OOD scenarios. Numerous experiments are conducted in synthetic and real-world OOD settings to demonstrate FLEX's performance-enhancing ability, with further analysis for understanding the effects of graph data augmentation on link structures.

However, GNNs may produce biased predictions against certain demographic subgroups due to node attributes and neighbors surrounding a node. Most current research on GNN fairness focuses predominantly on debiasing GNNs using oversimplified fairness evaluation metrics, which can give a misleading impression of fairness. Understanding the potential evaluation paradoxes due to the complicated nature of the graph structure is crucial for developing effective GNN debiasing mechanisms. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of current GNN debiasing methods in terms of unfairness evaluation. Specifically, we introduce a community-level strategy to measure bias in GNNs and evaluate debiasing methods at this level. Further, We introduce ComFairGNN, a novel framework designed to mitigate community-level bias in GNNs. Our approach employs a learnable coreset-based debiasing function that addresses bias arising from diverse local neighborhood distributions during GNNs neighborhood aggregation. Comprehensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate our model's effectiveness in both accuracy and fairness metrics.</p></details> | PAKDD 2025 |
