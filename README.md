| **[PyDPF: A Python Package for Differentiable Particle Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25693v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-space models (SSMs) are a widely used tool in time series analysis. In the complex systems that arise from real-world data, it is common to employ particle filtering (PF), an efficient Monte Carlo method for estimating the hidden state corresponding to a sequence of observations. Applying particle filtering requires specifying both the parametric form and the parameters of the system, which are often unknown and must be estimated. Gradient-based optimisation techniques cannot be applied directly to standard particle filters, as the filters themselves are not differentiable. However, several recently proposed methods modify the resampling step to make particle filtering differentiable. In this paper, we present an implementation of several such differentiable particle filters (DPFs) with a unified API built on the popular PyTorch framework. Our implementation makes these algorithms easily accessible to a broader research community and facilitates straightforward comparison between them. We validate our framework by reproducing experiments from several existing studies and demonstrate how DPFs can be applied to address several common challenges with state space modelling.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 0 figures, under review at the Journal of Statistical Software, the python package can be found at https://pypi.org/project/pydpf/ , the full documentation at https://python-dpf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#documentation-index , and the source code including experiments and replication material at https://github.com/John-JoB/pydpf</p></details> |
| **[ABS: Enforcing Constraint Satisfaction On Generated Sequences Via Automata-Guided Beam Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09701v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequence generation and prediction form a cornerstone of modern machine learning, with applications spanning natural language processing, program synthesis, and time-series forecasting. These tasks are typically modeled in an autoregressive fashion, where each token is generated conditional on the preceding ones, and beam search is commonly used to balance exploration and fluency during decoding. While deep learning models and Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at capturing statistical patterns in this setting, they remain ill-equipped to guarantee compliance with formal constraints. In this paper, we introduce ABS: a general and model-agnostic inference-time algorithm that guarantees compliance with any constraint that can be compiled into a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), without requiring retraining. ABS leverages the DFA to guide a constrained variant of beam search: at each decoding step, transitions leading to violations are masked, while remaining paths are dynamically re-ranked according to both the model's probabilities and the automaton's acceptance structure. We formally prove that the resulting sequences are guaranteed to satisfy the given constraints, and we empirically demonstrate that ABS also improves output quality. We validate our approach on three distinct tasks: constrained image-stream classification, controlled text generation, and text infilling. In all settings, ABS achieves perfect constraint satisfaction, while outperforming or matching state-of-the-art baselines on standard quality metrics and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Virtual Target Trajectory Prediction for Stochastic Targets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01851v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction of aerial vehicles is a key requirement in applications ranging from missile guidance to UAV collision avoidance. While most prediction methods assume deterministic target motion, real-world targets often exhibit stochastic behaviors such as evasive maneuvers or random gliding patterns. This paper introduces a probabilistic framework based on Conditional Normalizing Flows (CNFs) to model and predict such stochastic dynamics directly from trajectory data. The learned model generates probability distributions of future target positions conditioned on initial states and dynamic parameters, enabling efficient sampling and exact density evaluation. To provide deterministic surrogates compatible with existing guidance and planning algorithms, sampled trajectories are clustered using a time series k-means approach, yielding a set of representative "virtual target" trajectories. The method is target-agnostic, computationally efficient, and requires only trajectory data for training, making it suitable as a drop-in replacement for deterministic predictors. Simulated scenarios with maneuvering and ballistic targets demonstrate that the proposed approach bridges the gap between deterministic assumptions and stochastic reality, advancing guidance and control algorithms for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript accepted by Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics</p></details> |
| **[Agentic AI for Mobile Network RAN Management and Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02532v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic AI represents a new paradigm for automating complex systems by using Large AI Models (LAMs) to provide human-level cognitive abilities with multimodal perception, planning, memory, and reasoning capabilities. This will lead to a new generation of AI systems that autonomously decompose goals, retain context over time, learn continuously, operate across tools and environments, and adapt dynamically. The complexity of 5G and upcoming 6G networks renders manual optimization ineffective, pointing to Agentic AI as a method for automating decisions in dynamic RAN environments. However, despite its rapid advances, there is no established framework outlining the foundational components and operational principles of Agentic AI systems nor a universally accepted definition. This paper contributes to ongoing research on Agentic AI in 5G and 6G networks by outlining its core concepts and then proposing a practical use case that applies Agentic principles to RAN optimization. We first introduce Agentic AI, tracing its evolution from classical agents and discussing the progress from workflows and simple AI agents to Agentic AI. Core design patterns-reflection, planning, tool use, and multi-agent collaboration-are then described to illustrate how intelligent behaviors are orchestrated. These theorical concepts are grounded in the context of mobile networks, with a focus on RAN management and optimization. A practical 5G RAN case study shows how time-series analytics and LAM-driven agents collaborate for KPI-based autonomous decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[HAGI++: Head-Assisted Gaze Imputation and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02468v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile eye tracking plays a vital role in capturing human visual attention across both real-world and extended reality (XR) environments, making it an essential tool for applications ranging from behavioural research to human-computer interaction. However, missing values due to blinks, pupil detection errors, or illumination changes pose significant challenges for further gaze data analysis. To address this challenge, we introduce HAGI++ - a multi-modal diffusion-based approach for gaze data imputation that, for the first time, uses the integrated head orientation sensors to exploit the inherent correlation between head and eye movements. HAGI++ employs a transformer-based diffusion model to learn cross-modal dependencies between eye and head representations and can be readily extended to incorporate additional body movements. Extensive evaluations on the large-scale Nymeria, Ego-Exo4D, and HOT3D datasets demonstrate that HAGI++ consistently outperforms conventional interpolation methods and deep learning-based time-series imputation baselines in gaze imputation. Furthermore, statistical analyses confirm that HAGI++ produces gaze velocity distributions that closely match actual human gaze behaviour, ensuring more realistic gaze imputations. Moreover, by incorporating wrist motion captured from commercial wearable devices, HAGI++ surpasses prior methods that rely on full-body motion capture in the extreme case of 100% missing gaze data (pure gaze generation). Our method paves the way for more complete and accurate eye gaze recordings in real-world settings and has significant potential for enhancing gaze-based analysis and interaction across various application domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of our UIST'25 paper "HAGI: Head-Assisted Gaze Imputation for Mobile Eye Trackers"</p></details> |
| **[ReNF: Rethinking the Design Space of Neural Long-Term Time Series Forecasters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25914v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Forecasters (NFs) are a cornerstone of Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF). However, progress has been hampered by an overemphasis on architectural complexity at the expense of fundamental forecasting principles. In this work, we return to first principles to redesign the LTSF paradigm. We begin by introducing a Multiple Neural Forecasting Theorem that provides a theoretical basis for our approach. We propose Boosted Direct Output (BDO), a novel forecasting strategy that synergistically combines the advantages of both Auto-Regressive (AR) and Direct Output (DO). In addition, we stabilize the learning process by smoothly tracking the model's parameters. Extensive experiments show that these principled improvements enable a simple MLP to achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent, complex models in nearly all cases, without any specific considerations in the area. Finally, we empirically verify our theorem, establishing a dynamic performance bound and identifying promising directions for future research.

| **[Human-Machine Ritual: Synergic Performance through Real-Time Motion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02351v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a lightweight, real-time motion recognition system that enables synergic human-machine performance through wearable IMU sensor data, MiniRocket time-series classification, and responsive multimedia control. By mapping dancer-specific movement to sound through somatic memory and association, we propose an alternative approach to human-machine collaboration, one that preserves the expressive depth of the performing body while leveraging machine learning for attentive observation and responsiveness. We demonstrate that this human-centered design reliably supports high accuracy classification (<50 ms latency), offering a replicable framework to integrate dance-literate machines into creative, educational, and live performance contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

| **[WaveStitch: Flexible and Fast Conditional Time Series Generation with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06231v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating temporal data under conditions is crucial for forecasting, imputation, and generative tasks. Such data often has metadata and partially observed signals that jointly influence the generated values. However, existing methods face three key limitations: (1) they condition on either the metadata or observed values, but rarely both together; (2) they adopt either training-time approaches that fail to generalize to unseen scenarios, or inference-time approaches that ignore metadata; and (3) they suffer from trade-offs between generation speed and temporal coherence across time windows--choosing either slow but coherent autoregressive methods or fast but incoherent parallel ones. We propose WaveStitch, a novel diffusion-based method to overcome these hurdles through: (1) dual-sourced conditioning on both metadata and partially observed signals; (2) a hybrid training-inference architecture, incorporating metadata during training and observations at inference via gradient-based guidance; and (3) a novel pipeline-style paradigm that generates time windows in parallel while preserving coherence through an inference-time conditional loss and a stitching mechanism. Across diverse datasets, WaveStitch demonstrates adaptability to arbitrary patterns of observed signals, achieving 1.81x lower mean-squared-error compared to the state-of-the-art, and generates data up to 166.48x faster than autoregressive methods while maintaining coherence.

| **[Federated Quantum Kernel Learning for Anomaly Detection in Multivariate IoT Time-Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02301v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems has created new challenges for anomaly detection in high-dimensional, multivariate time-series, where privacy, scalability, and communication efficiency are critical. Classical federated learning approaches mitigate privacy concerns by enabling decentralized training, but they often struggle with highly non-linear decision boundaries and imbalanced anomaly distributions. To address this gap, we propose a Federated Quantum Kernel Learning (FQKL) framework that integrates quantum feature maps with federated aggregation to enable distributed, privacy-preserving anomaly detection across heterogeneous IoT networks. In our design, quantum edge nodes locally compute compressed kernel statistics using parameterized quantum circuits and share only these summaries with a central server, which constructs a global Gram matrix and trains a decision function (e.g., Fed-QSVM). Experimental results on synthetic IIoT benchmarks demonstrate that FQKL achieves superior generalization in capturing complex temporal correlations compared to classical federated baselines, while significantly reducing communication overhead. This work highlights the promise of quantum kernels in federated settings, advancing the path toward scalable, robust, and quantum-enhanced intelligence for next-generation IoT infrastructures.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Effective Are Time-Series Models for Precipitation Nowcasting? A Comprehensive Benchmark for GNSS-based Precipitation Nowcasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25263v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precipitation Nowcasting, which aims to predict precipitation within the next 0 to 6 hours, is critical for disaster mitigation and real-time response planning. However, most time series forecasting benchmarks in meteorology are evaluated on variables with strong periodicity, such as temperature and humidity, which fail to reflect model capabilities in more complex and practically meteorology scenarios like precipitation nowcasting. To address this gap, we propose RainfallBench, a benchmark designed for precipitation nowcasting, a highly challenging and practically relevant task characterized by zero inflation, temporal decay, and non-stationarity, focusing on predicting precipitation within the next 0 to 6 hours. The dataset is derived from five years of meteorological observations, recorded at hourly intervals across six essential variables, and collected from more than 140 Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations globally. In particular, it incorporates precipitable water vapor (PWV), a crucial indicator of rainfall that is absent in other datasets. We further design specialized evaluation protocols to assess model performance on key meteorological challenges, including multi-scale prediction, multi-resolution forecasting, and extreme rainfall events, benchmarking 17 state-of-the-art models across six major architectures on RainfallBench. Additionally, to address the zero-inflation and temporal decay issues overlooked by existing models, we introduce Bi-Focus Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates domain-specific priors to enhance rainfall time series forecasting. Statistical analysis and ablation studies validate the comprehensiveness of our dataset as well as the superiority of our methodology.</p></details> | 13 pages,11 figures |
| **[End-to-End Probabilistic Framework for Learning with Hard Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07003v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present ProbHardE2E, a probabilistic forecasting framework that incorporates hard operational/physical constraints, and provides uncertainty quantification. Our methodology uses a novel differentiable probabilistic projection layer (DPPL) that can be combined with a wide range of neural network architectures. DPPL allows the model to learn the system in an end-to-end manner, compared to other approaches where constraints are satisfied either through a post-processing step or at inference. ProbHardE2E optimizes a strictly proper scoring rule, without making any distributional assumptions on the target, which enables it to obtain robust distributional estimates (in contrast to existing approaches that generally optimize likelihood-based objectives, which are heavily biased by their distributional assumptions and model choices); and it can incorporate a range of non-linear constraints (increasing the power of modeling and flexibility). We apply ProbHardE2E in learning partial differential equations with uncertainty estimates and to probabilistic time-series forecasting, showcasing it as a broadly applicable general framework that connects these seemingly disparate domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 5 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[ProtoTSNet: Interpretable Multivariate Time Series Classification With Prototypical Parts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02152v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data is one of the most popular data modalities in critical domains such as industry and medicine. The demand for algorithms that not only exhibit high accuracy but also offer interpretability is crucial in such fields, as decisions made there bear significant consequences. In this paper, we present ProtoTSNet, a novel approach to interpretable classification of multivariate time series data, through substantial enhancements to the ProtoPNet architecture. Our method is tailored to overcome the unique challenges of time series analysis, including capturing dynamic patterns and handling varying feature significance. Central to our innovation is a modified convolutional encoder utilizing group convolutions, pre-trainable as part of an autoencoder and designed to preserve and quantify feature importance. We evaluated our model on 30 multivariate time series datasets from the UEA archive, comparing our approach with existing explainable methods as well as non-explainable baselines. Through comprehensive evaluation and ablation studies, we demonstrate that our approach achieves the best performance among ante-hoc explainable methods while maintaining competitive performance with non-explainable and post-hoc explainable approaches, providing interpretable results accessible to domain experts.</p></details> | 30 pages, 10 figures |
| **[DoFlow: Causal Generative Flows for Interventional and Counterfactual Time-Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02137v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting increasingly demands not only accurate observational predictions but also causal forecasting under interventional and counterfactual queries in multivariate systems. We present DoFlow, a flow based generative model defined over a causal DAG that delivers coherent observational and interventional predictions, as well as counterfactuals through the natural encoding and decoding mechanism of continuous normalizing flows (CNFs). We also provide a supporting counterfactual recovery result under certain assumptions. Beyond forecasting, DoFlow provides explicit likelihoods of future trajectories, enabling principled anomaly detection. Experiments on synthetic datasets with various causal DAG and real world hydropower and cancer treatment time series show that DoFlow achieves accurate system-wide observational forecasting, enables causal forecasting over interventional and counterfactual queries, and effectively detects anomalies. This work contributes to the broader goal of unifying causal reasoning and generative modeling for complex dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Missing Values](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23494v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values are common in real-world time series, and multivariate time series forecasting with missing values (MTSF-M) has become a crucial area of research for ensuring reliable predictions. To address the challenge of missing data, current approaches have developed an imputation-then-prediction framework that uses imputation modules to fill in missing values, followed by forecasting on the imputed data. However, this framework overlooks a critical issue: there is no ground truth for the missing values, making the imputation process susceptible to errors that can degrade prediction accuracy. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study and reveal that imputation without direct supervision can corrupt the underlying data distribution and actively degrade prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that moves away from imputation and directly predicts from the partially observed time series. We introduce Consistency-Regularized Information Bottleneck (CRIB), a novel framework built on the Information Bottleneck principle. CRIB combines a unified-variate attention mechanism with a consistency regularization scheme to learn robust representations that filter out noise introduced by missing values while preserving essential predictive signals. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CRIB, which predicts accurately even under high missing rates. Our code is available in https://github.com/Muyiiiii/CRIB.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Literature Review of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network Models for Time Series Forecasting and Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22377v4)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, spatio-temporal graph neural networks (GNNs) have attracted considerable interest in the field of time series analysis, due to their ability to capture, at once, dependencies among variables and across time points. The objective of this systematic literature review is hence to provide a comprehensive overview of the various modeling approaches and application domains of GNNs for time series classification and forecasting. A database search was conducted, and 366 papers were selected for a detailed examination of the current state-of-the-art in the field. This examination is intended to offer to the reader a comprehensive review of proposed models, links to related source code, available datasets, benchmark models, and fitting results. All this information is hoped to assist researchers in their studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and broadest systematic literature review presenting a detailed comparison of results from current spatio-temporal GNN models applied to different domains. In its final part, this review discusses current limitations and challenges in the application of spatio-temporal GNNs, such as comparability, reproducibility, explainability, poor information capacity, and scalability. This paper is complemented by a GitHub repository at https://github.com/FlaGer99/SLR-Spatio-Temporal-GNN.git providing additional interactive tools to further explore the presented findings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Strategy Identification and Subtask Decomposition In Task Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01728v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research builds on work in anticipatory human-machine interaction, a subfield of human-machine interaction where machines can facilitate advantageous interactions by anticipating a user's future state. The aim of this research is to further a machine's understanding of user knowledge, skill, and behavior in pursuit of implicit coordination. A task explorer pipeline was developed that uses clustering techniques, paired with factor analysis and string edit distance, to automatically identify key global and local strategies that are used to complete tasks. Global strategies identify generalized sets of actions used to complete tasks, while local strategies identify sequences that used those sets of actions in a similar composition. Additionally, meaningful subtasks of various lengths are identified within the tasks. The task explorer pipeline was able to automatically identify key strategies used to complete tasks and encode user runs with hierarchical subtask structures. In addition, a Task Explorer application was developed to easily review pipeline results. The task explorer pipeline can be easily modified to any action-based time-series data and the identified strategies and subtasks help to inform humans and machines on user knowledge, skill, and behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forging Time Series with Language: A Large Language Model Approach to Synthetic Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17103v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SDForger is a flexible and efficient framework for generating high-quality multivariate time series using LLMs. Leveraging a compact data representation, SDForger provides synthetic time series generation from a few samples and low-computation fine-tuning of any autoregressive LLM. Specifically, the framework transforms univariate and multivariate signals into tabular embeddings, which are then encoded into text and used to fine-tune the LLM. At inference, new textual embeddings are sampled and decoded into synthetic time series that retain the original data's statistical properties and temporal dynamics. Across a diverse range of datasets, SDForger outperforms existing generative models in many scenarios, both in similarity-based evaluations and downstream forecasting tasks. By enabling textual conditioning in the generation process, SDForger paves the way for multimodal modeling and the streamlined integration of time series with textual information. The model is open-sourced at https://github.com/IBM/fms-dgt/tree/main/fms_dgt/public/databuilders/time_series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theoretical analysis of phase-rectified signal averaging (PRSA) algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01659v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Phase-rectified signal averaging (PRSA) is a widely used algorithm to analyze nonstationary biomedical time series. The method operates by identifying hinge points in the time series according to prescribed rules, extracting segments centered at these points (with overlap permitted), and then averaging the segments. The resulting output is intended to capture the underlying quasi-oscillatory pattern of the signal, which can subsequently serve as input for further scientific analysis. However, a theoretical analysis of PRSA is lacking. In this paper, we investigate PRSA under two settings. First, when the input consists of a superposition of two oscillatory components, $\cos(2\pi t)+A\cos(2\pi (\xi t+\phi))$, where $A>0$, $\xi\in (0,1)$ and $\phi\in [0,1)$, we show that, asymptotically when the sample size $n\to \infty$, the PRSA output takes the form $A'\sin(2\pi t)+B'\sin(2\pi \xi t)$, where $A',B'\neq 0$. Second, when the input is a stationary Gaussian random process, we establish a central limit theorem: under mild regularity conditions, the averaged vector produced by PRSA converges in distribution to a Gaussian random vector as $n\to \infty$ with mean determined by the covariance structure of the random process. These results indicate that caution is warranted when interpreting PRSA outputs for scientific applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Defining Energy Indicators for Impact Identification on Aerospace Composites: A Physics-Informed Machine Learning Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01592v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Energy estimation is critical to impact identification on aerospace composites, where low-velocity impacts can induce internal damage that is undetectable at the surface. Current methodologies for energy prediction are often constrained by data sparsity, signal noise, complex feature interdependencies, non-linear dynamics, massive design spaces, and the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem. This study introduces a physics-informed framework that embeds domain knowledge into machine learning through a dedicated input space. The approach combines observational biases, which guide the design of physics-motivated features, with targeted feature selection to retain only the most informative indicators. Features are extracted from time, frequency, and time-frequency domains to capture complementary aspects of the structural response. A structured feature selection process integrating statistical significance, correlation filtering, dimensionality reduction, and noise robustness ensures physical relevance and interpretability. Exploratory data analysis further reveals domain-specific trends, yielding a reduced feature set that captures essential dynamic phenomena such as amplitude scaling, spectral redistribution, and transient signal behaviour. Together, these steps produce a compact set of energy-sensitive indicators with both statistical robustness and physical significance, resulting in impact energy predictions that remain interpretable and traceable to measurable structural responses. Using this optimised input space, a fully-connected neural network is trained and validated with experimental data from multiple impact scenarios, including pristine and damaged states. The resulting model demonstrates significantly improved impact energy prediction accuracy, reducing errors by a factor of three compared to conventional time-series techniques and purely data-driven models.</p></details> |  |
| **[HIT-ROCKET: Hadamard-vector Inner-product Transformer for ROCKET](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01572v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series classification holds broad application value in communications, information countermeasures, finance, and medicine. However, state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods-including HIVE-COTE, Proximity Forest, and TS-CHIEF-exhibit high computational complexity, coupled with lengthy parameter tuning and training cycles. In contrast, lightweight solutions like ROCKET (Random Convolutional Kernel Transform) offer greater efficiency but leave substantial room for improvement in kernel selection and computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose a feature extraction approach based on Hadamard convolutional transform, utilizing column or row vectors of Hadamard matrices as convolution kernels with extended lengths of varying sizes. This enhancement maintains full compatibility with existing methods (e.g., ROCKET) while leveraging kernel orthogonality to boost computational efficiency, robustness, and adaptability. Comprehensive experiments on multi-domain datasets-focusing on the UCR time series dataset-demonstrate SOTA performance: F1-score improved by at least 5% vs. ROCKET, with 50% shorter training time than miniROCKET (fastest ROCKET variant) under identical hyperparameters, enabling deployment on ultra-low-power embedded devices. All code is available on GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeuroClean: A Generalized Machine-Learning Approach to Neural Time-Series Conditioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01951v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalography (EEG) and local field potentials (LFP) are two widely used techniques to record electrical activity from the brain. These signals are used in both the clinical and research domains for multiple applications. However, most brain data recordings suffer from a myriad of artifacts and noise sources other than the brain itself. Thus, a major requirement for their use is proper and, given current volumes of data, a fully automatized conditioning. As a means to this end, here we introduce an unsupervised, multipurpose EEG/LFP preprocessing method, the NeuroClean pipeline. In addition to its completeness and reliability, NeuroClean is an unsupervised series of algorithms intended to mitigate reproducibility issues and biases caused by human intervention. The pipeline is designed as a five-step process, including the common bandpass and line noise filtering, and bad channel rejection. However, it incorporates an efficient independent component analysis with an automatic component rejection based on a clustering algorithm. This machine learning classifier is used to ensure that task-relevant information is preserved after each step of the cleaning process. We used several data sets to validate the pipeline. NeuroClean removed several common types of artifacts from the signal. Moreover, in the context of motor tasks of varying complexity, it yielded more than 97% accuracy (vs. a chance-level of 33.3%) in an optimized Multinomial Logistic Regression model after cleaning the data, compared to the raw data, which performed at 74% accuracy. These results show that NeuroClean is a promising pipeline and workflow that can be applied to future work and studies to achieve better generalization and performance on machine learning pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Change Point Inference for High Dimensional Time Series with Temporal Dependence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01487v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates change point inference in high-dimensional time series. We begin by introducing a max-$L_2$-norm based test procedure, which demonstrates strong performance under dense alternatives. We then establish the asymptotic independence between our proposed statistic and the two max-$L_\infty$-based statistics introduced by Wang and Feng (2023). Building on this result, we develop an adaptive inference approach by applying the Cauchy combination method to integrate these tests. This combined procedure exhibits robust performance across varying levels of sparsity. Extensive simulation studies and real data analysis further confirm the superior effectiveness of our proposed methods in the high-dimensional setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[50 Years of Water Body Monitoring: The Case of Qaraaoun Reservoir, Lebanon](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24413v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sustainable management of the Qaraaoun Reservoir, the largest surface water body in Lebanon located in the Bekaa Plain, depends on reliable monitoring of its storage volume despite frequent sensor malfunctions and limited maintenance capacity. This study introduces a sensor-free approach that integrates open-source satellite imagery, advanced water-extent segmentation, and machine learning to estimate the reservoir's surface area and, subsequently, its volume in near real time. Sentinel-2 and Landsat 1-9 images are processed, where surface water is delineated using a newly proposed water segmentation index. A machine learning model based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) is trained on a curated dataset that includes water surface area, water level, and water volume derived from a reservoir bathymetric survey. The model is then able to estimate the water body's volume solely from the extracted water surface, without the need for any ground-based measurements. Water segmentation using the proposed index aligns with ground truth for over 95% of the shoreline. Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV yields an optimized SVR performance, with an error below 1.5% of the full reservoir capacity and coefficients of determination exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate the method's robustness and cost-effectiveness, offering a practical solution for continuous, sensor-independent monitoring of reservoir storage. The proposed methodology is applicable to other water bodies and generates over five decades of time-series data, offering valuable insights into climate change and environmental dynamics, with an emphasis on capturing temporal trends rather than exact water volume measurements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Spatio-Temporal Attention Networks for Epileptic Seizure Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01275v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting epileptic seizures from multivariate EEG signals represents a critical challenge in healthcare time series prediction, requiring high sensitivity, low false alarm rates, and subject-specific adaptability. We present STAN, an Adversarial Spatio-Temporal Attention Network that jointly models spatial brain connectivity and temporal neural dynamics through cascaded attention blocks with alternating spatial and temporal modules. Unlike existing approaches that assume fixed preictal durations or separately process spatial and temporal features, STAN captures bidirectional dependencies between spatial and temporal patterns through a unified cascaded architecture. Adversarial training with gradient penalty enables robust discrimination between interictal and preictal states learned from clearly defined 15-minute preictal windows. Continuous 90-minute pre-seizure monitoring reveals that the learned spatio-temporal attention patterns enable early detection: reliable alarms trigger at subject-specific times (typically 15-45 minutes before onset), reflecting the model's capacity to capture subtle preictal dynamics without requiring individualized training. Experiments on two benchmark EEG datasets (CHB-MIT scalp: 8 subjects, 46 events; MSSM intracranial: 4 subjects, 14 events) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: 96.6% sensitivity with 0.011 false detections per hour and 94.2% sensitivity with 0.063 false detections per hour, respectively, while maintaining computational efficiency (2.3M parameters, 45 ms latency, 180 MB memory) for real-time edge deployment. Beyond epilepsy, the proposed framework provides a general paradigm for spatio-temporal forecasting in healthcare and other time series domains where individual heterogeneity and interpretability are crucial.</p></details> |  |

These models rely on patching the time series and learning relationships between raw temporal data blocks. We argue that this approach is blind to critical, non-obvious high-frequency information that is complementary to the temporal dynamics. In this letter, we propose Hi-WaveTST, a novel Hybrid architecture that augments the original temporal patch with a learnable, High-Frequency wavelet feature stream. Our wavelet stream uses a deep Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) on each patch and extracts features using a learnable Generalized Mean (GeM) pooling layer. On the UCI-HAR benchmark dataset, our hybrid model achieves a mean accuracy of 93.38 percent plus-minus 0.0043, significantly outperforming the SOTA PatchTST baseline (92.59 percent plus-minus 0.0039). A comprehensive ablation study proves that every component of our design-the hybrid architecture, the deep high-frequency wavelet decomposition, and the learnable GeM pooling-is essential for this state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

Despite decades of research and numerous imputation methods, the literature remains fragmented across fields, creating a critical need for a comprehensive synthesis that connects statistical foundations with modern machine learning advances. This work systematically reviews core concepts-including missingness mechanisms, single versus multiple imputation, and different imputation goals-and examines problem characteristics across various domains. It provides a thorough categorization of imputation methods, spanning classical techniques (e.g., regression, the EM algorithm) to modern approaches like low-rank and high-rank matrix completion, deep learning models (autoencoders, GANs, diffusion models, graph neural networks), and large language models. Special attention is given to methods for complex data types, such as tensors, time series, streaming data, graph-structured data, categorical data, and multimodal data. Beyond methodology, we investigate the crucial integration of imputation with downstream tasks like classification, clustering, and anomaly detection, examining both sequential pipelines and joint optimization frameworks. The review also assesses theoretical guarantees, benchmarking resources, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we identify critical challenges and future directions, emphasizing model selection and hyperparameter optimization, the growing importance of privacy-preserving imputation via federated learning, and the pursuit of generalizable models that can adapt across domains and data types, thereby outlining a roadmap for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[OneCast: Structured Decomposition and Modular Generation for Cross-Domain Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24028v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain time series forecasting is a valuable task in various web applications. Despite its rapid advancement, achieving effective generalization across heterogeneous time series data remains a significant challenge. Existing methods have made progress by extending single-domain models, yet often fall short when facing domain-specific trend shifts and inconsistent periodic patterns. We argue that a key limitation lies in treating temporal series as undifferentiated sequence, without explicitly decoupling their inherent structural components. To address this, we propose OneCast, a structured and modular forecasting framework that decomposes time series into seasonal and trend components, each modeled through tailored generative pathways. Specifically, the seasonal component is captured by a lightweight projection module that reconstructs periodic patterns via interpretable basis functions. In parallel, the trend component is encoded into discrete tokens at segment level via a semantic-aware tokenizer, and subsequently inferred through a masked discrete diffusion mechanism. The outputs from both branches are combined to produce a final forecast that captures seasonal patterns while tracking domain-specific trends. Extensive experiments across eight domains demonstrate that OneCast mostly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

While many systems have recently been developed to handle this form of evidence, their evaluation remains limited by existing datasets, which often lack structured evidence, provide insufficient justifications for verdicts, or rely on synthetic claims. In this paper, we introduce TSVer, a new benchmark dataset for fact verification focusing on temporal and numerical reasoning with time-series evidence. TSVer contains 287 real-world claims sourced from 38 fact-checking organizations and a curated database of 400 time series covering diverse domains. Each claim is annotated with time frames across all pertinent time series, along with a verdict and justifications reflecting how the evidence is used to reach the verdict. Using an LLM-assisted multi-step annotation process, we improve the quality of our annotations and achieve an inter-annotator agreement of kappa=0.745 on verdicts. We also develop a baseline for verifying claims against time-series evidence and show that even the state-of-the-art reasoning models like Gemini-2.5-Pro are challenged by time series, achieving a 63.37 accuracy score on verdicts and an Ev2R score of 48.63 on verdict justifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Survey of Reasoning and Agentic Systems in Time Series with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11575v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series reasoning treats time as a first-class axis and incorporates intermediate evidence directly into the answer. This survey defines the problem and organizes the literature by reasoning topology with three families: direct reasoning in one step, linear chain reasoning with explicit intermediates, and branch-structured reasoning that explores, revises, and aggregates. The topology is crossed with the main objectives of the field, including traditional time series analysis, explanation and understanding, causal inference and decision making, and time series generation, while a compact tag set spans these axes and captures decomposition and verification, ensembling, tool use, knowledge access, multimodality, agent loops, and LLM alignment regimes. Methods and systems are reviewed across domains, showing what each topology enables and where it breaks down in faithfulness or robustness, along with curated datasets, benchmarks, and resources that support study and deployment (https://github.com/blacksnail789521/Time-Series-Reasoning-Survey). Evaluation practices that keep evidence visible and temporally aligned are highlighted, and guidance is distilled on matching topology to uncertainty, grounding with observable artifacts, planning for shift and streaming, and treating cost and latency as design budgets. We emphasize that reasoning structures must balance capacity for grounding and self-correction against computational cost and reproducibility, while future progress will likely depend on benchmarks that tie reasoning quality to utility and on closed-loop testbeds that trade off cost and risk under shift-aware, streaming, and long-horizon settings. Taken together, these directions mark a shift from narrow accuracy toward reliability at scale, enabling systems that not only analyze but also understand, explain, and act on dynamic worlds with traceable evidence and credible outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review</p></details> |

Standard Dirichlet time series models assume constant precision and therefore miss these episodes. We introduce B-DARMA-DARCH, a Bayesian Dirichlet autoregressive moving average model with a Dirichlet ARCH component, which lets the precision parameter follow an ARMA recursion. The specification preserves the Dirichlet likelihood so forecasts remain valid compositions while capturing clustered volatility. Simulations and out-of-sample tests show that B-DARMA-DARCH lowers forecast error and improves interval calibration relative to Dirichlet ARMA and log-ratio VARMA benchmarks, providing a concise framework for settings where both the level and the volatility of proportions matter.</p></details> |  |

The article presents SliceVision-F2I, a dataset of synthetic samples for studying feature visualization in network slicing for next-generation networking systems. The dataset transforms multivariate Key Performance Indicator (KPI) vectors into visual representations through four distinct encoding methods: physically inspired mappings, Perlin noise, neural wallpapering, and fractal branching. For each encoding method, 30,000 samples are generated, each comprising a raw KPI vector and a corresponding RGB image at low-resolution pixels. The dataset simulates realistic and noisy network conditions to reflect operational uncertainties and measurement imperfections. SliceVision-F2I is suitable for tasks involving visual learning, network state classification, anomaly detection, and benchmarking of image-based machine learning techniques applied to network data. The dataset is publicly available and can be reused in various research contexts, including multivariate time series analysis, synthetic data generation, and feature-to-image transformations.</p></details> |  |
| **[TiRex: Zero-Shot Forecasting Across Long and Short Horizons with Enhanced In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23719v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning, the ability of large language models to perform tasks using only examples provided in the prompt, has recently been adapted for time series forecasting. This paradigm enables zero-shot prediction, where past values serve as context for forecasting future values, making powerful forecasting tools accessible to non-experts and increasing the performance when training data are scarce. Most existing zero-shot forecasting approaches rely on transformer architectures, which, despite their success in language, often fall short of expectations in time series forecasting, where recurrent models like LSTMs frequently have the edge. Conversely, while LSTMs are well-suited for time series modeling due to their state-tracking capabilities, they lack strong in-context learning abilities. We introduce TiRex that closes this gap by leveraging xLSTM, an enhanced LSTM with competitive in-context learning skills. Unlike transformers, state-space models, or parallelizable RNNs such as RWKV, TiRex retains state-tracking, a critical property for long-horizon forecasting. To further facilitate its state-tracking ability, we propose a training-time masking strategy called CPM. TiRex sets a new state of the art in zero-shot time series forecasting on the HuggingFace benchmarks GiftEval and Chronos-ZS, outperforming significantly larger models including TabPFN-TS (Prior Labs), Chronos Bolt (Amazon), TimesFM (Google), and Moirai (Salesforce) across both short- and long-term forecasts.</p></details> | <details><summary>prese...</summary><p>presented at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Hydra: Dual Exponentiated Memory for Multivariate Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00989v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, effectively modeling multivariate time series has gained significant popularity, mainly due to its wide range of applications, ranging from healthcare to financial markets and energy management. Transformers, MLPs, and linear models as the de facto backbones of modern time series models have shown promising results in single-variant and/or short-term forecasting. These models, however: (1) are permutation equivariant and so lack temporal inductive bias, being less expressive to capture the temporal dynamics; (2) are naturally designed for univariate setup, missing the inter-dependencies of temporal and variate dimensions; and/or (3) are inefficient for Long-term time series modeling. To overcome training and inference efficiency as well as the lack of temporal inductive bias, recently, linear Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have gained attention as an alternative to Transformer-based models. These models, however, are inherently limited to a single sequence, missing inter-variate dependencies, and can propagate errors due to their additive nature. In this paper, we present Hydra, a by-design two-headed meta in-context memory module that learns how to memorize patterns at test time by prioritizing time series patterns that are more informative about the data. Hydra uses a 2-dimensional recurrence across both time and variate at each step, which is more powerful than mixing methods. Although the 2-dimensional nature of the model makes its training recurrent and non-parallelizable, we present a new 2D-chunk-wise training algorithm that approximates the actual recurrence with $\times 10$ efficiency improvement, while maintaining the effectiveness. Our experimental results on a diverse set of tasks and datasets, including time series forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection show the superior performance of Hydra compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

| **[Enhancing Sequential Model Performance with Squared Sigmoid TanH (SST) Activation Under Data Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09034v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Activation functions enable neural networks to learn complex representations by introducing non-linearities. While feedforward models commonly use rectified linear units, sequential models like recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units (GRUs) still rely on Sigmoid and TanH activation functions. However, these classical activation functions often struggle to model sparse patterns when trained on small sequential datasets to effectively capture temporal dependencies. To address this limitation, we propose squared Sigmoid TanH (SST) activation specifically tailored to enhance the learning capability of sequential models under data constraints. SST applies mathematical squaring to amplify differences between strong and weak activations as signals propagate over time, facilitating improved gradient flow and information filtering. We evaluate SST-powered LSTMs and GRUs for diverse applications, such as sign language recognition, regression, and time-series classification tasks, where the dataset is limited. Our experiments demonstrate that SST models consistently outperform RNN-based models with baseline activations, exhibiting improved test accuracy.</p></details> | 10 pages,9 figures |
| **[SST: Multi-Scale Hybrid Mamba-Transformer Experts for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14757v3)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting has made significant advances, including with Transformer-based models. The attention mechanism in Transformer effectively captures temporal dependencies by attending to all past inputs simultaneously. However, its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length limits the scalability for long-range modeling. Recent state space models (SSMs) such as Mamba offer a promising alternative by achieving linear complexity without attention. Yet, Mamba compresses historical information into a fixed-size latent state, potentially causing information loss and limiting representational effectiveness. This raises a key research question: Can we design a hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture that is both effective and efficient for time series forecasting? To address it, we adapt a hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture Mambaformer, originally proposed for language modeling, to the time series domain. Preliminary experiments reveal that naively stacking Mamba and Transformer layers in Mambaformer is suboptimal for time series forecasting, due to an information interference problem. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a new time series decomposition strategy that separates time series into long-range patterns and short-range variations. Then we show that Mamba excels at capturing long-term structures, while Transformer is more effective at modeling short-term dynamics. Building on this insight, we propose State Space Transformer (SST), a multi-scale hybrid model with expert modules: a Mamba expert for long-range patterns and a Transformer expert for short-term variations. SST also employs a multi-scale patching mechanism to adaptively adjust time series resolution: low resolution for long-term patterns and high resolution for short-term variations. Experiments show that SST obtains SOTA performance with linear scalability. The code is at https://github.com/XiongxiaoXu/SST.</p></details> | CIKM 2025 |
| **[Effective Series Decomposition and Components Learning for Time Series Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00747v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series generation focuses on modeling the underlying data distribution and resampling to produce authentic time series data. Key components, such as trend and seasonality, drive temporal fluctuations, yet many existing approaches fail to employ interpretative decomposition methods, limiting their ability to synthesize meaningful trend and seasonal patterns. To address this gap, we introduce Seasonal-Trend Diffusion (STDiffusion), a novel framework for multivariate time series generation that integrates diffusion probabilistic models with advanced learnable series decomposition techniques, enhancing the interpretability of the generation process. Our approach separates the trend and seasonal learning into distinct blocks: a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) structure captures the trend, while adaptive wavelet distillation facilitates effective multi-resolution learning of seasonal components. This decomposition improves the interpretability of the model on multiple scales. In addition, we designed a comprehensive correction mechanism aimed at ensuring that the generated components exhibit a high degree of internal consistency and preserve meaningful interrelationships with one another. Our empirical studies on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that STDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in time series generation tasks. Furthermore, we extend the model's application to multi-window long-sequence time series generation, which delivered reliable results and highlighted its robustness and versatility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2025).

Privacy-aware synthetic time series generation addresses this challenge by enforcing noise during training, inherently introducing a trade-off between privacy and utility. In many cases, sensitive sequences is correlated with publicly available, non-sensitive contextual metadata (e.g., household electricity consumption may be influenced by weather conditions and electricity prices). However, existing privacy-aware data generation methods often overlook this opportunity, resulting in suboptimal privacy-utility trade-offs. In this paper, we present Pub2Priv, a novel framework for generating private time series data by leveraging heterogeneous public knowledge. Our model employs a self-attention mechanism to encode public data into temporal and feature embeddings, which serve as conditional inputs for a diffusion model to generate synthetic private sequences. Additionally, we introduce a practical metric to assess privacy by evaluating the identifiability of the synthetic data. Experimental results show that Pub2Priv consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in improving the privacy-utility trade-off across finance, energy, and commodity trading domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)</p></details> |

Despite significant advancements in deep learning, the theoretical understanding of how and why complex architectures function remains limited, prompting the need for more interpretable models. Recently, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been proposed as a more interpretable alternative to deep learning. While KAN-related research is significantly rising, to date, the study of KAN architectures for time series classification has been limited. In this paper, we aim to conduct a comprehensive and robust exploration of the KAN architecture for time series classification utilising 117 datasets from UCR benchmark archive, from multiple different domains. More specifically, we investigate a) the transferability of reference architectures designed for regression to classification tasks, b) identifying the hyperparameter and implementation configurations for an architecture that best generalizes across 117 datasets, c) the associated complexity trade-offs and d) evaluate KANs interpretability. Our results demonstrate that (1) the Efficient KAN outperforms MLPs in both performance and training times, showcasing its suitability for classification tasks. (2) Efficient KAN exhibits greater stability than the original KAN across grid sizes, depths, and layer configurations, especially when lower learning rates are employed. (3) KAN achieves competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models such as HIVE-COTE2 and InceptionTime, while maintaining smaller architectures and faster training times, highlighting its favorable balance of performance and transparency. (4) The interpretability of the KAN model, as confirmed by SHAP analysis, reinforces its capacity for transparent decision-making.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional lead-lag detection methods are limited by their reliance on statistical analysis methods and by the assumption of persistent lead-lag patterns, which are often invalid in dynamic market conditions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{DeltaLag}, the first end-to-end deep learning method that discovers and exploits dynamic lead-lag structures with pair-specific lag values in financial markets for portfolio construction. Specifically, DeltaLag employs a sparsified cross-attention mechanism to identify relevant lead-lag pairs. These lead-lag signals are then leveraged to extract lag-aligned raw features from the leading stocks for predicting the lagger stock's future return. Empirical evaluations show that DeltaLag substantially outperforms both fixed-lag and self-lead-lag baselines. In addition, its adaptive mechanism for identifying lead-lag relationships consistently surpasses precomputed lead-lag graphs based on statistical methods. Furthermore, DeltaLag outperforms a wide range of temporal and spatio-temporal deep learning models designed for stock prediction or time series forecasting, offering both better trading performance and enhanced interpretability.</p></details> |  |

However, there is considerable risk of poor performance when deployed in practical measurement scenarios leading to negative patient outcomes. Reliable uncertainties accompanying predictions can provide guidance to clinicians in their interpretation of the trustworthiness of model outputs. It is therefore of interest to compare the effectiveness of different approaches. Here we implement an unprecedented set of eight uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques to models trained on two clinically relevant prediction tasks: Atrial Fibrillation (AF) detection (classification), and two variants of blood pressure regression. We formulate a comprehensive evaluation procedure to enable a rigorous comparison of these approaches. We observe a complex picture of uncertainty reliability across the different techniques, where the most optimal for a given task depends on the chosen expression of uncertainty, evaluation metric, and scale of reliability assessed. We find that assessing local calibration and adaptivity provides practically relevant insights about model behaviour that otherwise cannot be acquired using more commonly implemented global reliability metrics. We emphasise that criteria for evaluating UQ techniques should cater to the model's practical use case, where the use of a small number of measurements per patient places a premium on achieving small-scale reliability for the chosen expression of uncertainty, while preserving as much predictive performance as possible.</p></details> |  |

These improvements make xLSTM suitable for time-series prediction tasks as they exhibit the ability to model long-term temporal dependencies better than LSTMs. Despite their potential, these xLSTM-based models remain largely unexplored in the context of vehicle trajectory prediction. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel xLSTM-based vehicle trajectory prediction framework, X-TRAJ, and its physics-aware variant, X-TRACK (eXtended LSTM for TRAjectory prediction Constraint by Kinematics), which explicitly integrates vehicle motion kinematics into the model learning process. By introducing physical constraints, the proposed model generates realistic and feasible trajectories. A comprehensive evaluation on the highD and NGSIM datasets demonstrates that X-TRACK outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

It integrates integer-only quantization and Quantization-Aware Training with optimized hardware designs to realize 6-bit and 4-bit quantized Transformer models, which achieved precision comparable to 8-bit quantized models from related research. Utilizing a complete implementation on an embedded FPGA (Xilinx Spartan-7 XC7S15), we examine the feasibility of deploying Transformer models on embedded IoT devices. This includes a thorough analysis of achievable precision, resource utilization, timing, power, and energy consumption for on-device inference. Our results indicate that while sufficient performance can be attained, the optimization process is not trivial. For instance, reducing the quantization bitwidth does not consistently result in decreased latency or energy consumption, underscoring the necessity of systematically exploring various optimization combinations. Compared to an 8-bit quantized Transformer model in related studies, our 4-bit quantized Transformer model increases test loss by only 0.63%, operates up to 132.33x faster, and consumes 48.19x less energy.

| **[Evaluating Simplification Algorithms for Interpretability of Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08846v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce metrics to evaluate the use of simplified time series in the context of interpretability of a TSC -- a Time Series Classifier. Such simplifications are important because time series data, in contrast to text and image data, are not intuitively under- standable to humans. These metrics are related to the complexity of the simplifications -- how many segments they contain -- and to their loyalty -- how likely they are to maintain the classification of the original time series. We focus on simplifications that select a subset of the original data points, and show that these typically have high Shapley value, thereby aiding interpretability. We employ these metrics to experimentally evaluate four distinct simplification algorithms, across several TSC algorithms and across datasets of varying characteristics, from seasonal or stationary to short or long. We subsequently perform a human-grounded evaluation with forward simulation, that confirms also the practical utility of the introduced metrics to evaluate the use of simplifications in the context of interpretability of TSC. Our findings are summarized in a framework for deciding, for a given TSC, if the various simplifications are likely to aid in its interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reducing Robotic Upper-Limb Assessment Time While Maintaining Precision: A Time Series Foundation Model Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00193v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Visually Guided Reaching (VGR) on the Kinarm robot yields sensitive kinematic biomarkers but requires 40-64 reaches, imposing time and fatigue burdens. We evaluate whether time-series foundation models can replace unrecorded trials from an early subset of reaches while preserving the reliability of standard Kinarm parameters. Methods: We analyzed VGR speed signals from 461 stroke and 599 control participants across 4- and 8-target reaching protocols. We withheld all but the first 8 or 16 reaching trials and used ARIMA, MOMENT, and Chronos models, fine-tuned on 70 percent of subjects, to forecast synthetic trials. We recomputed four kinematic features of reaching (reaction time, movement time, posture speed, maximum speed) on combined recorded plus forecasted trials and compared them to full-length references using ICC(2,1). Results: Chronos forecasts restored ICC >= 0.90 for all parameters with only 8 recorded trials plus forecasts, matching the reliability of 24-28 recorded reaches (Delta ICC <= 0.07). MOMENT yielded intermediate gains, while ARIMA improvements were minimal. Across cohorts and protocols, synthetic trials replaced reaches without materially compromising feature reliability. Conclusion: Foundation-model forecasting can greatly shorten Kinarm VGR assessment time. For the most impaired stroke survivors, sessions drop from 4-5 minutes to about 1 minute while preserving kinematic precision. This forecast-augmented paradigm promises efficient robotic evaluations for assessing motor impairments following stroke.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents TempoPFN, a univariate time series foundation model based on linear Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data. The model uses a GatedDeltaProduct architecture with state-weaving for fully parallelizable training across sequence lengths, eliminating the need for windowing or summarization techniques while maintaining robust temporal state-tracking. Our comprehensive synthetic data pipeline unifies diverse generators, including stochastic differential equations, Gaussian processes, and audio synthesis, with novel augmentations. In zero-shot evaluations on the Gift-Eval benchmark, TempoPFN achieves top-tier competitive performance, outperforming all existing synthetic-only approaches and surpassing the vast majority of models trained on real-world data, while being more efficient than existing baselines by leveraging fully parallelizable training and inference. We open-source our complete data generation pipeline and training code, providing a reproducible foundation for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 18 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |
| **[Centered MA Dirichlet ARMA for Financial Compositions: Theory & Empirical Evidence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18903v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Observation-driven Dirichlet models for compositional time series commonly use the additive log-ratio (ALR) link and include a moving-average (MA) term based on ALR residuals. In the standard Bayesian Dirichlet Auto-Regressive Moving-Average (B-DARMA) recursion, this MA regressor has a nonzero conditional mean under the Dirichlet likelihood, which biases the mean path and complicates interpretation of the MA coefficients. We propose a minimal change: replace the raw regressor with a centered innovation equal to the ALR residual minus its conditional expectation, computable in closed form using digamma functions. Centering restores mean-zero innovations for the MA block without altering either the likelihood or the ALR link. We provide closed-form identities for the conditional mean and forecast recursion, show first-order equivalence to a digamma-link DARMA while retaining a simple inverse back to the mean composition, and supply ready-to-use code. In a weekly application to the Federal Reserve H.8 bank-asset composition, the centered specification improves log predictive scores with virtually identical point accuracy and markedly cleaner Hamiltonian Monte Carlo diagnostics.</p></details> |  |
| **[MapSAM2: Adapting SAM2 for Automatic Segmentation of Historical Map Images and Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27547v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Historical maps are unique and valuable archives that document geographic features across different time periods. However, automated analysis of historical map images remains a significant challenge due to their wide stylistic variability and the scarcity of annotated training data. Constructing linked spatio-temporal datasets from historical map time series is even more time-consuming and labor-intensive, as it requires synthesizing information from multiple maps. Such datasets are essential for applications such as dating buildings, analyzing the development of road networks and settlements, studying environmental changes etc. We present MapSAM2, a unified framework for automatically segmenting both historical map images and time series. Built on a visual foundation model, MapSAM2 adapts to diverse segmentation tasks with few-shot fine-tuning. Our key innovation is to treat both historical map images and time series as videos. For images, we process a set of tiles as a video, enabling the memory attention mechanism to incorporate contextual cues from similar tiles, leading to improved geometric accuracy, particularly for areal features. For time series, we introduce the annotated Siegfried Building Time Series Dataset and, to reduce annotation costs, propose generating pseudo time series from single-year maps by simulating common temporal transformations. Experimental results show that MapSAM2 learns temporal associations effectively and can accurately segment and link buildings in time series under limited supervision or using pseudo videos. We will release both our dataset and code to support future research.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate the applicability a recently proposed time series classification foundation model, to a different EEG tasks such as motor imagery classification and sleep stage prediction. We test two pretraining regimes: (a) pretraining on heterogeneous real-world time series from multiple domains, and (b) pretraining on purely synthetic data. We find that both variants yield strong performance, consistently outperforming EEGNet, a widely used convolutional baseline, and CBraMod, the most recent EEG-specific foundation model. These results suggest that generalist time series foundation models, even when pretrained on data of non-neural origin or on synthetic signals, can transfer effectively to EEG. Our findings highlight the promise of leveraging cross-domain pretrained models for brain signal analysis, suggesting that EEG may benefit from advances in the broader time series literature.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a robust fuzzy clustering framework in the spectral domain that leverages Kendall's tau-based canonical coherence to extract frequency-specific monotonic relationships across variables. Our method takes advantage of dominant frequency-based cross-regional connectivity patterns to improve clustering accuracy while remaining resilient to outliers, making the approach broadly applicable to noisy, high-dimensional MTS. Each series is projected onto vectors generated from a spectral matrix specifically tailored to capture the underlying fuzzy partitions. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over existing methods. As a flagship application, we analyze electroencephalogram recordings, where our approach uncovers frequency- and connectivity-specific markers of latent cognitive states such as alertness and drowsiness, revealing discriminative patterns and ambiguous transitions.</p></details> |  |

We propose MedM2T, a time-aware multimodal framework designed to address these complexities. MedM2T integrates: (i) Sparse Time Series Encoder to flexibly handle irregular and sparse time series, (ii) Hierarchical Time-Aware Fusion to capture both micro- and macro-temporal patterns from multiple dense time series, such as ECGs, and (iii) Bi-Modal Attention to extract cross-modal interactions, which can be extended to any number of modalities. To mitigate granularity gaps between modalities, MedM2T uses modality-specific pre-trained encoders and aligns resulting features within a shared encoder. We evaluated MedM2T on MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-IV-ECG datasets for three tasks that encompass chronic and acute disease dynamics: 90-day cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction, in-hospital mortality prediction, and ICU length-of-stay (LOS) regression. MedM2T outperformed state-of-the-art multimodal learning frameworks and existing time series models, achieving an AUROC of 0.947 and an AUPRC of 0.706 for CVD prediction; an AUROC of 0.901 and an AUPRC of 0.558 for mortality prediction; and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.31 for LOS regression. These results highlight the robustness and broad applicability of MedM2T, positioning it as a promising tool in clinical prediction. We provide the implementation of MedM2T at https://github.com/DHLab-TSENG/MedM2T.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint version of the manuscript has been submitted to the IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (JBHI) for review.

| **[Modeling US Climate Policy Uncertainty: From Causal Identification to Probabilistic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12276v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately forecasting Climate Policy Uncertainty (CPU) is critical for designing effective climate strategies that balance economic growth with environmental objectives. Elevated CPU levels deter investment in green technologies, delay regulatory implementation, and amplify public resistance to policy reforms, particularly during economic stress. Despite the growing literature highlighting the economic relevance of CPU, the mechanisms through which macroeconomic and financial conditions influence its fluctuations remain insufficiently explored. This study addresses this gap by integrating four complementary causal inference techniques to identify statistically and economically significant determinants of the United States (US) CPU index. Impulse response analysis confirms their dynamic effects on CPU, highlighting the role of housing market activity, credit conditions, and financial market sentiment in shaping CPU fluctuations. The identified predictors, along with sentiment based Google Trends indicators, are incorporated into a Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) framework for probabilistic forecasting. The inclusion of Google Trends data captures behavioral and attention based dynamics, leading to notable improvements in forecast accuracy. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of BSTS over state of the art classical and modern architectures for medium and long term forecasts, which are most relevant for climate policy implementation. The feature importance plot provides evidence that the spike-and-slab prior mechanism provides interpretable variable selection. The credible intervals quantify forecast uncertainty, thereby enhancing the model's transparency and policy relevance by enabling strategic decision making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deciphering Invariant Feature Decoupling in Source-free Time Series Forecasting with Proxy Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05589v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of mobile devices generates a massive volume of time series across various domains, where effective time series forecasting enables a variety of real-world applications. This study focuses on a new problem of source-free domain adaptation for time series forecasting. It aims to adapt a pretrained model from sufficient source time series to the sparse target time series domain without access to the source data, embracing data protection regulations. To achieve this, we propose TimePD, the first source-free time series forecasting framework with proxy denoising, where large language models (LLMs) are employed to benefit from their generalization capabilities. Specifically, TimePD consists of three key components: (1) dual-branch invariant disentangled feature learning that enforces representation- and gradient-wise invariance by means of season-trend decomposition; (2) lightweight, parameter-free proxy denoising that dynamically calibrates systematic biases of LLMs; and (3) knowledge distillation that bidirectionally aligns the denoised prediction and the original target prediction. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets offer insight into the effectiveness of the proposed TimePD, outperforming SOTA baselines by 9.3% on average.</p></details> |  |

The system enhances quality control, predictive maintenance, and real-time anomaly detection for telescope operations. Methods: ServiMon integrates cloud-native technologies-including Prometheus, Grafana, Cassandra, Kafka, and InfluxDB-for telemetry collection and processing. It employs machine learning algorithms, notably Isolation Forest, to detect anomalies in Cassandra performance metrics. Key indicators such as read/write latency, throughput, and memory usage are continuously monitored, stored as time-series data, and preprocessed for feature engineering. Anomalies detected by the model are logged in InfluxDB v2 and accessed via Flux for real-time monitoring and visualization. Results: AI-based anomaly detection increases system resilience by identifying performance degradation at an early stage, minimizing downtime, and optimizing telescope operations. Additionally, ServiMon supports astrostatistical analysis by correlating telemetry with observational data, thus enhancing scientific data quality. AI-generated alerts also improve real-time monitoring, enabling proactive system management. Conclusion: ServiMon's scalable framework proves effective for predictive maintenance and real-time monitoring of astronomical infrastructures. By leveraging cloud and edge computing, it is adaptable to future large-scale experiments, optimizing both performance and cost. The combination of machine learning and big data analytics makes ServiMon a robust and flexible solution for modern and next-generation observational astronomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IAU Symposium 397: Exploring the Universe with Artificial Intelligence (UniversAI 2025), Cambridge University Press.

| **[SVTime: Small Time Series Forecasting Models Informed by "Physics" of Large Vision Model Forecasters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09780v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series AI is crucial for analyzing dynamic web content, driving a surge of pre-trained large models known for their strong knowledge encoding and transfer capabilities across diverse tasks. However, given their energy-intensive training, inference, and hardware demands, using large models as a one-fits-all solution raises serious concerns about carbon footprint and sustainability. For a specific task, a compact yet specialized, high-performing model may be more practical and affordable, especially for resource-constrained users such as small businesses. This motivates the question: Can we build cost-effective lightweight models with large-model-like performance on core tasks such as forecasting? This paper addresses this question by introducing SVTime, a novel Small model inspired by large Vision model (LVM) forecasters for long-term Time series forecasting (LTSF). Recently, LVMs have been shown as powerful tools for LTSF. We identify a set of key inductive biases of LVM forecasters -- analogous to the "physics" governing their behaviors in LTSF -- and design small models that encode these biases through meticulously crafted linear layers and constraint functions. Across 21 baselines spanning lightweight, complex, and pre-trained large models on 8 benchmark datasets, SVTime outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight models and rivals large models with 10^3 fewer parameters than LVMs, while enabling efficient training and inference in low-resource settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Modal View Enhanced Large Vision Models for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24003v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series, typically represented as numerical sequences, can also be transformed into images and texts, offering multi-modal views (MMVs) of the same underlying signal. These MMVs can reveal complementary patterns and enable the use of powerful pre-trained large models, such as large vision models (LVMs), for long-term time series forecasting (LTSF). However, as we identified in this work, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) LVM-based forecaster poses an inductive bias towards "forecasting periods". To harness this bias, we propose DMMV, a novel decomposition-based multi-modal view framework that leverages trend-seasonal decomposition and a novel backcast-residual based adaptive decomposition to integrate MMVs for LTSF. Comparative evaluations against 14 SOTA models across diverse datasets show that DMMV outperforms single-view and existing multi-modal baselines, achieving the best mean squared error (MSE) on 6 out of 8 benchmark datasets. The code for this paper is available at: https://github.com/D2I-Group/dmmv.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust fuzzy clustering for high-dimensional multivariate time series with outlier detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26982v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fuzzy clustering provides a natural framework for modeling partial memberships, particularly important in multivariate time series (MTS) where state boundaries are often ambiguous. For example, in EEG monitoring of driver alertness, neural activity evolves along a continuum (from unconscious to fully alert, with many intermediate levels of drowsiness) so crisp labels are unrealistic and partial memberships are essential. However, most existing algorithms are developed for static, low-dimensional data and struggle with temporal dependence, unequal sequence lengths, high dimensionality, and contamination by noise or artifacts. To address these challenges, we introduce RFCPCA, a robust fuzzy subspace-clustering method explicitly tailored to MTS that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first of its kind to simultaneously: (i) learn membership-informed subspaces, (ii) accommodate unequal lengths and moderately high dimensions, (iii) achieve robustness through trimming, exponential reweighting, and a dedicated noise cluster, and (iv) automatically select all required hyperparameters. These components enable RFCPCA to capture latent temporal structure, provide calibrated membership uncertainty, and flag series-level outliers while remaining stable under contamination. On driver drowsiness EEG, RFCPCA improves clustering accuracy over related methods and yields a more reliable characterization of uncertainty and outlier structure in MTS.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we examine whether frozen pre-trained forecasting models can provide effective representations for classification. To this end, we compare different representation extraction strategies and introduce two model-agnostic embedding augmentations. Our experiments show that the best forecasting models achieve classification accuracy that matches or even surpasses that of state-of-the-art models pre-trained specifically for classification. Moreover, we observe a positive correlation between forecasting and classification performance. These findings challenge the assumption that task-specific pre-training is necessary, and suggest that learning to forecast may provide a powerful route toward constructing general-purpose time series foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Recent Advances in Time Series Foundation Models (BERT2S)</p></details> |

With sensors and devices capturing every operational detail, the volume of time-series data has become a critical challenge for storage and processing systems. Efficient data management is essential to ensure scalability, cost-effectiveness, and timely analytics. To minimize storage expenses and optimize performance, data compression algorithms are frequently utilized in data historians and acquisition systems. However, compression comes with trade-offs that may compromise the accuracy and reliability of engineering analytics that depend on this compressed data. Understanding these trade-offs is essential for developing data strategies that support both operational efficiency and accurate, reliable analytics. This paper assesses the relation of common compression mechanisms used in real-time and historical data systems and the accuracy of analytical solutions, including statistical analysis, anomaly detection, and machine learning models. Through theoretical analysis, simulated signal compression, and empirical assessment, we illustrate that excessive compression can lose critical patterns, skew statistical measures, and diminish predictive accuracy. The study suggests optimum methods and best practices for striking a compromise between analytical integrity and compression efficiency.</p></details> | 9 pages |

In this paper we formalize the ground for the MIMOSA (Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms) framework, a comprehensive methodology for generating predictive models that balance interpretability with performance while embedding key ethical properties. We formally define here the supervised learning setting across diverse decision-making tasks and data types, including tabular data, time series, images, text, transactions, and trajectories. We characterize three major families of interpretable models: feature importance, rule, and instance based models. For each family, we analyze their interpretability dimensions, reasoning mechanisms, and complexity. Beyond interpretability, we formalize three critical ethical properties, namely causality, fairness, and privacy, providing formal definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures for each. We then examine the inherent trade-offs between these properties and discuss how privacy requirements, fairness constraints, and causal reasoning can be embedded within interpretable pipelines. By evaluating ethical measures during model generation, this framework establishes the theoretical foundations for developing AI systems that are not only accurate and interpretable but also fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware, i.e., trustworthy.</p></details> |  |
| **[MSAD: A Deep Dive into Model Selection for Time series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26643v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is a fundamental task for time series analytics with important implications for the downstream performance of many applications. Despite increasing academic interest and the large number of methods proposed in the literature, recent benchmarks and evaluation studies demonstrated that no overall best anomaly detection methods exist when applied to very heterogeneous time series datasets. Therefore, the only scalable and viable solution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected from diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select, based on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to run. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to time series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based approaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper studies the performance of time series classification methods used as model selection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations derived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we propose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series classification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results demonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly detection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution time. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and represents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection step in general AutoML pipelines.

Recent quantum machine learning approaches, such as quantum kernel methods and variational quantum circuits, have shown promise in capturing complex data distributions for anomaly detection but remain constrained by limited qubit counts. We introduce in this work a novel Quantum Gated Recurrent Unit (QGRU)-based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) employing Successive Data Injection (SuDaI) and a multi-metric gating strategy for robust network anomaly detection. Our model uniquely utilizes a quantum-enhanced generator that outputs parameters (mean and log-variance) of a Gaussian distribution via reparameterization, combined with a Wasserstein critic to stabilize adversarial training. Anomalies are identified through a novel gating mechanism that initially flags potential anomalies based on Gaussian uncertainty estimates and subsequently verifies them using a composite of critic scores and reconstruction errors. Evaluated on benchmark datasets, our method achieves a high time-series aware F1 score (TaF1) of 89.43% demonstrating superior capability in detecting anomalies accurately and promptly as compared to existing classical and quantum models. Furthermore, the trained QGRU-WGAN was deployed on real IBM Quantum hardware, where it retained high anomaly detection performance, confirming its robustness and practical feasibility on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering Causal Relationships Between Time Series With Spatial Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26485v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery is the subfield of causal inference concerned with estimating the structure of cause-and-effect relationships in a system of interrelated variables, as opposed to quantifying the strength of causal effects. As interest in causal discovery builds in fields such as ecology, public health, and environmental sciences where data is regularly collected with spatial and temporal structures, approaches must evolve to manage autocorrelation and complex confounding. As it stands, the few proposed causal discovery algorithms for spatiotemporal data require summarizing across locations, ignore spatial autocorrelation, and/or scale poorly to high dimensions. Here, we introduce our developing framework that extends time-series causal discovery to systems with spatial structure, building upon work on causal discovery across contexts and methods for handling spatial confounding in causal effect estimation. We close by outlining remaining gaps in the literature and directions for future research.</p></details> | 14 pages, 1 figure |

In the classical univariate case, the latter is based on fitting an extreme-value distribution to the sample of (annual) block maxima. Mathematically, the target parameters of the extreme-value distribution also show up in limit results for other high order statistics, which suggests estimation based on blockwise large order statistics. It is shown that a naive approach based on maximizing an independence log-likelihood yields an estimator that is inconsistent in general. A consistent, bias-corrected estimator is proposed, and is analyzed theoretically and in finite-sample simulation studies. The new estimator is shown to be more efficient than traditional counterparts, for instance for estimating large return levels or return periods.</p></details> | 92 pages |

We present several approaches to explainable and reliable AI in finance. \emph{First}, we describe how Time-LLM, a time series foundation model, uses a prompt to avoid a wrong directional forecast. \emph{Second}, we show that combining foundation models for time series forecasting with a reliability estimator can filter our unreliable predictions. \emph{Third}, we argue for symbolic reasoning encoding domain rules for transparent justification. These approaches shift emphasize executing only forecasts that are both reliable and explainable.

By leveraging generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), it is possible to create artificial datasets that preserve the statistical properties of real financial records while mitigating privacy risks and regulatory constraints. Despite the rapid growth of this field, a comprehensive synthesis of the current research landscape has been lacking. This systematic review consolidates and analyses 72 studies published since 2018 that focus on synthetic financial data generation. We categorise the types of financial information synthesised, the generative methods employed, and the evaluation strategies used to assess data utility and privacy. The findings indicate that GAN-based approaches dominate the literature, particularly for generating time-series market data and tabular credit data.

| **[Time Weaver: A Conditional Time Series Generation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02682v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imagine generating a city's electricity demand pattern based on weather, the presence of an electric vehicle, and location, which could be used for capacity planning during a winter freeze. Such real-world time series are often enriched with paired heterogeneous contextual metadata (e.g., weather and location). Current approaches to time series generation often ignore this paired metadata. Additionally, the heterogeneity in metadata poses several practical challenges in adapting existing conditional generation approaches from the image, audio, and video domains to the time series domain. To address this gap, we introduce TIME WEAVER, a novel diffusion-based model that leverages the heterogeneous metadata in the form of categorical, continuous, and even time-variant variables to significantly improve time series generation. Additionally, we show that naive extensions of standard evaluation metrics from the image to the time series domain are insufficient. These metrics do not penalize conditional generation approaches for their poor specificity in reproducing the metadata-specific features in the generated time series. Thus, we innovate a novel evaluation metric that accurately captures the specificity of conditional generation and the realism of the generated time series. We show that TIME WEAVER outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by up to 30% in downstream classification tasks on real-world energy, medical, air quality, and traffic datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Posterior Sampling: Time Series Generation with Hard Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12652v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating realistic time series samples is crucial for stress-testing models and protecting user privacy by using synthetic data. In engineering and safety-critical applications, these samples must meet certain hard constraints that are domain-specific or naturally imposed by physics or nature. Consider, for example, generating electricity demand patterns with constraints on peak demand times. This can be used to stress-test the functioning of power grids during adverse weather conditions. Existing approaches for generating constrained time series are either not scalable or degrade sample quality. To address these challenges, we introduce Constrained Posterior Sampling (CPS), a diffusion-based sampling algorithm that aims to project the posterior mean estimate into the constraint set after each denoising update. Notably, CPS scales to a large number of constraints ($\sim100$) without requiring additional training. We provide theoretical justifications highlighting the impact of our projection step on sampling. Empirically, CPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in sample quality and similarity to real time series by around 70\% and 22\%, respectively, on real-world stocks, traffic, and air quality datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Infinite-dimensional Mahalanobis Distance with Applications to Kernelized Novelty Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11873v3)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Mahalanobis distance is a classical tool used to measure the covariance-adjusted distance between points in $\bbR^d$. In this work, we extend the concept of Mahalanobis distance to separable Banach spaces by reinterpreting it as a Cameron-Martin norm associated with a probability measure. This approach leads to a basis-free, data-driven notion of anomaly distance through the so-called variance norm, which can naturally be estimated using empirical measures of a sample. Our framework generalizes the classical $\bbR^d$, functional $(L^2[0,1])^d$, and kernelized settings; importantly, it incorporates non-injective covariance operators. We prove that the variance norm is invariant under invertible bounded linear transformations of the data, extending previous results which are limited to unitary operators. In the Hilbert space setting, we connect the variance norm to the RKHS of the covariance operator, and establish consistency and convergence results for estimation using empirical measures with Tikhonov regularization. Using the variance norm, we introduce the notion of a kernelized nearest-neighbour Mahalanobis distance, and study some of its finite-sample concentration properties. In an empirical study on 12 real-world data sets, we demonstrate that the kernelized nearest-neighbour Mahalanobis distance outperforms the traditional kernelized Mahalanobis distance for multivariate time series novelty detection, using state-of-the-art time series kernels such as the signature, global alignment, and Volterra reservoir kernels.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches require costly numerical solvers to sample between arbitrary time points. We introduce Neural Stochastic Flows (NSFs) and their latent variants, which directly learn (latent) SDE transition laws using conditional normalising flows with architectural constraints that preserve properties inherited from stochastic flows. This enables one-shot sampling between arbitrary states and yields up to two orders of magnitude speed-ups at large time gaps. Experiments on synthetic SDE simulations and on real-world tracking and video data show that NSFs maintain distributional accuracy comparable to numerical approaches while dramatically reducing computation for arbitrary time-point sampling.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (poster).

We present RailEstate, a novel web based system that integrates spatial analytics, natural language interfaces, and interactive forecasting to analyze how proximity to metro stations influences residential property prices in the Washington metropolitan area. Unlike static mapping tools or generic listing platforms, RailEstate combines 25 years of historical housing data with transit infrastructure to support low latency geospatial queries, time series visualizations, and predictive modeling. Users can interactively explore ZIP code level price patterns, investigate long term trends, and forecast future housing values around any metro station. A key innovation is our natural language chatbot, which translates plain-English questions e.g., What is the highest price in Falls Church in the year 2000? into executable SQL over a spatial database. This unified and interactive platform empowers urban planners, investors, and residents to derive actionable insights from metro linked housing data without requiring technical expertise.</p></details> |  |

To allay stress, expecting parents seek advice and share experiences in a variety of venues, from in-person birth education classes and parenting groups to virtual communities, for example, BabyCenter, a moderated online forum community with over 4 million members in the United States alone. In this study, we aim to understand how parents talk about pregnancy, birth, and parenting by analyzing 5.43M posts and comments from the April 2017--January 2024 cohort of 331,843 BabyCenter "birth club" users (that is, users who participate in due date forums or "birth clubs" based on their babies' due dates). Using BERTopic to locate breastfeeding threads and LDA to summarize themes, we compare documents in breastfeeding threads to all other birth-club content. Analyzing time series of word rank, we find that posts and comments containing anxiety-related terms increased steadily from April 2017 to January 2024. We used an ensemble of topic models to identify dominant breastfeeding topics within birth clubs, and then explored trends among all user content versus those who posted in threads related to breastfeeding topics. We conducted Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling to identify the most common topics in the full population, as well as within the subset breastfeeding population. We find that the topic of sleep dominates in content generated by the breastfeeding population, as well anxiety-related and work/daycare topics that are not predominant in the full BabyCenter birth club dataset.</p></details> |  |

Combining SNNs with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), a variant of recurrent neural networks, gives rise to a robust framework for sequential data processing; however, traditional RNNs often lose local details when handling long sequences. Previous approaches, such as SpikGRU, fail to capture fine-grained local dependencies in event-based spatio-temporal data. In this paper, we introduce the Convolutional Spiking GRU (CS-GRU) cell, which leverages convolutional operations to preserve local structure and dependencies while integrating the temporal precision of spiking neurons with the efficient gating mechanisms of GRUs. This versatile architecture excels on both temporal datasets (NTIDIGITS, SHD) and spatio-temporal benchmarks (MNIST, DVSGesture, CIFAR10DVS). Our experiments show that CS-GRU outperforms state-of-the-art GRU variants by an average of 4.35%, achieving over 90% accuracy on sequential tasks and up to 99.31% on MNIST. It is worth noting that our solution achieves 69% higher efficiency compared to SpikGRU.

Our approach explores deterministic and learned strategies for time series quantization and then leverages a masked correlation learning objective, aligning discrete image and time series tokens in a unified representation space. Instantiated in the Earth observation domain, the pretrained model generates consistent global temperature profiles from satellite imagery and is validated through counterfactual experiments. Across downstream tasks, our task-agnostic pretraining outperforms task-specific fusion by 6% in R^2 and 2% in RMSE on average, and exceeds baseline methods by 50% in R^2 and 12% in RMSE. Finally, we analyze gradient sensitivity across modalities, providing insights into model robustness. Code, data, and weights will be released under a permissive license.</p></details> |  |
| **[Group Interventions on Deep Networks for Causal Discovery in Subsystems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23906v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery uncovers complex relationships between variables, enhancing predictions, decision-making, and insights into real-world systems, especially in nonlinear multivariate time series. However, most existing methods primarily focus on pairwise cause-effect relationships, overlooking interactions among groups of variables, i.e., subsystems and their collective causal influence. In this study, we introduce gCDMI, a novel multi-group causal discovery method that leverages group-level interventions on trained deep neural networks and employs model invariance testing to infer causal relationships. Our approach involves three key steps. First, we use deep learning to jointly model the structural relationships among groups of all time series. Second, we apply group-wise interventions to the trained model. Finally, we conduct model invariance testing to determine the presence of causal links among variable groups. We evaluate our method on simulated datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in identifying group-level causal relationships compared to existing methods. Additionally, we validate our approach on real-world datasets, including brain networks and climate ecosystems. Our results highlight that applying group-level interventions to deep learning models, combined with invariance testing, can effectively reveal complex causal structures, offering valuable insights for domains such as neuroscience and climate science.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Access.

| **[The Urban Vision Hackathon Dataset and Models: Towards Image Annotations and Accurate Vision Models for Indian Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02563v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This report describes the UVH-26 dataset, the first public release by AIM@IISc of a large-scale dataset of annotated traffic-camera images from India. The dataset comprises 26,646 high-resolution (1080p) images sampled from 2800 Bengaluru's Safe-City CCTV cameras over a 4-week period, and subsequently annotated through a crowdsourced hackathon involving 565 college students from across India. In total, 1.8 million bounding boxes were labeled across 14 vehicle classes specific to India: Cycle, 2-Wheeler (Motorcycle), 3-Wheeler (Auto-rickshaw), LCV (Light Commercial Vehicles), Van, Tempo-traveller, Hatchback, Sedan, SUV, MUV, Mini-bus, Bus, Truck and Other. Of these, 283k-316k consensus ground truth bounding boxes and labels were derived for distinct objects in the 26k images using Majority Voting and STAPLE algorithms. Further, we train multiple contemporary detectors, including YOLO11-S/X, RT-DETR-S/X, and DAMO-YOLO-T/L using these datasets, and report accuracy based on mAP50, mAP75 and mAP50:95. Models trained on UVH-26 achieve 8.4-31.5% improvements in mAP50:95 over equivalent baseline models trained on COCO dataset, with RT-DETR-X showing the best performance at 0.67 (mAP50:95) as compared to 0.40 for COCO-trained weights for common classes (Car, Bus, and Truck). This demonstrates the benefits of domain-specific training data for Indian traffic scenarios. The release package provides the 26k images with consensus annotations based on Majority Voting (UVH-26-MV) and STAPLE (UVH-26-ST) and the 6 fine-tuned YOLO and DETR models on each of these datasets. By capturing the heterogeneity of Indian urban mobility directly from operational traffic-camera streams, UVH-26 addresses a critical gap in existing global benchmarks, and offers a foundation for advancing detection, classification, and deployment of intelligent transportation systems in emerging nations with complex traffic conditions.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents HybridST, a hybrid architecture that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), multi-head temporal Transformers, and supervised ensemble learning methods (XGBoost or Random Forest) to collectively capture spatial dependencies, long-range temporal patterns, and exogenous signals, including weather, calendar, or control states. We test our model on the METR-LA, PEMS-BAY, and Seattle Loop tree public benchmark datasets. These datasets include situations ranging from freeway sensor networks to vehicle-infrastructure cooperative perception. Experimental results show that HybridST consistently beats classical baselines (LSTM, GCN, DCRNN, PDFormer) on important metrics like MAE and RMSE, while still being very scalable and easy to understand. The proposed framework presents a promising avenue for real-time urban mobility planning, energy optimization, and congestion alleviation strategies, especially within the framework of smart cities and significant events such as the 2030 FIFA World Cup.</p></details> |  |

In this regard, we propose a Multi-view Feature Fusion (MuFF) method for network anomaly traffic detection. MuFF models the temporal and interactive relationships of packets in network traffic based on the temporal and interactive viewpoints respectively. It learns temporal and interactive features. These features are then fused from different perspectives for anomaly traffic detection. Extensive experiments on six real traffic datasets show that MuFF has excellent performance in network anomalous traffic detection, which makes up for the shortcomings of detection under a single perspective.</p></details> | <details><summary>in Ch...</summary><p>in Chinese language, Accepted by Journal of Command and Control. https://www.jc2.org.cn/CN/10.20278/j.jc2.2096-0204.2024.0196</p></details> |
| **[Adv-BMT: Bidirectional Motion Transformer for Safety-Critical Traffic Scenario Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09485v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scenario-based testing is essential for validating the performance of autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, such testing is limited by the scarcity of long-tailed, safety-critical scenarios in existing datasets collected in the real world. To tackle the data issue, we propose the Adv-BMT framework, which augments real-world scenarios with diverse and realistic adversarial traffic interactions. The core component of Adv-BMT is a bidirectional motion transformer (BMT) model to perform inverse traffic motion predictions, which takes agent information in the last time step of the scenario as input, and reconstructs the traffic in the inverse of chronological order until the initial time step. The Adv-BMT framework is a two-staged pipeline: it first conducts adversarial initializations and then inverse motion predictions. Different from previous work, we do not need any collision data for pretraining, and are able to generate realistic and diverse collision interactions. Our experimental results validate the quality of generated collision scenarios by Adv-BMT: training in our augmented dataset would reduce episode collision rates by 20%. Demo and code are available at: https://metadriverse.github.io/adv-bmt/.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Online Robust Tensor Recovery Approach for Streaming Traffic Data Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01267v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data quality is critical to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), as complete and accurate traffic data underpin reliable decision-making in traffic control and management. Recent advances in low-rank tensor recovery algorithms have shown strong potential in capturing the inherent structure of high-dimensional traffic data and restoring degraded observations. However, traditional batch-based methods demand substantial computational and storage resources, which limits their scalability in the face of continuously expanding traffic data volumes. Moreover, recent online tensor recovery methods often suffer from severe performance degradation in complex real-world scenarios due to their insufficient exploitation of the intrinsic structural properties of traffic data. To address these challenges, we reformulate the traffic data recovery problem within a streaming framework, and propose a novel online robust tensor recovery algorithm that simultaneously leverages both the global spatio-temporal correlations and local consistency of traffic data, achieving high recovery accuracy and significantly improved computational efficiency in large-scale scenarios. Our method is capable of simultaneously handling missing and anomalous values in traffic data, and demonstrates strong adaptability across diverse missing patterns. Experimental results on three real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high recovery accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency by up to three orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art batch-based methods. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed approach as a scalable and effective solution for traffic data quality enhancement in ITS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Traffic-Aware Grid Planning for Dynamic Wireless Electric Vehicle Charging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00941v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic Wireless Electric Vehicle Charging (DWC) on electrified roadways is an emerging technology that can significantly reduce battery sizes, eliminate charging downtime, and alleviate range anxiety, specially for long-haul transportation and fleet operations of electric vehicles (EVs). However, these systems introduce new challenges for power system planning due to their short-duration and high-power demands which can strain the grid if not properly managed. As the energy demands from DWC depend on vehicle speed, density, dwell time in charging zones, and load profiles along road segments, there is a need for integrated planning of such systems, jointly considering both traffic behavior and EV energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a traffic-aware grid planning framework for DWC. We leverage a macroscopic Cell Transmission Model of traffic flow to estimate real-time, spatiotemporal EV charging demand from DWC corridors. The demand model is then integrated into an AC Optimal Power Flow based formulation to optimally size a microgrid that supports DWC under varying traffic conditions while minimizing the cost of operation. Our framework explicitly models how spatiotemporal traffic patterns affect the utilization of grid resources to obtain system designs that achieve lower costs and are easier to operationalize as compared to planning models that rely on worst-case traffic data. We demonstrate the framework on data from a 14-mile segment of the I-210W highway in California, USA, evaluating multiple traffic scenarios like free-flow, severe congestion, accidents of varying severity, and natural disasters like forest fires. Our results demonstrate that traffic-aware grid planning significantly reduces infrastructure costs as compared to worst-scenario based modeling, while ensuring reliability of service in terms of meeting charging demands under diverse traffic conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-agent Reinforcement Learning Model for Regional Adaptive Traffic Signal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00551v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several studies have employed reinforcement learning (RL) to address the challenges of regional adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) and achieved promising results. In this field, existing research predominantly adopts multi-agent frameworks. However, the adoption of multi-agent frameworks presents challenges for scalability. Instead, the Traffic signal control (TSC) problem necessitates a single-agent framework. TSC inherently relies on centralized management by a single control center, which can monitor traffic conditions across all roads in the study area and coordinate the control of all intersections. This work proposes a single-agent RL-based regional ATSC model compatible with probe vehicle technology. Key components of the RL design include state, action, and reward function definitions. To facilitate learning and manage congestion, both state and reward functions are defined based on queue length, with action designed to regulate queue dynamics. The queue length definition used in this study differs slightly from conventional definitions but is closely correlated with congestion states. More importantly, it allows for reliable estimation using link travel time data from probe vehicles. With probe vehicle data already covering most urban roads, this feature enhances the proposed method's potential for widespread deployment. The method was comprehensively evaluated using the SUMO simulation platform. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively mitigates large-scale regional congestion levels via coordinated multi-intersection control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Single-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Regional Traffic Signal Control Under Demand Fluctuations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00549v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic congestion, primarily driven by intersection queuing, significantly impacts urban living standards, safety, environmental quality, and economic efficiency. While Traffic Signal Control (TSC) systems hold potential for congestion mitigation, traditional optimization models often fail to capture real-world traffic complexity and dynamics. This study introduces a novel single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework for regional adaptive TSC, circumventing the coordination complexities inherent in multi-agent systems through a centralized decision-making paradigm. The model employs an adjacency matrix to unify the encoding of road network topology, real-time queue states derived from probe vehicle data, and current signal timing parameters. Leveraging the efficient learning capabilities of the DreamerV3 world model, the agent learns control policies where actions sequentially select intersections and adjust their signal phase splits to regulate traffic inflow/outflow, analogous to a feedback control system. Reward design prioritizes queue dissipation, directly linking congestion metrics (queue length) to control actions. Simulation experiments conducted in SUMO demonstrate the model's effectiveness: under inference scenarios with multi-level (10%, 20%, 30%) Origin-Destination (OD) demand fluctuations, the framework exhibits robust anti-fluctuation capability and significantly reduces queue lengths. This work establishes a new paradigm for intelligent traffic control compatible with probe vehicle technology. Future research will focus on enhancing practical applicability by incorporating stochastic OD demand fluctuations during training and exploring regional optimization mechanisms for contingency events.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimization of continuous-flow over traffic networks with fundamental diagram constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00500v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimal transport (OT) theory provides a principled framework for modeling mass movement in applications such as mobility, logistics, and economics. Classical formulations, however, generally ignore capacity limits that are intrinsic in applications, in particular in traffic flow problems. We address this limitation by incorporating fundamental diagrams into a dynamic continuous-flow OT model on graphs, thereby including empirical relations between local density and maximal flux. We adopt an Eulerian kinetic action on graphs that preserves displacement interpolation in direct analogy with the continuous theory. Momentum lives on edges and density on nodes, mirroring road-network semantics in which segments carry speed and intersections store mass. The resulting fundamental-diagram-constrained OT problem preserves mass conservation and admits a convex variational discretization, yielding optimal congestion-aware traffic flow over road networks. We establish the existence and uniqueness of the optimal flow with sources and sinks, and develop an efficient convex optimization method. Numerical studies begin with a single-lane line network and scale to a city-level road network.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Information-Theoretic Greedy Layer-wise Training for Traffic Sign Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27651v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained with a global cross-entropy loss in a supervised end-to-end manner: neurons need to store their outgoing weights; training alternates between a forward pass (computation) and a top-down backward pass (learning) which is biologically implausible. Alternatively, greedy layer-wise training eliminates the need for cross-entropy loss and backpropagation. By avoiding the computation of intermediate gradients and the storage of intermediate outputs, it reduces memory usage and helps mitigate issues such as vanishing or exploding gradients. However, most existing layer-wise training approaches have been evaluated only on relatively small datasets with simple deep architectures. In this paper, we first systematically analyze the training dynamics of popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) through an information-theoretic lens. Our findings reveal that networks converge layer-by-layer from bottom to top and that the flow of information adheres to a Markov information bottleneck principle. Building on these observations, we propose a novel layer-wise training approach based on the recently developed deterministic information bottleneck (DIB) and the matrix-based R\'enyi's $\alpha$-order entropy functional. Specifically, each layer is trained jointly with an auxiliary classifier that connects directly to the output layer, enabling the learning of minimal sufficient task-relevant representations. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our training procedure on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using modern deep CNNs and further demonstrate its applicability to a practical task involving traffic sign recognition. Our approach not only outperforms existing layer-wise training baselines but also achieves performance comparable to SGD.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Dual Large Language Models Architecture with Herald Guided Prompts for Parallel Fine Grained Traffic Signal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00136v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging large language models (LLMs) in traffic signal control (TSC) improves optimization efficiency and interpretability compared to traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods. However, existing LLM-based approaches are limited by fixed time signal durations and are prone to hallucination errors, while RL methods lack robustness in signal timing decisions and suffer from poor generalization. To address these challenges, this paper proposes HeraldLight, a dual LLMs architecture enhanced by Herald guided prompts. The Herald Module extracts contextual information and forecasts queue lengths for each traffic phase based on real-time conditions. The first LLM, LLM-Agent, uses these forecasts to make fine grained traffic signal control, while the second LLM, LLM-Critic, refines LLM-Agent's outputs, correcting errors and hallucinations. These refined outputs are used for score-based fine-tuning to improve accuracy and robustness. Simulation experiments using CityFlow on real world datasets covering 224 intersections in Jinan (12), Hangzhou (16), and New York (196) demonstrate that HeraldLight outperforms state of the art baselines, achieving a 20.03% reduction in average travel time across all scenarios and a 10.74% reduction in average queue length on the Jinan and Hangzhou scenarios.

Traditional batch learning models face challenges such as high maintenance and poor adaptability to rapid anomaly changes, known as concept drift. In contrast, streaming learning integrates online and incremental learning, enabling seamless updates and concept drift detection to improve robustness. This study investigates anomaly detection in streaming IoT traffic as binary classification, comparing batch and streaming learning approaches while assessing the limitations of current IoT traffic datasets. We simulated heterogeneous network data streams by carefully mixing existing datasets and streaming the samples one by one. Our results highlight the failure of batch models to handle concept drift, but also reveal persisting limitations of current datasets to expose model limitations due to low traffic heterogeneity. We also investigated the competitiveness of tree-based ML algorithms, well-known in batch anomaly detection, and compared it to non-tree-based ones, confirming the advantages of the former. Adaptive Random Forest achieved F1-score of 0.990 $\pm$ 0.006 at one-third the computational cost of its batch counterpart. Hoeffding Adaptive Tree reached F1-score of 0.910 $\pm$ 0.007, reducing computational cost by four times, making it a viable choice for online applications despite a slight trade-off in stability.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Traditional accident prediction models treat road segments independently, failing to capture complex spatial relationships and temporal dependencies in urban transportation networks. This study develops MDAS-GNN, a Multi-Dimensional Attention-based Spatial-diffusion Graph Neural Network integrating three core risk dimensions: traffic safety, infrastructure, and environmental risk. The framework employs feature-specific spatial diffusion mechanisms and multi-head temporal attention to capture dependencies across different time horizons. Evaluated on UK Department for Transport accident data across Central London, South Manchester, and SE Birmingham, MDASGNN achieves superior performance compared to established baseline methods. The model maintains consistently low prediction errors across short, medium, and long-term periods, with particular strength in long-term forecasting. Ablation studies confirm that integrated multi-dimensional features outperform singlefeature approaches, reducing prediction errors by up to 40%. This framework provides civil engineers and urban planners with advanced predictive capabilities for transportation infrastructure design, enabling data-driven decisions for road network optimization, infrastructure resource improvements, and strategic safety interventions in urban development projects.</p></details> |  |

However, existing MLLMs in this domain primarily focus on coarse-grained image-level or video-level comprehension and often struggle to handle fine-grained visual details or localized scene components, limiting their applicability in complex accident scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose SafePLUG, a novel framework that empowers MLLMs with both Pixel-Level Understanding and temporal Grounding for comprehensive traffic accident analysis. SafePLUG supports both arbitrary-shaped visual prompts for region-aware question answering and pixel-level segmentation based on language instructions, while also enabling the recognition of temporally anchored events in traffic accident scenarios. To advance the development of MLLMs for traffic accident understanding, we curate a new dataset containing multimodal question-answer pairs centered on diverse accident scenarios, with detailed pixel-level annotations and temporal event boundaries. Experimental results show that SafePLUG achieves strong performance on multiple tasks, including region-based question answering, pixel-level segmentation, temporal event localization, and accident event understanding. These capabilities lay a foundation for fine-grained understanding of complex traffic scenes, with the potential to improve driving safety and enhance situational awareness in smart transportation systems. The code, dataset, and model checkpoints will be made publicly available at: https://zihaosheng.github.io/SafePLUG</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code, dataset, and model checkpoints will be made publicly available at: https://zihaosheng.github.io/SafePLUG</p></details> |
| **[A Cloud-Based Spatio-Temporal GNN-Transformer Hybrid Model for Traffic Flow Forecasting with External Feature Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27039v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate traffic flow forecasting is essential for the development of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), supporting tasks such as traffic signal optimization, congestion management, and route planning. Traditional models often fail to effectively capture complex spatial-temporal dependencies in large-scale road networks, especially under the influence of external factors such as weather, holidays, and traffic accidents. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a cloud-based hybrid model that integrates Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNN) with a Transformer architecture for traffic flow prediction. The model leverages the strengths of GNNs in modeling spatial correlations across road networks and the Transformers' ability to capture long-term temporal dependencies. External contextual features are incorporated via feature fusion to enhance predictive accuracy. The proposed model is deployed on a cloud computing platform to achieve scalability and real-time adaptability. Experimental evaluation of the dataset shows that our model outperforms baseline methods (LSTM, TCN, GCN, pure Transformer) with an RMSE of only 17.92 and a MAE of only 10.53. These findings suggest that the hybrid GNN-Transformer approach provides an effective and scalable solution for cloud-based ITS applications, offering methodological advancements for traffic flow forecasting and practical implications for congestion mitigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval Augmented Generation-Enhanced Distributed LLM Agents for Generalizable Traffic Signal Control with Emergency Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26242v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3 adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17 to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[DARTS: A Drone-Based AI-Powered Real-Time Traffic Incident Detection System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26004v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid and reliable incident detection is critical for reducing crash-related fatalities, injuries, and congestion. However, conventional methods, such as closed-circuit television, dashcam footage, and sensor-based detection, separate detection from verification, suffer from limited flexibility, and require dense infrastructure or high penetration rates, restricting adaptability and scalability to shifting incident hotspots. To overcome these challenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic incident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial perspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better low-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep learning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident detection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected dataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity assessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a web-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS detected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local transportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion propagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and enable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk. Crucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on frequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and cost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings. This study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated real-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for the operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation management.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version.

| **[VISAT: Benchmarking Adversarial and Distribution Shift Robustness in Traffic Sign Recognition with Visual Attributes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26833v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present VISAT, a novel open dataset and benchmarking suite for evaluating model robustness in the task of traffic sign recognition with the presence of visual attributes. Built upon the Mapillary Traffic Sign Dataset (MTSD), our dataset introduces two benchmarks that respectively emphasize robustness against adversarial attacks and distribution shifts. For our adversarial attack benchmark, we employ the state-of-the-art Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) method to generate adversarial inputs and evaluate their impact on popular models. Additionally, we investigate the effect of adversarial attacks on attribute-specific multi-task learning (MTL) networks, revealing spurious correlations among MTL tasks. The MTL networks leverage visual attributes (color, shape, symbol, and text) that we have created for each traffic sign in our dataset. For our distribution shift benchmark, we utilize ImageNet-C's realistic data corruption and natural variation techniques to perform evaluations on the robustness of both base and MTL models. Moreover, we further explore spurious correlations among MTL tasks through synthetic alterations of traffic sign colors using color quantization techniques. Our experiments focus on two major backbones, ResNet-152 and ViT-B/32, and compare the performance between base and MTL models. The VISAT dataset and benchmarking framework contribute to the understanding of model robustness for traffic sign recognition, shedding light on the challenges posed by adversarial attacks and distribution shifts. We believe this work will facilitate advancements in developing more robust models for real-world applications in autonomous driving and cyber-physical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Pre-Padding: Generating Evasive Network Traffic Against Transformer-Based Classifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25810v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To date, traffic obfuscation techniques have been widely adopted to protect network data privacy and security by obscuring the true patterns of traffic. Nevertheless, as the pre-trained models emerge, especially transformer-based classifiers, existing traffic obfuscation methods become increasingly vulnerable, as witnessed by current studies reporting the traffic classification accuracy up to 99\% or higher. To counter such high-performance transformer-based classification models, we in this paper propose a novel and effective \underline{adv}ersarial \underline{traffic}-generating approach (AdvTraffic\footnote{The code and data are available at: http://xxx}). Our approach has two key innovations: (i) a pre-padding strategy is proposed to modify packets, which effectively overcomes the limitations of existing research against transformer-based models for network traffic classification; and (ii) a reinforcement learning model is employed to optimize network traffic perturbations, aiming to maximize adversarial effectiveness against transformer-based classification models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply adversarial perturbation techniques to defend against transformer-based traffic classifiers. Furthermore, our method can be easily deployed into practical network environments. Finally, multi-faceted experiments are conducted across several real-world datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively undermine transformer-based classifiers, significantly reducing classification accuracy from 99\% to as low as 25.68\%.</p></details> |  |

Traffic was captured using Wireshark, and key metrics (including delay, jitter, bandwidth, and packet loss) were analyzed. Google Drive maintained the most consistent performance across both types of networks, showing low latency and reduced jitter. Dropbox showed efficient bandwidth utilization, but experienced a longer delay over LTE, attributed to a greater number of intermediate hops. OneDrive presented variable behavior, with elevated packet rates and increased sensitivity to fluctuations in the mobile network. A bimodal distribution of packet sizes was observed and modeled using a dual Poisson function. In general, Wi-Fi connections provided greater stability for multimedia transfers, while LTE performance varied depending on platform-specific implementations. The results contribute to a better understanding of traffic behavior in cloud-based storage applications and suggest further analysis with larger datasets and heterogeneous access networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 20th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies (CISTI), Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems</p></details> |

The dataset provides a unique view into global threat activity as observed through scanning and backscatter traffic, key indicators of large-scale probing behavior, data outages, and ongoing denial-of-service (DoS) campaigns. To process this extensive archive, coarse-to-fine methodology is adopted in which general insights are first extracted through a resource-efficient metadata sub-pipeline, followed by a more detailed packet header sub-pipeline for finer-grained analysis. The methodology establishes two sub-pipelines to enable scalable processing of nearly two decades of telescope data and supports multi-level exploration of traffic dynamics. Initial insights highlight long-term trends and recurring traffic spikes, some attributable to Internet-wide scanning events and others likely linked to DoS activities.We present general observations spanning 2006-2024, with a focused analysis of traffic characteristics during 2024.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pixels to Signals: A Real-Time Framework for Traffic Demand Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24902v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic congestion is becoming a challenge in the rapidly growing urban cities, resulting in increasing delays and inefficiencies within urban transportation systems. To address this issue a comprehensive methodology is designed to optimize traffic flow and minimize delays. The framework is structured with three primary components: (a) vehicle detection, (b) traffic prediction, and (c) traffic signal optimization. This paper presents the first component, vehicle detection. The methodology involves analyzing multiple sequential frames from a camera feed to compute the background, i.e. the underlying roadway, by averaging pixel values over time. The computed background is then utilized to extract the foreground, where the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is applied to detect vehicles. With its computational efficiency and minimal infrastructure modification requirements, the proposed methodology offers a practical and scalable solution for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing the Completeness of Traffic Scenario Categories for Automated Highway Driving Functions via Cluster-based Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02599v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to operate safely in increasingly complex traffic scenarios is a fundamental requirement for Automated Driving Systems (ADS). Ensuring the safe release of ADS functions necessitates a precise understanding of the occurring traffic scenarios. To support this objective, this work introduces a pipeline for traffic scenario clustering and the analysis of scenario category completeness. The Clustering Vector Quantized - Variational Autoencoder (CVQ-VAE) is employed for the clustering of highway traffic scenarios and utilized to create various catalogs with differing numbers of traffic scenario categories. Subsequently, the impact of the number of categories on the completeness considerations of the traffic scenario categories is analyzed. The results show an outperforming clustering performance compared to previous work. The trade-off between cluster quality and the amount of required data to maintain completeness is discussed based on the publicly available highD dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[DQ3D: Depth-guided Query for Transformer-Based 3D Object Detection in Traffic Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23144v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D object detection from multi-view images in traffic scenarios has garnered significant attention in recent years. Many existing approaches rely on object queries that are generated from 3D reference points to localize objects. However, a limitation of these methods is that some reference points are often far from the target object, which can lead to false positive detections. In this paper, we propose a depth-guided query generator for 3D object detection (DQ3D) that leverages depth information and 2D detections to ensure that reference points are sampled from the surface or interior of the object. Furthermore, to address partially occluded objects in current frame, we introduce a hybrid attention mechanism that fuses historical detection results with depth-guided queries, thereby forming hybrid queries. Evaluation on the nuScenes dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms the baseline by 6.3\% in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) and 4.3\% in the NuScenes Detection Score (NDS).</p></details> |  |
| **[Traffic flow forecasting, STL decomposition, Hybrid model, LSTM, ARIMA, XGBoost, Intelligent transportation systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23668v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate traffic flow forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation systems and urban traffic management. However, single model approaches often fail to capture the complex, nonlinear, and multi scale temporal patterns in traffic flow data. This study proposes a decomposition driven hybrid framework that integrates Seasonal Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) with three complementary predictive models. STL first decomposes the original time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components. Then, a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network models long term trends, an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model captures seasonal periodicity, and an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm predicts nonlinear residual fluctuations. The final forecast is obtained through multiplicative integration of the sub model predictions. Using 998 traffic flow records from a New York City intersection between November and December 2015, results show that the LSTM ARIMA XGBoost hybrid model significantly outperforms standalone models including LSTM, ARIMA, and XGBoost across MAE, RMSE, and R squared metrics. The decomposition strategy effectively isolates temporal characteristics, allowing each model to specialize, thereby improving prediction accuracy, interpretability, and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Error Adjustment Based on Spatiotemporal Correlation Fusion for Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23656v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) play a significant role in an increasing body of research on traffic forecasting due to their effectively capturing spatiotemporal patterns embedded in traffic data. A general assumption of training the said forecasting models via mean squared error estimation is that the errors across time steps and spatial positions are uncorrelated. However, this assumption does not really hold because of the autocorrelation caused by both the temporality and spatiality of traffic data. This gap limits the performance of DNN-based forecasting models and is overlooked by current studies. To fill up this gap, this paper proposes Spatiotemporally Autocorrelated Error Adjustment (SAEA), a novel and general framework designed to systematically adjust autocorrelated prediction errors in traffic forecasting. Unlike existing approaches that assume prediction errors follow a random Gaussian noise distribution, SAEA models these errors as a spatiotemporal vector autoregressive (VAR) process to capture their intrinsic dependencies. First, it explicitly captures both spatial and temporal error correlations by a coefficient matrix, which is then embedded into a newly formulated cost function. Second, a structurally sparse regularization is introduced to incorporate prior spatial information, ensuring that the learned coefficient matrix aligns with the inherent road network structure. Finally, an inference process with test-time error adjustment is designed to dynamically refine predictions, mitigating the impact of autocorrelated errors in real-time forecasting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified on different traffic datasets. Results across a wide range of traffic forecasting models show that our method enhances performance in almost all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

With the aim of overcoming such limitations, network operators are foreseeing Digital Twins (DTs) as key enablers, which are designed as dynamic and virtual replicas of network infrastructure, allowing operators to model, analyze, and optimize various operations without any risk of affecting the live network. However, for Digital Twin Networks (DTNs) to meet the challenges faced by operators especially in line with resource management, a driving engine is needed. In this paper, an AI (Artificial Intelligence)-driven approach is presented by integrating a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network into the DT framework, aimed at forecasting network traffic patterns and proactively managing resource allocation. Through analytical experiments, the AI-Enabled DT framework demonstrates superior performance benchmarked against baseline methods. Our study concludes that embedding AI capabilities within DTs paves the way for fully autonomous, adaptive, and high-performance network management in future mobile networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 fig...</summary><p>6 figures, 2 Tables, Accepted at IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM) 2025</p></details> |
| **[TraDE: Network and Traffic-aware Adaptive Scheduling for Microservices Under Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05323v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The transition from monolithic architecture to microservices has enhanced flexibility in application design and its scalable execution. This approach typically uses a computing cluster managed by a container orchestration platform to deploy microservices. However, this shift introduces significant challenges, particularly in the efficient scheduling of containerized services. These challenges are compounded by unpredictable scenarios such as dynamic incoming workloads with various execution traffic and variable communication delays among cluster nodes. Existing works often overlook the real-time traffic impacts of dynamic requests on running microservices, as well as the varied communication delays across cluster nodes. Consequently, even optimally deployed microservices could suffer from significant performance degradation over time. To address these issues, we propose a network and traffic-aware adaptive scheduling framework, TraDE, which can adaptively redeploy microservice instances to maintain desired performance amid changing traffic and network conditions within the hosting cluster. We have implemented TraDE as an extension to the Kubernetes platform. Additionally, we deployed realistic microservice applications in a real compute cluster and conducted extensive experiments to assess our framework's performance in various scenarios. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of TraDE in rescheduling running microservices to enhance end-to-end performance while maintaining a high goodput ratio. Compared with the existing method NetMARKS, TraDE outperforms it by reducing the average response time of the application by up to 48.3%, and improving the throughput by up to 1.2-1.5x across workloads while maintaining a goodput ratio of 95.36%, and showing robust adaptive capability to meet QoS targets under sustained workloads and dynamic networking conditions.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[A Traffic Prediction-Based Individualized Driver Warning System to Reduce Red Light Violations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03271v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Red light violation is a major cause of traffic collisions and resulting injuries and fatalities. Despite extensive prior work to reduce red light violations, they continue to be a major problem in practice, partly because existing systems suffer from the flaw of providing the same guidance to all drivers. As a result, some violations are avoided, but other drivers ignore or respond inappropriately to red light running systems, resulting in safety issues overall. We show a method of providing accurate warnings to individual drivers to avoid the broad guidance approach of most existing systems. Recognizing if a driver will run red lights is highly dependent on signal phase and timing, traffic conditions along the road, and individual driver behaviour, the proposed warning system contains three parts: a traffic prediction algorithm, an individual warning signal optimizer, and a driver warning display. The traffic prediction algorithm predicts future traffic states along the road towards the signalized intersections using the latest traffic conditions obtained through vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. Then, an optimization problem is formulated to compute the optimal warning signal based on predicted traffic states and driver reaction model. Finally, the optimal warning signal is shown on the display screen to advise driver on how much braking is needed to avoid running the red light. The system continuously updates the latest warning signal as the vehicle is approaching the intersection. Both numerical simulated driving scenarios and real-world road tests are used to demonstrate the proposed algorithm's performance under different conditions by comparing with previous work on red light running warning system. The results show that the system provides more effective and accurate warning signals to drivers, helping them avoid running red lights.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ASCE's Journal of Transportation Engineering, Part A: Systems</p></details> |

These methods become computationally prohibitive for large-scale networks due to non-linear growth in complexity with the number of OD pairs. This study introduces a novel data-driven approach using deep neural networks, specifically leveraging the Transformer architecture, to predict equilibrium path flows directly. By focusing on path-level traffic distribution, the proposed model captures intricate correlations between OD pairs, offering a more detailed and flexible analysis compared to traditional link-level approaches. The Transformer-based model drastically reduces computation time, while adapting to changes in demand and network structure without the need for recalculation. Numerical experiments are conducted on the Manhattan-like synthetic network, the Sioux Falls network, and the Eastern-Massachusetts network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is orders of magnitude faster than conventional optimization. It efficiently estimates path-level traffic flows in multi-class networks, reducing computational costs and improving prediction accuracy by capturing detailed trip and flow information. The model also adapts flexibly to varying demand and network conditions, supporting traffic management and enabling rapid `what-if' analyses for enhanced transportation planning and policy-making.</p></details> |  |

Compared with traditional reinforcement learning and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers three main advantages: zero-shot generalization, transferring unchanged to new road networks and out-of-distribution incidents by leveraging internal traffic-control policies and reasoning; a compact 3B-parameter design that supports real-time inference on mobile-class chips for edge deployment; and an explainable TSC process that enables multi-intersection coordination through communication and an asynchronous communication network. Extensive benchmarks show Traffic-R1 outperforms strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In production, the model now manages signals affecting over 55,000 drivers daily, reduces average queue lengths by more than 5%, and halves operator workload.

However, IoT networks remain vulnerable to security threats such as denial of service (DoS) attacks, anomalous traffic, and data manipulation due to decentralized architectures and limited resources. To address these issues, this paper proposes an advanced anomaly detection framework with three main phases. First, data preprocessing is performed using the Median KS Test to remove noise, handle missing values, and balance datasets for cleaner input. Second, a feature selection phase employs a Genetic Algorithm combined with eagle inspired search strategies to identify the most relevant features, reduce dimensionality, and improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, an ensemble classifier integrates Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms to achieve accurate and reliable anomaly detection. The proposed model demonstrates high adaptability and scalability across diverse IoT environments. Experimental results show that it outperforms existing methods by achieving 98 percent accuracy, 95 percent detection rate, and reductions in false positive (10 percent) and false negative (5 percent) rates. These results confirm the framework effectiveness and robustness in improving IoT network security against evolving cyber threats.</p></details> | 24 pages |

However, automatic traffic detectors across national road networks often provide incomplete coverage, leading to underrepresentation of minor roads. While recent machine learning advances have improved AADT estimation at unmeasured locations, most models produce only point predictions and overlook estimation uncertainty. This study addresses that gap by introducing an interval prediction approach that explicitly quantifies predictive uncertainty. We integrate a Quantile Random Forest model with Principal Component Analysis to generate AADT prediction intervals, providing plausible traffic ranges bounded by estimated minima and maxima. Using data from over 2,000 minor roads in England and Wales, and evaluated with specialized interval metrics, the proposed method achieves an interval coverage probability of 88.22%, a normalized average width of 0.23, and a Winkler Score of 7,468.47. By combining machine learning with spatial and high-dimensional analysis, this framework enhances both the accuracy and interpretability of AADT estimation, supporting more robust and informed transport planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing 5G V2X Mode 2 for Sporadic Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17395v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emerging road safety and autonomous vehicle applications require timely and reliable data delivery between vehicles and between vehicles and infrastructure. To satisfy this demand, 3GPP develops a 5G Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology. Depending on the served traffic type, 5G V2X specifications propose two channel access methods: (i) Mode 1, according to which a base station allocates resources to users, and (ii) Mode 2, according to which users autonomously select resources for their transmissions. In the paper, we consider a scenario with sporadic traffic, e.g., a vehicle generates a packet at a random time moment when it detects a dangerous situation, which imposes strict requirements on delay and reliability. To satisfy strict delay requirements, vehicles use Mode 2. We analyze the performance of Mode 2 for sporadic traffic and propose several approaches to improve it. Simulation results show that the proposed approaches can increase the system capacity by up to 40% with a low impact on complexity.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose FlowDet, a high-speed detector featuring a decoupled encoder optimization strategy applied to the DETR architecture. Specifically, FlowDet employs a novel Geometric Deformable Unit (GDU) for traffic-aware geometric modeling and a Scale-Aware Attention (SAA) module to maintain high representational power across extreme scale variations. To rigorously evaluate the model's performance in environments with severe occlusion and high object density, we collected the Intersection-Flow-5k dataset, a new challenging scene for this task. Evaluated on Intersection-Flow-5k, FlowDet establishes a new state-of-the-art. Compared to the strong RT-DETR baseline, it improves AP(test) by 1.5% and AP50(test) by 1.6%, while simultaneously reducing GFLOPs by 63.2% and increasing inference speed by 16.2%. Our work demonstrates a new path towards building highly efficient and accurate detectors for demanding, real-world perception systems. The Intersection-Flow-5k dataset is available at https://github.com/AstronZh/Intersection-Flow-5K.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by PRCV 2025.

Since each node in such environments generates various types of data with diverse service requirements, MAC protocol holds crucial importance to ensure efficient delivery. In this context, simple to complex MAC schemes are found in literature. This paper focuses on evaluating the performance of two major techniques "slot stealing" and "packet fragmentation" for the IIoT; representative protocols SS-MAC and FROG-MAC have been chosen from each category respectively. We conducted realistic simulations for the two protocols using Contiki. Delay and packet loss comparison for SS-MAC and FROG-MAC indicates the superiority of FROG-MAC due to reduction in the waiting time for urgent traffic. Thus, a simple fragmentation scheme could be deployed for efficient scheduling of heterogenous traffic in the industrial environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smart Traffic Signals: Comparing MARL and Fixed-Time Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14544v3)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban traffic congestion, particularly at intersections, significantly impacts travel time, fuel consumption, and emissions. Traditional fixed-time signal control systems often lack the adaptability to manage dynamic traffic patterns effectively. This study explores the application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to optimize traffic signal coordination across multiple intersections within a simulated environment. Utilizing Pygame, a simulation was developed to model a network of interconnected intersections with randomly generated vehicle flows to reflect realistic traffic variability. A decentralized MARL controller was implemented, in which each traffic signal operates as an autonomous agent, making decisions based on local observations and information from neighboring agents. Performance was evaluated against a baseline fixed-time controller using metrics such as average vehicle wait time and overall throughput. The MARL approach demonstrated statistically significant improvements, including reduced average waiting times and improved throughput. These findings suggest that MARL-based dynamic control strategies hold substantial promise for improving urban traffic management efficiency. More research is recommended to address scalability and real-world implementation challenges.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose four numerical methods for the approximation of three different generalized Wasserstein distances introduced in the last years, giving some insights about their physical meaning. After that, we explore their usage in the context of the sensitivity analysis of differential models for traffic flow. The quantification of models sensitivity is obtained by computing the generalized Wasserstein distances between two (numerical) solutions corresponding to different inputs, including different boundary conditions.</p></details> |  |

Traffic signaling is a key component in effective traffic management for such situations, but the advancements in intelligent traffic signaling have been exclusive to developed countries with structured traffic. The non-lane-based, heterogeneous traffic of Dhaka City requires a contextual approach. This study focuses on the development of an intelligent traffic signaling system feasible in the context of developing countries such as Bangladesh. We propose a pipeline leveraging Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) feeds, a low resources system Raspberry Pi 4B processing, and a state of the art YOLO-based object detection model trained on the Non-lane-based and Heterogeneous Traffic (NHT-1071) dataset to detect and classify heterogeneous traffic. A multi-objective optimization algorithm, NSGA-II, then generates optimized signal timings, minimizing waiting time while maximizing vehicle throughput. We test our implementation in a five-road intersection at Palashi, Dhaka, demonstrating the potential to significantly improve traffic management in similar situations. The developed testbed paves the way for more contextual and effective Intelligent Traffic Signaling (ITS) solutions for developing areas with complicated traffic dynamics such as Dhaka City.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS)</p></details> |
| **[Heimdallr: Fingerprinting SD-WAN Control-Plane Architecture via Encrypted Control Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16461v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) has emerged as a new paradigm for steering a large-scale network flexibly by adopting distributed software-defined network (SDN) controllers. The key to building a logically centralized but physically distributed control-plane is running diverse cluster management protocols to achieve consistency through an exchange of control traffic. Meanwhile, we observe that the control traffic exposes unique time-series patterns and directional relationships due to the operational structure even though the traffic is encrypted, and this pattern can disclose confidential information such as control-plane topology and protocol dependencies, which can be exploited for severe attacks. With this insight, we propose a new SD-WAN fingerprinting system, called Heimdallr. It analyzes periodical and operational patterns of SD-WAN cluster management protocols and the context of flow directions from the collected control traffic utilizing a deep learning-based approach, so that it can classify the cluster management protocols automatically from miscellaneous control traffic datasets. Our evaluation, which is performed in a realistic SD-WAN environment consisting of geographically distant three campus networks and one enterprise network shows that Heimdallr can classify SD-WAN control traffic with $\geq$ 93%, identify individual protocols with $\geq$ 80% macro F-1 scores, and finally can infer control-plane topology with $\geq$ 70% similarity.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Hypergame-based Cognition Modeling and Intention Interpretation for Human-Driven Vehicles in Connected Mixed Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15573v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the practical implementation of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), the traffic system is expected to remain a mix of CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs) for the foreseeable future. To enhance safety and traffic efficiency, the trajectory planning strategies of CAVs must account for the influence of HVs, necessitating accurate HV trajectory prediction. Current research often assumes that human drivers have perfect knowledge of all vehicles' objectives, an unrealistic premise. This paper bridges the gap by leveraging hypergame theory to account for cognitive and perception limitations in HVs. We model human bounded rationality without assuming them to be merely passive followers and propose a hierarchical cognition modeling framework that captures cognitive relationships among vehicles. We further analyze the cognitive stability of the system, proving that the strategy profile where all vehicles adopt cognitively equilibrium strategies constitutes a hyper Nash equilibrium when CAVs accurately learn HV parameters. To achieve this, we develop an inverse learning algorithm for distributed intention interpretation via vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, which extends the framework to both offline and online scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a distributed trajectory prediction and planning approach for CAVs, leveraging the learned parameters in real time. Simulations in highway lane-changing scenarios demonstrate the proposed method's accuracy in parameter learning, robustness to noisy trajectory observations, and safety in HV trajectory prediction. The results validate the effectiveness of our method in both offline and online implementations.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLMLight: Safety-Critical Traffic Signal Control via Vision-Language Meta-Control and Dual-Branch Reasoning Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19486v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signal control (TSC) is a core challenge in urban mobility, where real-time decisions must balance efficiency and safety. Existing methods - ranging from rule-based heuristics to reinforcement learning (RL) - often struggle to generalize to complex, dynamic, and safety-critical scenarios. We introduce VLMLight, a novel TSC framework that integrates vision-language meta-control with dual-branch reasoning. At the core of VLMLight is the first image-based traffic simulator that enables multi-view visual perception at intersections, allowing policies to reason over rich cues such as vehicle type, motion, and spatial density. A large language model (LLM) serves as a safety-prioritized meta-controller, selecting between a fast RL policy for routine traffic and a structured reasoning branch for critical cases. In the latter, multiple LLM agents collaborate to assess traffic phases, prioritize emergency vehicles, and verify rule compliance. Experiments show that VLMLight reduces waiting times for emergency vehicles by up to 65% over RL-only systems, while preserving real-time performance in standard conditions with less than 1% degradation. VLMLight offers a scalable, interpretable, and safety-aware solution for next-generation traffic signal control.</p></details> | 25 pages, 15 figures |
| **[A Survey and Benchmarking of Spatial-Temporal Traffic Data Imputation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04733v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic data imputation is a critical preprocessing step in intelligent transportation systems, underpinning the reliability of downstream transportation services. Despite substantial progress in imputation models, model selection and development for practical applications remains challenging due to three key gaps: 1) the absence of a model taxonomy for traffic data imputation to trace the technological development and highlight their distinct features. 2) the lack of unified benchmarking pipeline for fair and reproducible model evaluation across standardized traffic datasets. 3) insufficient in-depth analysis that jointly compare models across multiple dimensions, including effectiveness, computational efficiency and robustness. To this end, this paper proposes practice-oriented taxonomies for traffic data missing patterns and imputation models, systematically cataloging real-world traffic data loss scenarios and analyzing the characteristics of existing models. We further introduce a unified benchmarking pipeline to comprehensively evaluate 11 representative models across various missing patterns and rates, assessing overall performance, performance under challenging scenarios, computational efficiency, and providing visualizations. This work aims to provide a holistic perspective on traffic data imputation and to serve as a practical guideline for model selection and application in intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Intention-driven Lane Change Framework Considering Heterogeneous Dynamic Cooperation in Mixed-traffic Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22550v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In mixed-traffic environments, where autonomous vehicles (AVs) interact with diverse human-driven vehicles (HVs), unpredictable intentions and heterogeneous behaviors make safe and efficient lane change maneuvers highly challenging. Existing methods often oversimplify these interactions by assuming uniform patterns. We propose an intention-driven lane change framework that integrates driving-style recognition, cooperation-aware decision-making, and coordinated motion planning. A deep learning classifier trained on the NGSIM dataset identifies human driving styles in real time. A cooperation score with intrinsic and interactive components estimates surrounding drivers' intentions and quantifies their willingness to cooperate with the ego vehicle. Decision-making combines behavior cloning with inverse reinforcement learning to determine whether a lane change should be initiated. For trajectory generation, model predictive control is integrated with IRL-based intention inference to produce collision-free and socially compliant maneuvers. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves 94.2\% accuracy and 94.3\% F1-score, outperforming rule-based and learning-based baselines by 4-15\% in lane change recognition. These results highlight the benefit of modeling inter-driver heterogeneity and demonstrate the potential of the framework to advance context-aware and human-like autonomous driving in complex traffic environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[HOB: A Holistically Optimized Bidding Strategy under Heterogeneous Auction Mechanisms with Organic Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15238v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The E-commerce advertising platforms typically sell commercial traffic through either second-price auction (SPA) or first-price auction (FPA). SPA was historically prevalent due to its dominant strategy incentive-compatible (DSIC) for bidders with quasi-linear utilities, especially when budgets are not a binding constraint, while FPA has gained more prominence for offering higher revenue potential to publishers and avoiding the possibility for discriminatory treatment in personalized reserve prices. Meanwhile, on the demand side, advertisers are increasingly adopting platform-wide marketing solutions akin to QuanZhanTui, shifting from spending budgets solely on commercial traffic to bidding on the entire traffic for the purpose of maximizing overall sales. For automated bidding systems, such a trend poses a critical challenge: determining optimal strategies across heterogeneous auction channels to fulfill diverse advertiser objectives, such as maximizing return (MaxReturn) or meeting target return on ad spend (TargetROAS). To overcome this challenge, this work makes two key contributions. First, we derive an efficient solution for optimal bidding under FPA channels, which takes into account the presence of organic traffic - traffic can be won for free. Second, we introduce a marginal cost alignment (MCA) strategy that provably secures bidding efficiency across heterogeneous auction mechanisms. To validate performance of our developed framework, we conduct comprehensive offline experiments on public datasets and large-scale online A/B testing, which demonstrate consistent improvements over existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatiotemporal Traffic Prediction in Distributed Backend Systems via Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15215v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of traffic prediction in distributed backend systems and proposes a graph neural network based modeling approach to overcome the limitations of traditional models in capturing complex dependencies and dynamic features. The system is abstracted as a graph with nodes and edges, where node features represent traffic and resource states, and adjacency relations describe service interactions. A graph convolution mechanism enables multi order propagation and aggregation of node features, while a gated recurrent structure models historical sequences dynamically, thus integrating spatial structures with temporal evolution. A spatiotemporal joint modeling module further fuses graph representation with temporal dependency, and a decoder generates future traffic predictions. The model is trained with mean squared error to minimize deviations from actual values. Experiments based on public distributed system logs construct combined inputs of node features, topology, and sequences, and compare the proposed method with mainstream baselines using MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. Results show that the proposed method achieves stable performance and low error across different prediction horizons and model depths, significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of traffic forecasting in distributed backend systems and verifying the potential of graph neural networks in complex system modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[FUSE-Traffic: Fusion of Unstructured and Structured Data for Event-aware Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16053v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate traffic forecasting is a core technology for building Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), enabling better urban resource allocation and improved travel experiences. With growing urbanization, traffic congestion has intensified, highlighting the need for reliable and responsive forecasting models. In recent years, deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), has emerged as the mainstream paradigm in traffic forecasting. GNNs can effectively capture complex spatial dependencies in road network topology and dynamic temporal evolution patterns in traffic flow data. Foundational models such as STGCN and GraphWaveNet, along with more recent developments including STWave and D2STGNN, have achieved impressive performance on standard traffic datasets. These approaches incorporate sophisticated graph convolutional structures and temporal modeling mechanisms, demonstrating particular effectiveness in capturing and forecasting traffic patterns characterized by periodic regularities. To address this challenge, researchers have explored various ways to incorporate event information. Early attempts primarily relied on manually engineered event features. For instance, some approaches introduced manually defined incident effect scores or constructed specific subgraphs for different event-induced traffic conditions. While these methods somewhat enhance responsiveness to specific events, their core drawback lies in a heavy reliance on domain experts' prior knowledge, making generalization to diverse and complex unknown events difficult, and low-dimensional manual features often lead to the loss of rich semantic details.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hard-Label Black-Box Evasion Attack against ML-based Malicious Traffic Detection Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14906v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Learning (ML)-based malicious traffic detection is a promising security paradigm. It outperforms rule-based traditional detection by identifying various advanced attacks. However, the robustness of these ML models is largely unexplored, thereby allowing attackers to craft adversarial traffic examples that evade detection. Existing evasion attacks typically rely on overly restrictive conditions (e.g., encrypted protocols, Tor, or specialized setups), or require detailed prior knowledge of the target (e.g., training data and model parameters), which is impractical in realistic black-box scenarios. The feasibility of a hard-label black-box evasion attack (i.e., applicable across diverse tasks and protocols without internal target insights) thus remains an open challenge. To this end, we develop NetMasquerade, which leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to manipulate attack flows to mimic benign traffic and evade detection. Specifically, we establish a tailored pre-trained model called Traffic-BERT, utilizing a network-specialized tokenizer and an attention mechanism to extract diverse benign traffic patterns. Subsequently, we integrate Traffic-BERT into the RL framework, allowing NetMasquerade to effectively manipulate malicious packet sequences based on benign traffic patterns with minimal modifications. Experimental results demonstrate that NetMasquerade enables both brute-force and stealthy attacks to evade 6 existing detection methods under 80 attack scenarios, achieving over 96.65% attack success rate. Notably, it can evade the methods that are either empirically or certifiably robust against existing evasion attacks. Finally, NetMasquerade achieves low-latency adversarial traffic generation, demonstrating its practicality in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Planners Meet Reality: How Learned, Reactive Traffic Agents Shift nuPlan Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14677v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planner evaluation in closed-loop simulation often uses rule-based traffic agents, whose simplistic and passive behavior can hide planner deficiencies and bias rankings. Widely used IDM agents simply follow a lead vehicle and cannot react to vehicles in adjacent lanes, hindering tests of complex interaction capabilities. We address this issue by integrating the state-of-the-art learned traffic agent model SMART into nuPlan. Thus, we are the first to evaluate planners under more realistic conditions and quantify how conclusions shift when narrowing the sim-to-real gap. Our analysis covers 14 recent planners and established baselines and shows that IDM-based simulation overestimates planning performance: nearly all scores deteriorate. In contrast, many planners interact better than previously assumed and even improve in multi-lane, interaction-heavy scenarios like lane changes or turns. Methods trained in closed-loop demonstrate the best and most stable driving performance. However, when reaching their limits in augmented edge-case scenarios, all learned planners degrade abruptly, whereas rule-based planners maintain reasonable basic behavior. Based on our results, we suggest SMART-reactive simulation as a new standard closed-loop benchmark in nuPlan and release the SMART agents as a drop-in alternative to IDM at https://github.com/shgd95/InteractiveClosedLoop.</p></details> |  |

These attacks typically rely on conspicuous stickers and projections, or using invisible light and acoustic signals that can be easily blocked. In this paper, we introduce a novel attack medium, i.e., fluorescent ink, to design a stealthy and effective physical adversarial patch, namely FIPatch, to advance the state-of-the-art. Specifically, we first model the fluorescence effect in the digital domain to identify the optimal attack settings, which guide the real-world fluorescence parameters. By applying a carefully designed fluorescence perturbation to the target sign, the attacker can later trigger a fluorescent effect using invisible ultraviolet light, causing the TSR system to misclassify the sign and potentially leading to traffic accidents. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation to investigate the effectiveness of FIPatch, which shows a success rate of 98.31% in low-light conditions. Furthermore, our attack successfully bypasses five popular defenses and achieves a success rate of 96.72%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stability and Heavy-traffic Delay Optimality of General Load Balancing Policies in Heterogeneous Service Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14284v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a load balancing system consisting of $n$ single-server queues working in parallel, with heterogeneous service rates. Jobs arrive to a central dispatcher, which has to dispatch them to one of the queues immediately upon arrival. For this setting, we consider a broad family of policies where the dispatcher can only access the queue lengths sporadically, every $T$ units of time. We assume that the dispatching decisions are made based only on the order of the scaled queue lengths at the last time that the queues were accessed, and on the processing rate of each server. For these general policies, we provide easily verifiable necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of the system, and sufficient conditions for heavy-traffic delay optimality. We also show that, in heavy-traffic, the queue length converges in distribution to a scaled deterministic vector, where the scaling factor is an exponential random variable.</p></details> |  |
| **[An LLM-Powered AI Agent Framework for Holistic IoT Traffic Interpretation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13925v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Internet of Things (IoT) networks generate diverse and high-volume traffic that reflects both normal activity and potential threats. Deriving meaningful insight from such telemetry requires cross-layer interpretation of behaviors, protocols, and context rather than isolated detection. This work presents an LLM-powered AI agent framework that converts raw packet captures into structured and semantically enriched representations for interactive analysis. The framework integrates feature extraction, transformer-based anomaly detection, packet and flow summarization, threat intelligence enrichment, and retrieval-augmented question answering. An AI agent guided by a large language model performs reasoning over the indexed traffic artifacts, assembling evidence to produce accurate and human-readable interpretations. Experimental evaluation on multiple IoT captures and six open models shows that hybrid retrieval, which combines lexical and semantic search with reranking, substantially improves BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore results compared with dense-only retrieval. System profiling further indicates low CPU, GPU, and memory overhead, demonstrating that the framework achieves holistic and efficient interpretation of IoT network traffic.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory-based real-time pedestrian crash prediction at intersections: A novel non-linear link function for block maxima led Bayesian GEV framework addressing heterogeneous traffic condition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12963v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study develops a real-time framework for estimating pedestrian crash risk at signalized intersections under heterogeneous, non-lane-based traffic. Existing approaches often assume linear relationships between covariates and parameters, oversimplifying the complex, non-monotonic interactions among different road users. To overcome this, the framework introduces a non-linear link function within a Bayesian generalized extreme value (GEV) structure to capture traffic variability more accurately. The framework applies extreme value theory through the block maxima approach using post-encroachment time as a surrogate safety measure. A hierarchical Bayesian model incorporating both linear and non-linear link functions into GEV parameters is estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation. It also introduces a behavior-normalized Modified Crash Risk (MRC) formula to account for pedestrians' habitual risk-taking behavior. Seven Bayesian hierarchical models were developed and compared using deviance information criterion. Models employing non-linear link functions for the location and scale parameters significantly outperformed their linear counterparts. The results revealed that pedestrian speed has a negative relationship with crash risk, while flow and speed of motorized vehicles, pedestrian flow, and non-motorized vehicles conflicting speed contribute positively. The MRC formulation reduced overestimation and provided crash predictions with 93% confidence. The integration of non-linear link functions enhances model flexibility, capturing the non-linear nature of traffic extremes. The proposed MRC metric aligns crash risk estimates with real-world pedestrian behavior in mixed-traffic environments. This framework offers a practical analytical tool for traffic engineers and planners to design adaptive signal control and pedestrian safety interventions before crashes occur.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is a preprint and has not yet been peer-reviewed.

We propose Metronome, a network-aware and priority-aware scheduling mechanism for cloud native networks. This mechanism is designed to support jobs that exhibit periodic traffic patterns and dynamic bandwidth demands, particularly in the context of distributed training. Specifically, Metronome employs a time-division multiplexing approach that leverages job traffic characteristics to construct an elastic network resource allocation model, enabling efficient bandwidth sharing across multiple jobs. In addition, it incorporates a multi-objective optimization strategy, jointly considering latency and job priorities to achieve globally optimal as well as dynamic resource allocation. Finally, Metronome adapts to the dynamic environment by monitoring the cluster and performing reconfiguration operations. Extensive experiments with 13 common machine learning models demonstrate that Metronome can enhance cluster resource utilization while guaranteeing service performance. Compared with the existing Kubernetes scheduling mechanisms across multiple scenarios, Metronome reduces job completion time by up to 19.50% while improving average bandwidth utilization by up to 23.20%.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 16 figures.

| **[Stable and Fault-Tolerant Decentralized Traffic Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11937v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud providers have recently decentralized their wide-area network traffic engineering (TE) systems to contain the impact of TE controller failures. In the decentralized design, a controller fault only impacts its slice of the network, limiting the blast radius to a fraction of the network. However, we find that autonomous slice controllers can arrive at divergent traffic allocations that overload links by 30% beyond their capacity. We present Symphony, a decentralized TE system that addresses the challenge of divergence-induced congestion while preserving the fault-isolation benefits of decentralization. By augmenting TE objectives with quadratic regularization, Symphony makes traffic allocations robust to demand perturbations, ensuring TE controllers naturally converge to compatible allocations without coordination. In parallel, Symphony's randomized slicing algorithm partitions the network to minimize blast radius by distributing critical traffic sources across slices, preventing any single failure from becoming catastrophic. These innovations work in tandem: regularization ensures algorithmic stability to traffic allocations while intelligent slicing provides architectural resilience in the network. Through extensive evaluation on cloud provider WANs, we show Symphony reduces divergence-induced congestion by 14x and blast radius by 79% compared to current practice.</p></details> | 19 pages, 23 figures |

In this work, we present a unique dual-model framework that strategically utilizes the complementary strengths of VideoLLaMA and Qwen2.5-VL through task-specific optimization to address this issue. The core insight behind our approach is that separating training for captioning and visual question answering (VQA) tasks minimizes task interference and allows each model to specialize more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that VideoLLaMA is particularly effective in temporal reasoning, achieving a CIDEr score of 1.1001, while Qwen2.5-VL excels in visual understanding with a VQA accuracy of 60.80\%. Through extensive experiments on the WTS dataset, our method achieves an S2 score of 45.7572 in the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 2, placing 10th on the challenge leaderboard. Ablation studies validate that our separate training strategy outperforms joint training by 8.6\% in VQA accuracy while maintaining captioning quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, their inherent vulnerabilities, combined with widespread adoption, create opportunities for malicious actors to gain unauthorized access or compromise sensitive data stored on connected devices. To address these challenges, we propose a deep learning based network intrusion detection system (NIDS) for Wi-Fi environments. Building on our previous work, we convert network traffic into two-dimensional data representations and use them to train DL models based on convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. We implement five distinct techniques for generating the two-dimensional representations, and to ensure low detection latency, we adopt lightweight CNN architectures in our NIDS. The models are trained using the AWID3 dataset, a publicly available benchmark for Wi-Fi NIDS research, and are evaluated for both binary and multi-class classification tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive detection performance with low inference time, making it suitable for real-world Wi-Fi deployment scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, existing data-driven simulators face two key challenges: a limited focus on modeling dense, heterogeneous interactions at urban intersections - which are prevalent, crucial, and practically significant in countries like China, featuring diverse agents including motorized vehicles (MVs), non-motorized vehicles (NMVs), and pedestrians - and the inherent difficulty in robustly learning high-dimensional joint distributions for such high-density scenes, often leading to mode collapse and long-term simulation instability. We introduce City Crossings Dataset (CiCross), a large-scale dataset collected from a real-world urban intersection, uniquely capturing dense, heterogeneous multi-agent interactions, particularly with a substantial proportion of MVs, NMVs and pedestrians. Based on this dataset, we propose IntersectioNDE (Intersection Naturalistic Driving Environment), a data-driven simulator tailored for complex urban intersection scenarios. Its core component is the Interaction Decoupling Strategy (IDS), a training paradigm that learns compositional dynamics from agent subsets, enabling the marginal-to-joint simulation. Integrated into a scene-aware Transformer network with specialized training techniques, IDS significantly enhances simulation robustness and long-term stability for modeling heterogeneous interactions. Experiments on CiCross show that IntersectioNDE outperforms baseline methods in simulation fidelity, stability, and its ability to replicate complex, distribution-level urban traffic dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ITSC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Vision-LLMs for Spatiotemporal Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11282v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate spatiotemporal traffic forecasting is a critical prerequisite for proactive resource management in dense urban mobile networks. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in time series analysis, they inherently struggle to model the complex spatial dependencies of grid-based traffic data. Effectively extending LLMs to this domain is challenging, as representing the vast amount of information from dense geographical grids can be inefficient and overwhelm the model's context. To address these challenges, we propose ST-Vision-LLM, a novel framework that reframes spatiotemporal forecasting as a vision-language fusion problem. Our approach leverages a Vision-LLM visual encoder to process historical global traffic matrices as image sequences, providing the model with a comprehensive global view to inform cell-level predictions. To overcome the inefficiency of LLMs in handling numerical data, we introduce an efficient encoding scheme that represents floating-point values as single tokens via a specialized vocabulary, coupled with a two-stage numerical alignment fine-tuning process. The model is first trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and then further optimized for predictive accuracy using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a memory-efficient reinforcement learning method. Evaluations on real-world mobile traffic datasets demonstrate that ST-Vision-LLM outperforms existing methods by 15.6% in long-term prediction accuracy and exceeds the second-best baseline by over 30.04% in cross-domain few-shot scenarios. Our extensive experiments validate the model's strong generalization capabilities across various data-scarce environments.</p></details> |  |

We construct two graphs: an undirected graph $\mathcal{G}^u$ capturing spatial correlations across geography, and a directed graph $\mathcal{G}^d$ capturing sequential relationships over time. We predict future samples of signal $\mathbf{x}$, assuming it is "smooth" with respect to both $\mathcal{G}^u$ and $\mathcal{G}^d$, where we design new $\ell_2$ and $\ell_1$-norm variational terms to quantify and promote signal smoothness (low-frequency reconstruction) on a directed graph. We design an iterative algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and unroll it into a feed-forward network for data-driven parameter learning. We insert graph learning modules for $\mathcal{G}^u$ and $\mathcal{G}^d$ that play the role of self-attention. Experiments show that our unrolled networks achieve competitive traffic forecast performance as state-of-the-art prediction schemes, while reducing parameter counts drastically.

This paper presents a multimodal framework combining open-vocabulary visual-language reasoning (CLIP), object detection (YOLO-World), and motion analysis via MOG2-based background subtraction. The system predicts congestion levels on an ordinal scale from 1 (free flow) to 5 (severe congestion), enabling semantically aligned and temporally consistent classification. To enhance interpretability, we incorporate motion-based confidence weighting and generate annotated visual outputs. Experimental results show the model achieves 76.7 percent accuracy, an F1 score of 0.752, and a Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.684, significantly outperforming unimodal baselines. These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in preserving ordinal structure and leveraging visual-language and motion modalities. Future enhancements include incorporating vehicle sizing and refined density metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Multi-Scale Diffusion Transformer for Jointly Simulating User Mobility and Mobile Traffic Pattern](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10158v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User mobility trajectory and mobile traffic data are essential for a wide spectrum of applications including urban planning, network optimization, and emergency management. However, large-scale and fine-grained mobility data remains difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns and collection costs, making it essential to simulate realistic mobility and traffic patterns. User trajectories and mobile traffic are fundamentally coupled, reflecting both physical mobility and cyber behavior in urban environments. Despite this strong interdependence, existing studies often model them separately, limiting the ability to capture cross-modal dynamics. Therefore, a unified framework is crucial. In this paper, we propose MSTDiff, a Multi-Scale Diffusion Transformer for joint simulation of mobile traffic and user trajectories. First, MSTDiff applies discrete wavelet transforms for multi-resolution traffic decomposition. Second, it uses a hybrid denoising network to process continuous traffic volumes and discrete location sequences. A transition mechanism based on urban knowledge graph embedding similarity is designed to guide semantically informed trajectory generation. Finally, a multi-scale Transformer with cross-attention captures dependencies between trajectories and traffic. Experiments show that MSTDiff surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in traffic and trajectory generation tasks, reducing Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) across key statistical metrics by up to 17.38% for traffic generation, and by an average of 39.53% for trajectory generation.

| **[Scaling Traffic Insights with AI and Language Model-Powered Camera Systems for Data-Driven Transportation Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09981v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate, scalable traffic monitoring is critical for real-time and long-term transportation management, particularly during disruptions such as natural disasters, large construction projects, or major policy changes like New York City's first-in-the-nation congestion pricing program. However, widespread sensor deployment remains limited due to high installation, maintenance, and data management costs. While traffic cameras offer a cost-effective alternative, existing video analytics struggle with dynamic camera viewpoints and massive data volumes from large camera networks. This study presents an end-to-end AI-based framework leveraging existing traffic camera infrastructure for high-resolution, longitudinal analysis at scale. A fine-tuned YOLOv11 model, trained on localized urban scenes, extracts multimodal traffic density and classification metrics in real time. To address inconsistencies from non-stationary pan-tilt-zoom cameras, we introduce a novel graph-based viewpoint normalization method. A domain-specific large language model was also integrated to process massive data from a 24/7 video stream to generate frequent, automated summaries of evolving traffic patterns, a task far exceeding manual capabilities. We validated the system using over 9 million images from roughly 1,000 traffic cameras during the early rollout of NYC congestion pricing in 2025. Results show a 9% decline in weekday passenger vehicle density within the Congestion Relief Zone, early truck volume reductions with signs of rebound, and consistent increases in pedestrian and cyclist activity at corridor and zonal scales. Experiments showed that example-based prompts improved LLM's numerical accuracy and reduced hallucinations. These findings demonstrate the framework's potential as a practical, infrastructure-ready solution for large-scale, policy-relevant traffic monitoring with minimal human intervention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Network Traffic as a Scalable Ethnographic Lens for Understanding University Students' AI Tool Practices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09763v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-driven applications have become woven into students' academic and creative workflows, influencing how they learn, write, and produce ideas. Gaining a nuanced understanding of these usage patterns is essential, yet conventional survey and interview methods remain limited by recall bias, self-presentation effects, and the underreporting of habitual behaviors. While ethnographic methods offer richer contextual insights, they often face challenges of scale and reproducibility. To bridge this gap, we introduce a privacy-conscious approach that repurposes VPN-based network traffic analysis as a scalable ethnographic technique for examining students' real-world engagement with AI tools. By capturing anonymized metadata rather than content, this method enables fine-grained behavioral tracing while safeguarding personal information, thereby complementing self-report data. A three-week field deployment with university students reveals fragmented, short-duration interactions across multiple tools and devices, with intense bursts of activity coinciding with exam periods-patterns mirroring institutional rhythms of academic life. We conclude by discussing methodological, ethical, and empirical implications, positioning network traffic analysis as a promising avenue for large-scale digital ethnography on technology-in-practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Traffic-Aware Eco-Driving Control in CAVs via Learning-based Terminal Cost Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08980v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) offer significant potential for improving energy efficiency and lowering vehicle emissions through eco-driving technologies. Control algorithms in CAVs leverage look-ahead route information and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to optimize vehicle performance. However, existing eco-driving strategies often neglect macroscopic traffic effects, such as upstream traffic jams, that occur outside the optimization horizon but significantly impact vehicle energy efficiency. This work presents a novel Neural Network (NN)-based methodology to approximate the terminal cost within a model predictive control (MPC) problem framework, explicitly incorporating upstream traffic dynamics. By incorporating traffic jams into the optimization process, the proposed traffic-aware approach yields more energy-efficient speed trajectories compared to traffic-agnostic methods, with minimal impact on travel time. The framework is scalable for real-time implementation while effectively addressing uncertainties from dynamic traffic conditions and macroscopic traffic events.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Small Vision-Language Models on Distance-Dependent Traffic Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08352v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly powerful, demonstrating strong performance on a variety of tasks that require both visual and textual understanding. Their strong generalisation abilities make them a promising component for automated driving systems, which must handle unexpected corner cases. However, to be trusted in such safety-critical applications, a model must first possess a reliable perception system. Moreover, since critical objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at a distance, we require systems that are not "shortsighted", i.e., systems with strong perception capabilities at both close (up to 20 meters) and long (30+ meters) range. With this in mind, we introduce Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question Answering (DTPQA), the first Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark focused solely on perception-based questions in traffic scenes, enriched with distance annotations. By excluding questions that require reasoning, we ensure that model performance reflects perception capabilities alone. Since automated driving hardware has limited processing power and cannot support large VLMs, our study centers on smaller VLMs. More specifically, we evaluate several state-of-the-art (SOTA) small VLMs on DTPQA and show that, despite the simplicity of the questions, these models significantly underperform compared to humans (~60% average accuracy for the best-performing small VLM versus ~85% human performance). However, it is important to note that the human sample size was relatively small, which imposes statistical limitations. We also identify specific perception tasks, such as distinguishing left from right, that remain particularly challenging for these models.</p></details> |  |

While recent graph neural network approaches have advanced spatial temporal modeling, existing mixture of experts frameworks like Time Enhanced Spatio Temporal Attention Model (TESTAM) lack explicit incorporation of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial capabilities. We present TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio temporal forecasting framework that introduces a novel SpatioSemantic Expert integrating physical road topology with data driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. TESTAM+ achieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA (3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through comprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection fundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts demonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on PEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the SpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The optimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction compared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing inference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+. Our findings reveal that fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex multi expert ensembles, establishing new state of the art performance with superior computational efficiency for real time deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE ICTAI 2025.

We demonstrate that these interactive behaviors leave distinctive fingerprints in encrypted traffic exchanged between users and LLM agents. By analyzing traffic patterns associated with agent workflows and tool invocations, adversaries can infer agent activities, distinguish specific agents, and even profile sensitive user attributes. To highlight this risk, we develop AgentPrint, which achieves an F1-score of 0.866 in agent identification and attains 73.9% and 69.1% top-3 accuracy in user attribute inference for simulated- and real-user settings, respectively. These results uncover an overlooked risk: the very interactivity that empowers LLM agents also exposes user privacy, underscoring the urgent need for technical countermeasures alongside regulatory and policy safeguards.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages with 11 figures</p></details> |
| **[GNN-enhanced Traffic Anomaly Detection for Next-Generation SDN-Enabled Consumer Electronics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07109v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consumer electronics (CE) connected to the Internet of Things are susceptible to various attacks, including DDoS and web-based threats, which can compromise their functionality and facilitate remote hijacking. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to exploit CE for broader system attacks while enabling the propagation of malicious code across the CE network, resulting in device failures. Existing deep learning-based traffic anomaly detection systems exhibit high accuracy in traditional network environments but are often overly complex and reliant on static infrastructure, necessitating manual configuration and management. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable network model that integrates Software-defined Networking (SDN) and Compute First Networking (CFN) for next-generation CE networks. In this network model, we propose a Graph Neural Networks-based Network Anomaly Detection framework (GNN-NAD) that integrates SDN-based CE networks and enables the CFN architecture. GNN-NAD uniquely fuses a static, vulnerability-aware attack graph with dynamic traffic features, providing a holistic view of network security. The core of the framework is a GNN model (GSAGE) for graph representation learning, followed by a Random Forest (RF) classifier. This design (GSAGE+RF) demonstrates superior performance compared to existing feature selection methods. Experimental evaluations on CE environment reveal that GNN-NAD achieves superior metrics in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score, even with small sample sizes, exceeding the performance of current network anomaly detection methods. This work advances the security and efficiency of next-generation intelligent CE networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics. 10 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

To tackle this issue, past research has explored the applicability of traffic correlation techniques to perform attack attribution, i.e., to identify an attacker's true network location. However, current traffic correlation approaches rely on well-provisioned and centralized systems that ingest flows from multiple network probes to compute correlation scores. Unfortunately, this makes correlation efforts scale poorly for large high-speed networks. In this paper, we propose RevealNet, a decentralized framework for attack attribution that orchestrates a fleet of P4-programmable switches to perform traffic correlation. RevealNet builds on a set of correlation primitives inspired by prior work on computing and comparing flow sketches -- compact summaries of flows' key characteristics -- to enable efficient, distributed, in-network traffic correlation. Our evaluation suggests that RevealNet achieves comparable accuracy to centralized attack attribution systems while significantly reducing both the computational complexity and bandwidth overheads imposed by correlation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 23rd IEEE International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications (NCA)</p></details> |

Behavior cloning suffers from covariate shift, while Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) is notoriously unstable in multi-agent settings. We identify a key source of this instability: irrelevant interaction misguidance, where a discriminator penalizes an ego vehicle's realistic behavior due to unrealistic interactions among its neighbors. To address this, we propose Decomposed Multi-agent GAIL (DecompGAIL), which explicitly decomposes realism into ego-map and ego-neighbor components, filtering out misleading neighbor: neighbor and neighbor: map interactions. We further introduce a social PPO objective that augments ego rewards with distance-weighted neighborhood rewards, encouraging overall realism across agents. Integrated into a lightweight SMART-based backbone, DecompGAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WOMD Sim Agents 2025 benchmark.</p></details> |  |

TSN combines priority queuing, traffic scheduling, and the Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) to carry periodic traffic with ultra-low latency and jitter. That is, so-called Talkers send periodic traffic with highest priority according to a schedule. The schedule is designed such that the scheduled traffic is forwarded by the TSN bridges with no or only little queuing delay. To protect that traffic against other frames, the TAS is configured on all interfaces such that lower-priority queues can send only when high-priority traffic is not supposed to be forwarded. In the literature on scheduling algorithms for the TAS there is mostly the explicit or implicit assumption that the TAS also limits transmission slots of high-priority traffic. In this paper we show that this assumption can lead to tremendous problems like very long queuing delay or even packet loss in case of faulty frames. A faulty frame arrives too early or too late according to the schedule, it is missing or additional. We construct minimal examples to illustrate basic effects of faulty frames on a single link and demonstrate how this effect can propagate through the networks and cause remote problems. We further show using simulations that a single slightly delayed frame may lead to frame loss on multiple links. We show that these problems can be alleviated or avoided when TAS-based transmission slots for high-priority traffic are configured longer than needed or if they are not limited at all.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating UORA-Based Polling Mechanism for Latency-Sensitive Uplink Traffic in Wi-Fi Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04731v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>IEEE 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) introduced Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), which enables simultaneous transmissions through centralized resource allocation. However, effective uplink scheduling requires the Access Point (AP) to identify which stations (STAs) have data to transmit. This typically necessitates polling for buffer status reports, a process that becomes increasingly inefficient and unscalable with growing device density. In this paper, we study how the Uplink OFDMA-based Random Access (UORA) feature improves the scalability and delay experienced by latency-sensitive data streams. We show that UORA enables efficient uplink scheduling while opportunistically identifying buffered traffic from unscheduled STAs, striking a balance between coordination and scalability. Performance evaluation of different polling strategies is done by means of simulation in ns-3. The results indicate that UORA-based polling outperforms alternative schemes in densely deployed network environments with heterogeneous uplink traffic patterns. Furthermore, under highly sparse and sporadic traffic conditions, UORA-based polling yields over 40% delay reduction compared to Scheduled Access (SA) OFDMA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating mixed traffic dynamics of pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles at urban intersections: Observation experiments and modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04423v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban intersections with mixed pedestrian and non-motorized vehicle traffic present complex safety challenges, yet traditional models fail to account for dynamic interactions arising from speed heterogeneity and collision anticipation. This study introduces the Time and Angle Based Social Force Model (TASFM), an enhanced framework extending the classical Social Force Model by integrating Time-to-Collision (TTC) metrics and velocity-angle-dependent tangential forces to simulate collision avoidance behaviors more realistically. Using aerial trajectory data from a high-density intersection in Shenzhen, China, we validated TASFM against real-world scenarios, achieving a Mean Trajectory Error (MTE) of 0.154 m (0.77% of the experimental area width). Key findings reveal distinct behavioral patterns: pedestrians self-organize into lanes along designated routes (e.g., zebra crossings), while non-motorized vehicles exhibit flexible path deviations that heighten collision risks. Simulations of three conflict types (overtaking, frontal/lateral crossing) demonstrate TASFM's capacity to replicate adaptive strategies like bidirectional path adjustments and speed modulation. The model provides actionable insights for urban planners, including conflict hotspot prediction and infrastructure redesign (e.g., segregated lanes), while offering a scalable framework for future research integrating motorized traffic and environmental variables. This work advances the understanding of mixed traffic dynamics and bridges the gap between theoretical modeling and data-driven urban safety solutions.</p></details> |  |

The strategy is formulated as a lexicographic multi-objective optimization problem, starting with the regulation of traffic inflows at boundary junctions to maximize the capacity while ensuring a smooth operation of the UTN. Following this, the signal timings at internal junctions are collaboratively optimized to enhance overall traffic conditions under the regulated inflows. The use of a model predictive control (MPC) approach ensures that the control solution adheres to safety and capacity constraints within the network. To address the computational complexity of the problem, the UTN is divided into subnetworks, each managed by a local agent. A distributed solution method based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is employed, allowing each agent to determine its optimal control decisions using local information from its subnetwork and neighboring agents. Numerical simulations using VISSIM and MATLAB demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed traffic control strategy.</p></details> |  |

Conventional systems relying on static signals and manual monitoring are inadequate for the dynamic nature of modern traffic. This research aims to develop a unified framework that integrates CCTV surveillance videos with multi-source data descriptors to enhance real-time urban traffic prediction. The proposed methodology incorporates spatio-temporal feature fusion, Frequent Episode Mining for sequential traffic pattern discovery, and a hybrid LSTM-Transformer model for robust traffic state forecasting. The framework was evaluated on the CityFlowV2 dataset comprising 313,931 annotated bounding boxes across 46 cameras. It achieved a high prediction accuracy of 98.46 percent, with a macro precision of 0.9800, macro recall of 0.9839, and macro F1-score of 0.9819. FEM analysis revealed significant sequential patterns such as moderate-congested transitions with confidence levels exceeding 55 percent. The 46 sustained congestion alerts are system-generated, which shows practical value for proactive congestion management. This emphasizes the need for the incorporation of video stream analytics with data from multiple sources for the design of real-time, responsive, adaptable multi-level intelligent transportation systems, which makes urban mobility smarter and safer.</p></details> | 24 pages, 9 figures |

In this study, we propose a data-driven framework that integrates MOVES and open-source GPS trajectory data, OpenStreetMap (OSM) road networks, regional traffic datasets and satellite imagery-derived feature vectors to estimate the link level operating mode distribution and traffic emissions. A neural network model is trained to predict the distribution of MOVES-defined operating modes using only features derived from readily available data. The proposed methodology was applied using open-source data related to 45 municipalities in the Boston Metropolitan area. The "ground truth" operating mode distribution was established using OSM open-source GPS trajectories. Compared to the MOVES baseline, the proposed model reduces RMSE by over 50% for regional scale traffic emissions of key pollutants including CO, NOx, CO2, and PM2.5. This study demonstrates the feasibility of low-cost, replicable, and data-driven emissions estimation using fully open data sources.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequence-Preserving Dual-FoV Defense for Traffic Sign and Light Recognition in Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02642v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic light and sign recognition are key for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) because perception mistakes directly influence navigation and safety. In addition to digital adversarial attacks, models are vulnerable to existing perturbations (glare, rain, dirt, or graffiti), which could lead to dangerous misclassifications. The current work lacks consideration of temporal continuity, multistatic field-of-view (FoV) sensing, and robustness to both digital and natural degradation. This study proposes a dual FoV, sequence-preserving robustness framework for traffic lights and signs in the USA based on a multi-source dataset built on aiMotive, Udacity, Waymo, and self-recorded videos from the region of Texas. Mid and long-term sequences of RGB images are temporally aligned for four operational design domains (ODDs): highway, night, rainy, and urban. Over a series of experiments on a real-life application of anomaly detection, this study outlines a unified three-layer defense stack framework that incorporates feature squeezing, defensive distillation, and entropy-based anomaly detection, as well as sequence-wise temporal voting for further enhancement. The evaluation measures included accuracy, attack success rate (ASR), risk-weighted misclassification severity, and confidence stability. Physical transferability was confirmed using probes for recapture. The results showed that the Unified Defense Stack achieved 79.8mAP and reduced the ASR to 18.2%, which is superior to YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and BEVFormer, while reducing the high-risk misclassification to 32%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Grained Urban Traffic Forecasting on Metropolis-Scale Road Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02278v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting on road networks is a complex task of significant practical importance that has recently attracted considerable attention from the machine learning community, with spatiotemporal graph neural networks (GNNs) becoming the most popular approach. The proper evaluation of traffic forecasting methods requires realistic datasets, but current publicly available benchmarks have significant drawbacks, including the absence of information about road connectivity for road graph construction, limited information about road properties, and a relatively small number of road segments that falls short of real-world applications. Further, current datasets mostly contain information about intercity highways with sparsely located sensors, while city road networks arguably present a more challenging forecasting task due to much denser roads and more complex urban traffic patterns. In this work, we provide a more complete, realistic, and challenging benchmark for traffic forecasting by releasing datasets representing the road networks of two major cities, with the largest containing almost 100,000 road segments (more than a 10-fold increase relative to existing datasets). Our datasets contain rich road features and provide fine-grained data about both traffic volume and traffic speed, allowing for building more holistic traffic forecasting systems. We show that most current implementations of neural spatiotemporal models for traffic forecasting have problems scaling to datasets of our size. To overcome this issue, we propose an alternative approach to neural traffic forecasting that uses a GNN without a dedicated module for temporal sequence processing, thus achieving much better scalability, while also demonstrating stronger forecasting performance. We hope our datasets and modeling insights will serve as a valuable resource for research in traffic forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Low Power Traffic Pattern for Energy Constrained Wireless Sensor Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00588v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are extensively utilized in critical applications, including remote monitoring, target tracking, healthcare systems, industrial automation, and smart control in both residential and industrial settings. One of the primary challenges in these systems is maintaining energy efficiency, given that most sensor nodes rely on limited battery resources. To tackle this problem, this study introduces an energy-saving strategy designed for tree-structured networks with dynamic traffic patterns. The approach focuses on lowering power usage by decreasing the length and occurrence of idle listening state where nodes remain active unnecessarily while waiting for data transmissions that may never occur. By reducing this form of energy waste, the proposed approach is designed to extend the operational lifetime and enhance the throughput of the wireless sensor network. Simulation results obtained using the OMNeT++ simulator with the MiXiM framework demonstrate that the solution significantly reduces energy consumption, increases data throughput, and improves overall network efficiency and longevity.</p></details> |  |

| **[Causal Graph Neural Networks for Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02531v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare artificial intelligence systems routinely fail when deployed across institutions, with documented performance drops and perpetuation of discriminatory patterns embedded in historical data. This brittleness stems, in part, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms. Causal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift, discrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of biomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms rather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological foundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal representation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and counterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating clinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis, cancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological monitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting prescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific Causal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with integration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph neural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain, including computational requirements precluding real-time deployment, validation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond cross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal terminology without rigorous evidentiary support. We propose tiered frameworks distinguishing causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated discoveries and identify critical research priorities making causal rather than purely associational claims.</p></details> |  |

However, in GNSS-denied areas, satellite-based localization methods are prone to failure. This paper presents a cross-view UAV localization framework that performs map matching via object detection, aimed at effectively addressing cross-temporal, cross-view, heterogeneous aerial image matching. In typical pipelines, UAV visual localization is formulated as an image-retrieval problem: features are extracted to build a localization map, and the pose of a query image is estimated by matching it to a reference database with known poses. Because publicly available UAV localization datasets are limited, many approaches recast localization as a classification task and rely on scene labels in these datasets to ensure accuracy. Other methods seek to reduce cross-domain differences using polar-coordinate reprojection, perspective transformations, or generative adversarial networks; however, they can suffer from misalignment, content loss, and limited realism. In contrast, we leverage modern object detection to accurately extract salient instances from UAV and satellite images, and integrate a graph neural network to reason about inter-image and intra-image node relationships. Using a fine-grained, graph-based node-similarity metric, our method achieves strong retrieval and localization performance. Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show that our approach handles heterogeneous appearance differences effectively and generalizes well, making it applicable to scenarios with larger modality gaps, such as infrared-visible image matching. Our dataset will be publicly available at the following URL: https://github.com/liutao23/ODGNNLoc.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, Submitted to IEEE TIM</p></details> |
| **[Using ensemble learning with hybrid graph neural networks and transformers to predict traffic in cities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02484v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) still have a hard time accurately predicting traffic in cities, especially in big, multimodal settings with complicated spatiotemporal dynamics. This paper presents HybridST, a hybrid architecture that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), multi-head temporal Transformers, and supervised ensemble learning methods (XGBoost or Random Forest) to collectively capture spatial dependencies, long-range temporal patterns, and exogenous signals, including weather, calendar, or control states. We test our model on the METR-LA, PEMS-BAY, and Seattle Loop tree public benchmark datasets. These datasets include situations ranging from freeway sensor networks to vehicle-infrastructure cooperative perception. Experimental results show that HybridST consistently beats classical baselines (LSTM, GCN, DCRNN, PDFormer) on important metrics like MAE and RMSE, while still being very scalable and easy to understand. The proposed framework presents a promising avenue for real-time urban mobility planning, energy optimization, and congestion alleviation strategies, especially within the framework of smart cities and significant events such as the 2030 FIFA World Cup.</p></details> |  |
| **[Link Prediction with Untrained Message Passing Layers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16687v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message passing neural networks (MPNNs) operate on graphs by exchanging information between neigbouring nodes. MPNNs have been successfully applied to various node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks in areas like molecular science, computer vision, natural language processing, and combinatorial optimization. However, most MPNNs require training on large amounts of labeled data, which can be costly and time-consuming. In this work, we explore the use of various untrained message passing layers in graph neural networks, i.e. variants of popular message passing architecture where we remove all trainable parameters that are used to transform node features in the message passing step. Focusing on link prediction, we find that untrained message passing layers can lead to competitive and even superior performance compared to fully trained MPNNs, especially in the presence of high-dimensional features. We provide a theoretical analysis of untrained message passing by relating the inner products of features implicitly produced by untrained message passing layers to path-based topological node similarity measures. As such, untrained message passing architectures can be viewed as a highly efficient and interpretable approach to link prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolving Graph Learning for Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Non-stationary Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02354v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks have shown remarkable success in exploiting the spatial and temporal patterns on dynamic graphs. However, existing GNNs exhibit poor generalization ability under distribution shifts, which is inevitable in dynamic scenarios. As dynamic graph generation progresses amid evolving latent non-stationary environments, it is imperative to explore their effects on out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. This paper proposes a novel Evolving Graph Learning framework for OOD generalization (EvoOOD) by environment-aware invariant pattern recognition. Specifically, we first design an environment sequential variational auto-encoder to model environment evolution and infer the underlying environment distribution. Then, we introduce a mechanism for environment-aware invariant pattern recognition, tailored to address environmental diversification through inferred distributions. Finally, we conduct fine-grained causal interventions on individual nodes using a mixture of instantiated environment samples. This approach helps to distinguish spatio-temporal invariant patterns for OOD prediction, especially in non-stationary environments. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of EvoGOOD on both real-world and synthetic dynamic datasets under distribution shifts. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to study the dynamic graph OOD generalization problem from the environment evolution perspective.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable Graph Neural Architecture Search via Monte-Carlo Tree Search (Full version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15734v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The number of graph neural network (GNN) architectures has increased rapidly due to the growing adoption of graph analysis. Although we use GNNs in wide application scenarios, it is a laborious task to design/select optimal GNN architectures in diverse graphs. To reduce human efforts, graph neural architecture search (Graph NAS) has been used to search for a sub-optimal GNN architecture that combines existing components. However, existing Graph NAS methods lack explainability to understand the reasons why the model architecture is selected because they use complex search space and neural models to select architecture. Therefore, we propose an explainable Graph NAS method, called ExGNAS, which consists of (i) a simple search space that can adapt to various graphs and (ii) a search algorithm with Monte-Carlo tree that makes the decision process explainable. The combination of our search space and algorithm achieves finding accurate GNN models and the important functions within the search space. We comprehensively evaluate ExGNAS compared with four state-of-the-art Graph NAS methods in twelve graphs. Our experimental results show that ExGNAS achieves high average accuracy and efficiency; improving accuracy up to 26.1% and reducing run time up to 88%. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of explainability by questionnaire-based user study and architecture analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[UFGraphFR: Graph Federation Recommendation System based on User Text description features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08044v4)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning offers a privacy-preserving framework for recommendation systems by enabling local data processing; however, data localization introduces substantial obstacles. Traditional federated recommendation approaches treat each user as an isolated entity, failing to construct global user relationship graphs that capture collaborative signals, which limits the accuracy of recommendations. To address this limitation, we derive insight from the insight that semantic similarity reflects preference. similarity, which can be used to improve the construction of user relationship graphs. This paper proposes UFGraphFR, a novel framework with three key components: 1) On the client side, private structured data is first transformed into text descriptions. These descriptions are then encoded into semantic vectors using pre-trained models; 2) On the server side, user relationship graphs are securely reconstructed using aggregated model weights without accessing raw data, followed by information propagation through lightweight graph neural networks; 3) On the client side, user behavior sequences are personalized using Transformer architectures. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that UFGraphFR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both recommendation accuracy and personalization. The framework also maintains robustness across different pre-trained models, as evidenced by the consistent performance metrics obtained. This work provides a practical method for efficient federated recommendations with strict privacy by using semantic vectors, secure user relationship graphs, and personalized behavior sequences.

Automated detection of MDD using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and deep learning (DL) methods holds increasing promise for improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling early intervention. Most existing methods employ either voxel-level features or handcrafted regional representations built from predefined brain atlases, limiting their ability to capture complex brain patterns. This paper develops a unified pipeline that utilizes Vision Transformers (ViTs) for extracting 3D region embeddings from sMRI data and Graph Neural Network (GNN) for classification. We explore two strategies for defining regions: (1) an atlas-based approach using predefined structural and functional brain atlases, and (2) an cube-based method by which ViTs are trained directly to identify regions from uniformly extracted 3D patches. Further, cosine similarity graphs are generated to model interregional relationships, and guide GNN-based classification. Extensive experiments were conducted using the REST-meta-MDD dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. With stratified 10-fold cross-validation, the best model obtained 81.51\% accuracy, 85.94\% sensitivity, 76.36\% specificity, 80.88\% precision, and 83.33\% F1-score. Further, atlas-based models consistently outperformed the cube-based approach, highlighting the importance of using domain-specific anatomical priors for MDD detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figure, 9 tables</p></details> |

A deep BLSTM network is used for symbol segmentation, recognition, and spatial relation classification, forming an initial primitive graph. A 2D-CFG parser then generates all possible spatial relations, while the GNN-based link prediction model refines the structure by removing unnecessary connections, ultimately forming the Symbol Label Graph. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing promising performance in HME structure recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for ICDAR2025-WML</p></details> |
| **[PrivGNN: High-Performance Secure Inference for Cryptographic Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02185v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for analyzing and learning from graph-structured (GS) data, facilitating a wide range of services. Deploying such services in privacy-critical cloud environments necessitates the development of secure inference (SI) protocols that safeguard sensitive GS data. However, existing SI solutions largely focus on convolutional models for image and text data, leaving the challenge of securing GNNs and GS data relatively underexplored. In this work, we design, implement, and evaluate $\sysname$, a lightweight cryptographic scheme for graph-centric inference in the cloud. By hybridizing additive and function secret sharings within secure two-party computation (2PC), $\sysname$ is carefully designed based on a series of novel 2PC interactive protocols that achieve $1.5\times \sim 1.7\times$ speedups for linear layers and $2\times \sim 15\times$ for non-linear layers over state-of-the-art (SotA) solutions. A thorough theoretical analysis is provided to prove $\sysname$'s correctness, security, and lightweight nature. Extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate $\sysname$'s superior efficiency with $1.3\times \sim 4.7\times$ faster secure predictions while maintaining accuracy comparable to plaintext graph property inference.</p></details> | Accepted to FC'25 |

The critical seed chaining step must connect exact k-mer matches between reads and reference genomes while filtering spurious matches, yet state-of-the-art methods rely on fixed gap penalty functions unable to adapt to varying genomic contexts including tandem repeats and structural variants. This paper presents RawHash3, a hybrid framework combining graph neural networks with classical dynamic programming for adaptive seed chaining that maintains real-time performance while providing statistical guarantees. We formalize seed chaining as graph learning where seeds constitute nodes with 12-dimensional feature vectors and edges encode 8-dimensional spatial relationships including gap consistency. Our architecture employs three-layer EdgeConv GNN with confidence-based method selection that dynamically switches between learned guidance and algorithmic fallback. Comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 synthetic nanopore reads with 5,200 test seeds demonstrates RawHash3 achieves 99.94 percent precision and 40.07 percent recall, representing statistically significant 25.0 percent relative improvement over baseline with p less than 0.001. The system maintains median inference latency of 1.59ms meeting real-time constraints, while demonstrating superior robustness with 100 percent success rate under 20 percent label corruption versus baseline degradation to 30.3 percent. Cross-validation confirms stability establishing graph neural networks as viable approach for production genomics pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 12 figures, 6 tables.

However, are LLMs strictly necessary, or can smaller, domain-grounded models suffice? We identify a large class of simulation problems in which individuals make choices among discrete options, where a graph neural network (GNN) can match or surpass strong LLM baselines despite being three orders of magnitude smaller. We introduce Graph-basEd Models for human Simulation (GEMS), which casts discrete choice simulation tasks as a link prediction problem on graphs, leveraging relational knowledge while incorporating language representations only when needed. Evaluations across three key settings on three simulation datasets show that GEMS achieves comparable or better accuracy than LLMs, with far greater efficiency, interpretability, and transparency, highlighting the promise of graph-based modeling as a lightweight alternative to LLMs for human simulation.

The objective of this systematic literature review is hence to provide a comprehensive overview of the various modeling approaches and application domains of GNNs for time series classification and forecasting. A database search was conducted, and 366 papers were selected for a detailed examination of the current state-of-the-art in the field. This examination is intended to offer to the reader a comprehensive review of proposed models, links to related source code, available datasets, benchmark models, and fitting results. All this information is hoped to assist researchers in their studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and broadest systematic literature review presenting a detailed comparison of results from current spatio-temporal GNN models applied to different domains. In its final part, this review discusses current limitations and challenges in the application of spatio-temporal GNNs, such as comparability, reproducibility, explainability, poor information capacity, and scalability. This paper is complemented by a GitHub repository at https://github.com/FlaGer99/SLR-Spatio-Temporal-GNN.git providing additional interactive tools to further explore the presented findings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Microbial Interactions Using Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02038v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting interspecies interactions is a key challenge in microbial ecology, as these interactions are critical to determining the structure and activity of microbial communities. In this work, we used data on monoculture growth capabilities, interactions with other species, and phylogeny to predict a negative or positive effect of interactions. More precisely, we used one of the largest available pairwise interaction datasets to train our models, comprising over 7,500 interactions be- tween 20 species from two taxonomic groups co-cultured under 40 distinct carbon conditions, with a primary focus on the work of Nestor et al.[28 ]. In this work, we propose Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as a powerful classifier to predict the direction of the effect. We construct edge-graphs of pairwise microbial interactions in order to leverage shared information across individual co-culture experiments, and use GNNs to predict modes of interaction. Our model can not only predict binary interactions (positive/negative) but also classify more complex interaction types such as mutualism, competition, and parasitism. Our initial results were encouraging, achieving an F1-score of 80.44%. This significantly outperforms comparable methods in the literature, including conventional Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models, which reported an F1-score of 72.76%.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, NeurIPS 2025 Workshop New Perspectives in Graph Machine Learning</p></details> |
| **[E2Former: An Efficient and Equivariant Transformer with Linear-Scaling Tensor Products](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19216v4)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) have demonstrated significant success in modeling microscale systems, including those in chemistry, biology and materials science. However, EGNNs face substantial computational challenges due to the high cost of constructing edge features via spherical tensor products, making them impractical for large-scale systems. To address this limitation, we introduce E2Former, an equivariant and efficient transformer architecture that incorporates the Wigner $6j$ convolution (Wigner $6j$ Conv). By shifting the computational burden from edges to nodes, the Wigner $6j$ Conv reduces the complexity from $O(|\mathcal{E}|)$ to $ O(| \mathcal{V}|)$ while preserving both the model's expressive power and rotational equivariance. We show that this approach achieves a 7x-30x speedup compared to conventional $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ convolutions. Furthermore, our empirical results demonstrate that the derived E2Former mitigates the computational challenges of existing approaches without compromising the ability to capture detailed geometric information. This development could suggest a promising direction for scalable and efficient molecular modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[RELATE: A Schema-Agnostic Perceiver Encoder for Multimodal Relational Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19954v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relational multi-table data is common in domains such as e-commerce, healthcare, and scientific research, and can be naturally represented as heterogeneous temporal graphs with multi-modal node attributes. Existing graph neural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring separate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders scalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for Latent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature encoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that aggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node representation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark, where it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while reducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and enables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way toward foundation models for relational graph data.</p></details> | 6 pages |

A crucial goal is to extract insights from this data that shed light on the nature and composition of the Universe. In this paper we introduce CosmoBench, a benchmark dataset curated from state-of-the-art cosmological simulations whose runs required more than 41 million core-hours and generated over two petabytes of data. CosmoBench is the largest dataset of its kind: it contains 34 thousand point clouds from simulations of dark matter halos and galaxies at three different length scales, as well as 25 thousand directed trees that record the formation history of halos on two different time scales. The data in CosmoBench can be used for multiple tasks -- to predict cosmological parameters from point clouds and merger trees, to predict the velocities of individual halos and galaxies from their collective positions, and to reconstruct merger trees on finer time scales from those on coarser time scales. We provide several baselines on these tasks, some based on established approaches from cosmological modeling and others rooted in machine learning. For the latter, we study different approaches -- from simple linear models that are minimally constrained by symmetries to much larger and more computationally-demanding models in deep learning, such as graph neural networks. We find that least-squares fits with a handful of invariant features sometimes outperform deep architectures with many more parameters and far longer training time. Still there remains tremendous potential to improve these baselines by combining machine learning and cosmology to fully exploit the data. CosmoBench sets the stage for bridging cosmology and geometric deep learning at scale.

Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (QLDPC) codes have emerged as a promising solution for scalable Quantum Error Correction (QEC) applications by supporting constant-rate encoding and a sparse parity-check structure. However, decoding QLDPC codes via traditional approaches such as Belief Propagation (BP) suffers from poor convergence in the presence of short cycles. Machine learning techniques like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) utilize learned message passing over their node features; however, they are restricted to pairwise interactions on Tanner graphs, which limits their ability to capture higher-order correlations. In this work, we propose HyperNQ, the first Hypergraph Neural Network (HGNN)- based QLDPC decoder that captures higher-order stabilizer constraints by utilizing hyperedges-thus enabling highly expressive and compact decoding. We use a two-stage message passing scheme and evaluate the decoder over the pseudo-threshold region. Below the pseudo-threshold mark, HyperNQ improves the Logical Error Rate (LER) up to 84% over BP and 50% over GNN-based strategies, demonstrating enhanced performance over the existing state-of-the-art decoders.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, Submitted to the IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC 2026).

| **[GraphTeam: Facilitating Large Language Model-based Graph Analysis via Multi-Agent Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18032v5)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are widely used for modeling relational data in real-world scenarios, such as social networks and urban computing. Existing LLM-based graph analysis approaches either integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) for specific machine learning tasks, limiting their transferability, or rely solely on LLMs' internal reasoning ability, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we take advantage of recent advances in LLM-based agents, which have shown capabilities of utilizing external knowledge or tools for problem solving. By simulating human problem-solving strategies such as analogy and collaboration, we propose a multi-agent system based on LLMs named GraphTeam, for graph analysis. GraphTeam consists of five LLM-based agents from three modules, and the agents with different specialities can collaborate with each other to address complex problems. Specifically, (1) input-output normalization module: the question agent extracts and refines four key arguments from the original question, facilitating the problem understanding, and the answer agent organizes the results to meet the output requirement; (2) external knowledge retrieval module: we first build a knowledge base consisting of relevant documentation and experience information, and then the search agent retrieves the most relevant entries for each question. (3) problem-solving module: given the retrieved information from search agent, the coding agent uses established algorithms via programming to generate solutions, and in case the coding agent does not work, the reasoning agent will directly compute the results without programming. Extensive experiments on six graph analysis benchmarks demonstrate that GraphTeam achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average 25.85% improvement over the best baseline in terms of accuracy.

As more and more users move towards cloud computing, it has become a critical issue to unleash the power of GNNs while protecting the privacy in cloud environments. Specifically, the training data and inference data for GNNs need to be protected from being stolen by external adversaries. Meanwhile, the financial cost of cloud computing is another primary concern for users. Therefore, although existing studies have proposed privacy-preserving techniques for GNNs in cloud environments, their additional computational and communication overhead remain relatively high, causing high financial costs that limit their widespread adoption among users. To protect GNN privacy while lowering the additional financial costs, we introduce Panther, a cost-effective privacy-preserving framework for GNN training and inference services in cloud environments. Technically, Panther leverages four-party computation to asynchronously executing the secure array access protocol, and randomly pads the neighbor information of GNN nodes. We prove that Panther can protect privacy for both training and inference of GNN models. Our evaluation shows that Panther reduces the training and inference time by an average of 75.28% and 82.80%, respectively, and communication overhead by an average of 52.61% and 50.26% compared with the state-of-the-art, which is estimated to save an average of 55.05% and 59.00% in financial costs (based on on-demand pricing model) for the GNN training and inference process on Google Cloud Platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Services Computing (TSC)</p></details> |

However, its network structure evolves dynamically under the influence of geopolitical, economic, and environmental factors, making it challenging to model and predict future trade links. Effectively capturing temporal patterns in food trade networks is therefore essential for improving the accuracy and robustness of link prediction. This study introduces IVGAE-TAMA-BO, a novel dynamic graph neural network designed to model evolving trade structures and predict future links in global food trade networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply dynamic graph neural networks to this domain, significantly enhancing predictive performance. Building upon the original IVGAE framework, the proposed model incorporates a Trade-Aware Momentum Aggregator (TAMA) to capture the temporal evolution of trade networks, jointly modeling short-term fluctuations and long-term structural dependencies. A momentum-based structural memory mechanism further improves predictive stability and performance. In addition, Bayesian optimization is used to automatically tune key hyperparameters, enhancing generalization across diverse trade scenarios. Extensive experiments on five crop-specific datasets demonstrate that IVGAE-TAMA substantially outperforms the static IVGAE and other dynamic baselines by effectively modeling temporal dependencies, while Bayesian optimization further boosts performance in IVGAE-TAMA-BO. These results highlight the proposed framework as a robust and scalable solution for structural prediction in global trade networks, with strong potential for applications in food security monitoring and policy decision support.</p></details> | 26pages,6figures |

However, their expressiveness ability is limited by: (1) Existing methods often overlook the over-smoothing issue caused by traditional GNN models, as well as the gradient explosion or vanishing problems in deep GNNs. (2) Most models operate on first-order information, neglecting that the real world often consists of second-order systems, which further limits the model's representation capabilities. To address these issues, we propose the \textbf{Du}al \textbf{S}econd-order \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{G}raph \textbf{O}rdinary Differential Equation (\method{}) for equivariant representation. Specifically, \method{} apply the dual second-order equivariant graph ordinary differential equations (Graph ODEs) on graph embeddings and node coordinates, simultaneously. Theoretically, we first prove that \method{} maintains the equivariant property. Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights showing that \method{} effectively alleviates the over-smoothing problem in both feature representation and coordinate update. Additionally, we demonstrate that the proposed \method{} mitigates the exploding and vanishing gradients problem, facilitating the training of deep multi-layer GNNs. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of the proposed \method{} compared to baselines.</p></details> |  |

Although multi-scale Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) hold potential for modeling these relationships, they frequently neglect two key points: the subtle intra-attribute patterns within each stock affecting inter-stock correlation, and the biased attention to coarse- and fine-grained features during multi-scale sampling. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MS-HGFN (Multi-Scale Hierarchical Graph Fusion Network). The model features a hierarchical GNN module that forms dynamic graphs by learning patterns from intra-attributes and features from inter-attributes over different time scales, thus comprehensively capturing spatio-temporal dependencies. Additionally, a top-down gating approach facilitates the integration of multi-scale spatio-temporal features, preserving critical coarse- and fine-grained features without too much interference. Experiments utilizing real-world datasets from U.S. and Chinese stock markets demonstrate that MS-HGFN outperforms both traditional and advanced models, yielding up to a 1.4% improvement in prediction accuracy and enhanced stability in return simulations.

Increased particle multiplicities are straining latency and storage requirements at the data acquisition stage, while new complications are emerging, including higher background levels and more frequent particle vertex misassociations. This in turn necessitates the development of more holistic and scalable reconstruction methods that take advantage of recent advances in machine learning. We propose a novel Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN) architecture featuring unique representations for diverse particle collision relationships and integrated graph pruning layers for scalability. Trained with a multi-task paradigm in an environment mimicking the LHCb experiment, this HGNN significantly improves beauty hadron reconstruction performance. Notably, it concurrently performs particle vertex association and graph pruning within a single framework. We quantify reconstruction and pruning performance, demonstrate enhanced inference time scaling with event complexity, and mitigate potential performance loss using a weighted message passing scheme.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables (revised for Machine Learning Science and Technology)</p></details> |
| **[Graph Neural Networks for Electricity Load Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03690v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting electricity demand is increasingly challenging as energy systems become more decentralized and intertwined with renewable sources. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm to model spatial dependencies in load data while accommodating complex non-stationarities. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework that integrates graph-based forecasting with attention mechanisms and ensemble aggregation strategies to enhance both predictive accuracy and interpretability. Several GNN architectures -- including Graph Convolutional Networks, GraphSAGE, APPNP, and Graph Attention Networks -- are systematically evaluated on synthetic, regional (France), and fine-grained (UK) datasets. Empirical results demonstrate that graph-aware models consistently outperform conventional baselines such as Feed Forward Neural Networks and foundation models like TiREX. Furthermore, attention layers provide valuable insights into evolving spatial interactions driven by meteorological and seasonal dynamics. Ensemble aggregation, particularly through bottom-up expert combination, further improves robustness under heterogeneous data conditions. Overall, the study highlights the complementarity between structural modeling, interpretability, and robustness, and discusses the trade-offs between accuracy, model complexity, and transparency in graph-based electricity load forecasting.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[Efficient Curvature-aware Graph Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01443v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph curvature provides geometric priors for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), enhancing their ability to model complex graph structures, particularly in terms of structural awareness, robustness, and theoretical interpretability. Among existing methods, Ollivier-Ricci curvature has been extensively studied due to its strong geometric interpretability, effectively characterizing the local geometric distribution between nodes. However, its prohibitively high computational complexity limits its applicability to large-scale graph datasets. To address this challenge, we propose a novel graph curvature measure--Effective Resistance Curvature--which quantifies the ease of message passing along graph edges using the effective resistance between node pairs, instead of the optimal transport distance. This method significantly outperforms Ollivier-Ricci curvature in computational efficiency while preserving comparable geometric expressiveness. Theoretically, we prove the low computational complexity of effective resistance curvature and establish its substitutability for Ollivier-Ricci curvature. Furthermore, extensive experiments on diverse GNN tasks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance with Ollivier-Ricci curvature while drastically reducing computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

While Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) provide high-quality socioeconomic data, their spatial coverage is limited and reported coordinates are randomly displaced for privacy, further reducing their quality. We propose a graph-based approach leveraging low-dimensional AlphaEarth satellite embeddings to predict cluster-level wealth indices across Sub-Saharan Africa. By modeling spatial relations between surveyed and unlabeled locations, and by introducing a probabilistic "fuzzy label" loss to account for coordinate displacement, we improve the generalization of wealth predictions beyond existing surveys. Our experiments on 37 DHS datasets (2017-2023) show that incorporating graph structure slightly improves accuracy compared to "image-only" baselines, demonstrating the potential of compact EO embeddings for large-scale socioeconomic mapping.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Based Solver for CNF Placement on the Cloud-Continuum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01343v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The placement of Cloud-Native Network Functions (CNFs) across the Cloud-Continuum represents a core challenge in the orchestration of current 5G and future 6G networks. The process involves the placement of interdependent computing tasks, structured as Service Function Chains, over distributed cloud infrastructures. This is achieved while satisfying strict resource, bandwidth and latency constraints. It is acknowledged that classical approaches, including mixed-integer nonlinear programming, heuristics and reinforcement learning are limited in terms of scalability, constraint handling and generalisation capacity. In the present study, a novel theoretical framework is proposed, which is based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) for CNF placement. The present approach proposes a reconceptualisation of placement as a generative graph to assignment task, where the placement problem is encoded as a heterogeneous graph, and a Graph Neural Network denoiser is trained to iteratively refine noisy CNF-to-cloud assignment matrices. The model incorporates constraint-specific losses directly into the loss function, thereby allowing it to learn feasible solution spaces. The integration of the DDPM formulation with structured combinatorial constraints is achieved through a rigorous and systematic approach. Extensive evaluations across diverse topologies have been conducted, which have confirmed that the model consistently produces feasible solutions with orders of magnitude faster inference than MINLP solvers. The results obtained demonstrate the potential of diffusion-based generative modelling for constrained network embedding problems, making an impact towards the practical, scalable orchestration of distributed Cloud-Native Network Functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Graph Neural Network-Based Semi-Supervised Open-Set Fault Diagnosis for Marine Machinery Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01258v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, fault diagnosis methods for marine machinery systems based on deep learning models have attracted considerable attention in the shipping industry. Most existing studies assume fault classes are consistent and known between the training and test datasets, and these methods perform well under controlled environment. In practice, however, previously unseen or unknown fault types (i.e., out-of-distribution or open-set observations not present during training) can occur, causing such methods to fail and posing a significant challenge to their widespread industrial deployment. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a semi-supervised open-set fault diagnosis (SOFD) framework that enhances and extends the applicability of deep learning models in open-set fault diagnosis scenarios. The framework includes a reliability subset construction process, which uses a multi-layer fusion feature representation extracted by a supervised feature learning model to select an unlabeled test subset. The labeled training set and pseudo-labeled test subset are then fed into a semi-supervised diagnosis model to learn discriminative features for each class, enabling accurate classification of known faults and effective detection of unknown samples. Experimental results on a public maritime benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SOFD framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[KAT-GNN: A Knowledge-Augmented Temporal Graph Neural Network for Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01249v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical risk prediction using electronic health records (EHRs) is vital to facilitate timely interventions and clinical decision support. However, modeling heterogeneous and irregular temporal EHR data presents significant challenges. We propose \textbf{KAT-GNN} (Knowledge-Augmented Temporal Graph Neural Network), a graph-based framework that integrates clinical knowledge and temporal dynamics for risk prediction. KAT-GNN first constructs modality-specific patient graphs from EHRs. These graphs are then augmented using two knowledge sources: (1) ontology-driven edges derived from SNOMED CT and (2) co-occurrence priors extracted from EHRs. Subsequently, a time-aware transformer is employed to capture longitudinal dynamics from the graph-encoded patient representations. KAT-GNN is evaluated on three distinct datasets and tasks: coronary artery disease (CAD) prediction using the Chang Gung Research Database (CGRD) and in-hospital mortality prediction using the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets. KAT-GNN achieves state-of-the-art performance in CAD prediction (AUROC: 0.9269 $\pm$ 0.0029) and demonstrated strong results in mortality prediction in MIMIC-III (AUROC: 0.9230 $\pm$ 0.0070) and MIMIC-IV (AUROC: 0.8849 $\pm$ 0.0089), consistently outperforming established baselines such as GRASP and RETAIN. Ablation studies confirm that both knowledge-based augmentation and the temporal modeling component are significant contributors to performance gains. These findings demonstrate that the integration of clinical knowledge into graph representations, coupled with a time-aware attention mechanism, provides an effective and generalizable approach for risk prediction across diverse clinical tasks and datasets.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Each LES case typically requires at least 24 hours of computation, making comprehensive parametric studies infeasible. We introduce WindMiL, a new machine learning framework that combines systematic dataset generation with symmetry-aware graph neural networks (GNNs). First, we introduce a large-scale dataset of wind loads on low-rise buildings by applying signed distance function interpolation to roof geometries and simulating 462 cases with LES across varying shapes and wind directions. Second, we develop a reflection-equivariant GNN that guarantees physically consistent predictions under mirrored geometries. Across interpolation and extrapolation evaluations, WindMiL achieves high accuracy for both the mean and the standard deviation of surface pressure coefficients (e.g., RMSE $\leq 0.02$ for mean $C_p$) and remains accurate under reflected-test evaluation, maintaining hit rates above $96\%$ where the non-equivariant baseline model drops by more than $10\%$. By pairing a systematic dataset with an equivariant surrogate, WindMiL enables efficient, scalable, and accurate predictions of wind loads on buildings.</p></details> |  |

Despite decades of research and numerous imputation methods, the literature remains fragmented across fields, creating a critical need for a comprehensive synthesis that connects statistical foundations with modern machine learning advances. This work systematically reviews core concepts-including missingness mechanisms, single versus multiple imputation, and different imputation goals-and examines problem characteristics across various domains. It provides a thorough categorization of imputation methods, spanning classical techniques (e.g., regression, the EM algorithm) to modern approaches like low-rank and high-rank matrix completion, deep learning models (autoencoders, GANs, diffusion models, graph neural networks), and large language models. Special attention is given to methods for complex data types, such as tensors, time series, streaming data, graph-structured data, categorical data, and multimodal data. Beyond methodology, we investigate the crucial integration of imputation with downstream tasks like classification, clustering, and anomaly detection, examining both sequential pipelines and joint optimization frameworks. The review also assesses theoretical guarantees, benchmarking resources, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we identify critical challenges and future directions, emphasizing model selection and hyperparameter optimization, the growing importance of privacy-preserving imputation via federated learning, and the pursuit of generalizable models that can adapt across domains and data types, thereby outlining a roadmap for future research.</p></details> |  |

However, recent theoretical advances have identified fundamental limitations in their information propagation capabilities, such as over-squashing, where distant nodes fail to effectively exchange information. While extensively studied in static contexts, this issue remains unexplored in Spatiotemporal GNNs (STGNNs), which process sequences associated with graph nodes. Nonetheless, the temporal dimension amplifies this challenge by increasing the information that must be propagated. In this work, we formalize the spatiotemporal over-squashing problem and demonstrate its distinct characteristics compared to the static case. Our analysis reveals that, counterintuitively, convolutional STGNNs favor information propagation from points temporally distant rather than close in time. Moreover, we prove that architectures that follow either time-and-space or time-then-space processing paradigms are equally affected by this phenomenon, providing theoretical justification for computationally efficient implementations. We validate our findings on synthetic and real-world datasets, providing deeper insights into their operational dynamics and principled guidance for more effective designs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Traditional retrieval methods are constrained by database coverage and quality. Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) enable direct location reasoning from image content, yet individual models struggle with diverse geographic regions and complex scenes. Existing multi-agent systems improve performance through model collaboration but treat all agent interactions uniformly. They lack mechanisms to handle conflicting predictions effectively. We propose \textbf{GraphGeo}, a multi-agent debate framework using heterogeneous graph neural networks for visual geo-localization. Our approach models diverse debate relationships through typed edges, distinguishing supportive collaboration, competitive argumentation, and knowledge transfer. We introduce a dual-level debate mechanism combining node-level refinement and edge-level argumentation modeling. A cross-level topology refinement strategy enables co-evolution between graph structure and agent representations. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate GraphGeo significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our framework transforms cognitive conflicts between agents into enhanced geo-localization accuracy through structured debate.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.</p></details> |  |

To support scalability, the bandwidth allocation policy is represented by a graph neural network (GNN), with which the number of training parameters does not change with the number of users. To enable the generalization of the GNN, we develop a hybrid-task meta-learning (HML) algorithm that trains the initial parameters of the GNN with different communication scenarios during meta-training. Next, during meta-testing, a few samples are used to fine-tune the GNN with unseen communication scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that our HML approach can improve the initial performance by 8.79%, and sample efficiency by 73%, compared with existing benchmarks. After fine-tuning, our near-optimal GNN-based policy can achieve close to the same reward with much lower inference complexity compared to the optimal policy obtained using iterative optimization. Numerical results validate that our HML can reduce the computation time by approximately 200 to 2000 times than the optimal iterative algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Repetition-Invariant Representations for Polymer Informatics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10726v2)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Polymers are large macromolecules composed of repeating structural units known as monomers and are widely applied in fields such as energy storage, construction, medicine, and aerospace. However, existing graph neural network methods, though effective for small molecules, only model the single unit of polymers and fail to produce consistent vector representations for the true polymer structure with varying numbers of units. To address this challenge, we introduce Graph Repetition Invariance (GRIN), a novel method to learn polymer representations that are invariant to the number of repeating units in their graph representations. GRIN integrates a graph-based maximum spanning tree alignment with repeat-unit augmentation to ensure structural consistency. We provide theoretical guarantees for repetition-invariance from both model and data perspectives, demonstrating that three repeating units are the minimal augmentation required for optimal invariant representation learning. GRIN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both homopolymer and copolymer benchmarks, learning stable, repetition-invariant representations that generalize effectively to polymer chains of unseen sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, current methods often overlook the critical importance of preserving symmetry when generating scene graphs from 3D point clouds, which can lead to reduced accuracy and robustness, particularly when dealing with noisy, multi-view data. Furthermore, a major limitation of prior approaches is the lack of temporal modeling to capture time-dependent relationships among dynamically evolving entities in a scene. To address these challenges, we propose Temporal Equivariant Scene Graph Neural Network (TESGNN), consisting of two key components: (1) an Equivariant Scene Graph Neural Network (ESGNN), which extracts information from 3D point clouds to generate scene graph while preserving crucial symmetry properties, and (2) a Temporal Graph Matching Network, which fuses scene graphs generated by ESGNN across multiple time sequences into a unified global representation using an approximate graph-matching algorithm. Our combined architecture TESGNN shown to be effective compared to existing methods in scene graph generation, achieving higher accuracy and faster training convergence. Moreover, we show that leveraging the symmetry-preserving property produces a more stable and accurate global scene representation compared to existing approaches. Finally, it is computationally efficient and easily implementable using existing frameworks, making it well-suited for real-time applications in robotics and computer vision. This approach paves the way for more robust and scalable solutions to complex multi-view scene understanding challenges.

Simple Architectures Meet Excellence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09263v3)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message-passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are often criticized for their limited expressiveness, issues like over-smoothing and over-squashing, and challenges in capturing long-range dependencies. Conversely, Graph Transformers (GTs) are regarded as superior due to their employment of global attention mechanisms, which potentially mitigate these challenges. Literature frequently suggests that GTs outperform GNNs in graph-level tasks, especially for graph classification and regression on small molecular graphs. In this study, we explore the untapped potential of GNNs through an enhanced framework, GNN+, which integrates six widely used techniques: edge feature integration, normalization, dropout, residual connections, feed-forward networks, and positional encoding, to effectively tackle graph-level tasks. We conduct a systematic re-evaluation of three classic GNNs (GCN, GIN, and GatedGCN) enhanced by the GNN+ framework across 14 well-known graph-level datasets. Our results reveal that, contrary to prevailing beliefs, these classic GNNs consistently match or surpass the performance of GTs, securing top-three rankings across all datasets and achieving first place in eight. Furthermore, they demonstrate greater efficiency, running several times faster than GTs on many datasets. This highlights the potential of simple GNN architectures, challenging the notion that complex mechanisms in GTs are essential for superior graph-level performance.

The problem is challenging in decentralized settings with robots that have limited communication and sensing capabilities. We propose a learnable Perception-Action-Communication (LPAC) architecture for the problem, wherein a convolutional neural network (CNN) processes localized perception; a graph neural network (GNN) facilitates robot communications; finally, a shallow multi-layer perceptron (MLP) computes robot actions. The GNN enables collaboration in the robot swarm by computing what information to communicate with nearby robots and how to incorporate received information. Evaluations show that the LPAC models -- trained using imitation learning -- outperform standard decentralized and centralized coverage control algorithms. The learned policy generalizes to environments different from the training dataset, transfers to larger environments with more robots, and is robust to noisy position estimates. The results indicate the suitability of LPAC architectures for decentralized navigation in robot swarms to achieve collaborative behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 Pa...</summary><p>20 Pages, 20 figures,</p></details> |
| **[Learning Sparse Approximate Inverse Preconditioners for Conjugate Gradient Solvers on GPUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27517v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The conjugate gradient solver (CG) is a prevalent method for solving symmetric and positive definite linear systems Ax=b, where effective preconditioners are crucial for fast convergence. Traditional preconditioners rely on prescribed algorithms to offer rigorous theoretical guarantees, while limiting their ability to exploit optimization from data. Existing learning-based methods often utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve the performance and speed up the construction. However, their reliance on incomplete factorization leads to significant challenges: the associated triangular solve hinders GPU parallelization in practice, and introduces long-range dependencies which are difficult for GNNs to model. To address these issues, we propose a learning-based method to generate GPU-friendly preconditioners, particularly using GNNs to construct Sparse Approximate Inverse (SPAI) preconditioners, which avoids triangular solves and requires only two matrix-vector products at each CG step. The locality of matrix-vector product is compatible with the local propagation mechanism of GNNs. The flexibility of GNNs also allows our approach to be applied in a wide range of scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a statistics-based scale-invariant loss function. Its design matches CG's property that the convergence rate depends on the condition number, rather than the absolute scale of A, leading to improved performance of the learned preconditioner. Evaluations on three PDE-derived datasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms standard preconditioners (Diagonal, IC, and traditional SPAI) and previous learning-based preconditioners on GPUs. We reduce solution time on GPUs by 40%-53% (68%-113% faster), along with better condition numbers and superior generalization performance.

While Graph Neural Networks, particularly Graph Convolutional Networks, have become standard tools for graph learning, they remain constrained by reliance on fixed structures and susceptibility to over-smoothing. We propose the Spectral Preservation Network, a new framework for graph representation learning that generates reduced graphs serving as faithful proxies of the original, enabling downstream tasks such as community detection, influence propagation, and information diffusion at a reduced computational cost. The Spectral Preservation Network introduces two key components: the Joint Graph Evolution layer and the Spectral Concordance loss. The former jointly transforms both the graph topology and the node feature matrix, allowing the structure and attributes to evolve adaptively across layers and overcoming the rigidity of static neighborhood aggregation. The latter regularizes these transformations by enforcing consistency in both the spectral properties of the graph and the feature vectors of the nodes. We evaluate the effectiveness of Spectral Preservation Network on node-level sparsification by analyzing well-established metrics and benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance and clear advantages of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometry-Aware Edge Pooling for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11700v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown significant success for graph-based tasks. Motivated by the prevalence of large datasets in real-world applications, pooling layers are crucial components of GNNs. By reducing the size of input graphs, pooling enables faster training and potentially better generalisation. However, existing pooling operations often optimise for the learning task at the expense of discarding fundamental graph structures, thus reducing interpretability. This leads to unreliable performance across dataset types, downstream tasks and pooling ratios. Addressing these concerns, we propose novel graph pooling layers for structure-aware pooling via edge collapses. Our methods leverage diffusion geometry and iteratively reduce a graph's size while preserving both its metric structure and its structural diversity. We guide pooling using magnitude, an isometry-invariant diversity measure, which permits us to control the fidelity of the pooling process. Further, we use the spread of a metric space as a faster and more stable alternative ensuring computational efficiency.

| **[Multi-Modal Feature Fusion for Spatial Morphology Analysis of Traditional Villages via Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27208v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Villages areas hold significant importance in the study of human-land relationships. However, with the advancement of urbanization, the gradual disappearance of spatial characteristics and the homogenization of landscapes have emerged as prominent issues. Existing studies primarily adopt a single-disciplinary perspective to analyze villages spatial morphology and its influencing factors, relying heavily on qualitative analysis methods. These efforts are often constrained by the lack of digital infrastructure and insufficient data. To address the current research limitations, this paper proposes a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model that integrates multi-source data to conduct an in-depth analysis of villages spatial morphology. The framework includes two types of nodes-input nodes and communication nodes-and two types of edges-static input edges and dynamic communication edges. By combining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT), the proposed model efficiently integrates multimodal features under a two-stage feature update mechanism. Additionally, based on existing principles for classifying villages spatial morphology, the paper introduces a relational pooling mechanism and implements a joint training strategy across 17 subtypes. Experimental results demonstrate that this method achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches in multimodal fusion and classification tasks. Additionally, the proposed joint optimization of all sub-types lifts mean accuracy/F1 from 0.71/0.83 (independent models) to 0.82/0.90, driven by a 6% gain for parcel tasks. Our method provides scientific evidence for exploring villages spatial patterns and generative logic.</p></details> |  |

Traditional accident prediction models treat road segments independently, failing to capture complex spatial relationships and temporal dependencies in urban transportation networks. This study develops MDAS-GNN, a Multi-Dimensional Attention-based Spatial-diffusion Graph Neural Network integrating three core risk dimensions: traffic safety, infrastructure, and environmental risk. The framework employs feature-specific spatial diffusion mechanisms and multi-head temporal attention to capture dependencies across different time horizons. Evaluated on UK Department for Transport accident data across Central London, South Manchester, and SE Birmingham, MDASGNN achieves superior performance compared to established baseline methods. The model maintains consistently low prediction errors across short, medium, and long-term periods, with particular strength in long-term forecasting. Ablation studies confirm that integrated multi-dimensional features outperform singlefeature approaches, reducing prediction errors by up to 40%. This framework provides civil engineers and urban planners with advanced predictive capabilities for transportation infrastructure design, enabling data-driven decisions for road network optimization, infrastructure resource improvements, and strategic safety interventions in urban development projects.</p></details> |  |
| **[MeixnerNet: Adaptive and Robust Spectral Graph Neural Networks with Discrete Orthogonal Polynomials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00113v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results by defining graph convolutions in the spectral domain. A common approach, popularized by ChebyNet, is to use polynomial filters based on continuous orthogonal polynomials (e.g., Chebyshev). This creates a theoretical disconnect, as these continuous-domain filters are applied to inherently discrete graph structures. We hypothesize this mismatch can lead to suboptimal performance and fragility to hyperparameter settings. In this paper, we introduce MeixnerNet, a novel spectral GNN architecture that employs discrete orthogonal polynomials -- specifically, the Meixner polynomials $M_k(x; \beta, c)$. Our model makes the two key shape parameters of the polynomial, beta and c, learnable, allowing the filter to adapt its polynomial basis to the specific spectral properties of a given graph. We overcome the significant numerical instability of these polynomials by introducing a novel stabilization technique that combines Laplacian scaling with per-basis LayerNorm. We demonstrate experimentally that MeixnerNet achieves competitive-to-superior performance against the strong ChebyNet baseline at the optimal K = 2 setting (winning on 2 out of 3 benchmarks). More critically, we show that MeixnerNet is exceptionally robust to variations in the polynomial degree K, a hyperparameter to which ChebyNet proves to be highly fragile, collapsing in performance where MeixnerNet remains stable.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Cloud-Based Spatio-Temporal GNN-Transformer Hybrid Model for Traffic Flow Forecasting with External Feature Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27039v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate traffic flow forecasting is essential for the development of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), supporting tasks such as traffic signal optimization, congestion management, and route planning. Traditional models often fail to effectively capture complex spatial-temporal dependencies in large-scale road networks, especially under the influence of external factors such as weather, holidays, and traffic accidents. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a cloud-based hybrid model that integrates Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNN) with a Transformer architecture for traffic flow prediction. The model leverages the strengths of GNNs in modeling spatial correlations across road networks and the Transformers' ability to capture long-term temporal dependencies. External contextual features are incorporated via feature fusion to enhance predictive accuracy. The proposed model is deployed on a cloud computing platform to achieve scalability and real-time adaptability. Experimental evaluation of the dataset shows that our model outperforms baseline methods (LSTM, TCN, GCN, pure Transformer) with an RMSE of only 17.92 and a MAE of only 10.53. These findings suggest that the hybrid GNN-Transformer approach provides an effective and scalable solution for cloud-based ITS applications, offering methodological advancements for traffic flow forecasting and practical implications for congestion mitigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Semi-Supervised Learning for Point Classification on Data Manifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12197v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a graph semi-supervised learning framework for classification tasks on data manifolds. Motivated by the manifold hypothesis, we model data as points sampled from a low-dimensional manifold $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathbb{R}^F$. The manifold is approximated in an unsupervised manner using a variational autoencoder (VAE), where the trained encoder maps data to embeddings that represent their coordinates in $\mathbb{R}^F$. A geometric graph is constructed with Gaussian-weighted edges inversely proportional to distances in the embedding space, transforming the point classification problem into a semi-supervised node classification task on the graph. This task is solved using a graph neural network (GNN). Our main contribution is a theoretical analysis of the statistical generalization properties of this data-to-manifold-to-graph pipeline. We show that, under uniform sampling from $\mathcal{M}$, the generalization gap of the semi-supervised task diminishes with increasing graph size, up to the GNN training error. Leveraging a training procedure which resamples a slightly larger graph at regular intervals during training, we then show that the generalization gap can be reduced even further, vanishing asymptotically. Finally, we validate our findings with numerical experiments on image classification benchmarks, demonstrating the empirical effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |

Existing methods to model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability across different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships directly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based hierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy inference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies through graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction approach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show that our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases, and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable, data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks.

Besides working well in practical settings, their ability to generalize beyond the training set remains poorly understood. While some studies have explored MPNNs' generalization in graph-level prediction tasks, much less attention has been given to node- and link-level predictions. Existing works often rely on unrealistic i.i.d.\@ assumptions, overlooking possible correlations between nodes or links, and assuming fixed aggregation and impractical loss functions while neglecting the influence of graph structure. In this work, we introduce a unified framework to analyze the generalization properties of MPNNs in inductive and transductive node and link prediction settings, incorporating diverse architectural parameters and loss functions and quantifying the influence of graph structure. Additionally, our proposed generalization framework can be applied beyond graphs to any classification task under the inductive or transductive setting. Our empirical study supports our theoretical insights, deepening our understanding of MPNNs' generalization capabilities in these tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2412.07106</p></details> |
| **[UnifiedFL: A Dynamic Unified Learning Framework for Equitable Federation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26350v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative model training across multiple clients without sharing raw data, enabling privacy-preserving applications in areas such as radiology and pathology. However, works on collaborative training across clients with fundamentally different neural architectures and non-identically distributed datasets remain scarce. Existing FL frameworks face several limitations. Despite claiming to support architectural heterogeneity, most recent FL methods only tolerate variants within a single model family (e.g., shallower, deeper, or wider CNNs), still presuming a shared global architecture and failing to accommodate federations where clients deploy fundamentally different network types (e.g., CNNs, GNNs, MLPs). Moreover, existing approaches often address only statistical heterogeneity while overlooking the domain-fracture problem, where each client's data distribution differs markedly from that faced at testing time, undermining model generalizability. When clients use different architectures, have non-identically distributed data, and encounter distinct test domains, current methods perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose UnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous local networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a shared graph neural network (GNN). UnifiedFL introduces (i) a common GNN to parameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean distances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy balancing convergence and diversity. Experiments on MedMNIST classification and hippocampus segmentation benchmarks demonstrate UnifiedFL's superior performance. Code and data: https://github.com/basiralab/UnifiedFL</p></details> |  |
| **[From Embedding to Control: Representations for Stochastic Multi-Object Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26344v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies how to achieve accurate modeling and effective control in stochastic nonlinear dynamics with multiple interacting objects. However, non-uniform interactions and random topologies make this task challenging. We address these challenges by proposing \textit{Graph Controllable Embeddings} (GCE), a general framework to learn stochastic multi-object dynamics for linear control. Specifically, GCE is built on Hilbert space embeddings, allowing direct embedding of probability distributions of controlled stochastic dynamics into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), which enables linear operations in its RKHS while retaining nonlinear expressiveness. We provide theoretical guarantees on the existence, convergence, and applicability of GCE. Notably, a mean field approximation technique is adopted to efficiently capture inter-object dependencies and achieve provably low sample complexity. By integrating graph neural networks, we construct data-dependent kernel features that are capable of adapting to dynamic interaction patterns and generalizing to even unseen topologies with only limited training instances. GCE scales seamlessly to multi-object systems of varying sizes and topologies. Leveraging the linearity of Hilbert spaces, GCE also supports simple yet effective control algorithms for synthesizing optimal sequences. Experiments on physical systems, robotics, and power grids validate GCE and demonstrate consistent performance improvement over various competitive embedding methods in both in-distribution and few-shot tests</p></details> |  |

Graph-based approaches have become increasingly important for modeling entity interactions, yet most rely on homogeneous and static structures, which limits their ability to capture the heterogeneity and temporal evolution of real-world environments. Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for anomaly detection by incorporating type-aware transformations and relation-sensitive aggregation, enabling more expressive modeling of complex cyber data. However, current research on HGNN-based anomaly detection remains fragmented, with diverse modeling strategies, limited comparative evaluation, and an absence of standardized benchmarks. To address this gap, we provide a comprehensive survey of HGNN-based anomaly detection methods in cybersecurity. We introduce a taxonomy that classifies approaches by anomaly type and graph dynamics, analyze representative models, and map them to key cybersecurity applications. We also review commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, highlighting their strengths and limitations. Finally, we identify key open challenges related to modeling, data, and deployment, and outline promising directions for future research. This survey aims to establish a structured foundation for advancing HGNN-based anomaly detection toward scalable, interpretable, and practically deployable solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 4 figures, 86 references.

| **[Morphology-Aware Graph Reinforcement Learning for Tensegrity Robot Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26067v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensegrity robots combine rigid rods and elastic cables, offering high resilience and deployability but posing major challenges for locomotion control due to their underactuated and highly coupled dynamics. This paper introduces a morphology-aware reinforcement learning framework that integrates a graph neural network (GNN) into the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. By representing the robot's physical topology as a graph, the proposed GNN-based policy captures coupling among components, enabling faster and more stable learning than conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) policies. The method is validated on a physical 3-bar tensegrity robot across three locomotion primitives, including straight-line tracking and bidirectional turning. It shows superior sample efficiency, robustness to noise and stiffness variations, and improved trajectory accuracy. Notably, the learned policies transfer directly from simulation to hardware without fine-tuning, achieving stable real-world locomotion. These results demonstrate the advantages of incorporating structural priors into reinforcement learning for tensegrity robot control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-driven Projection Generation for Efficiently Solving Heterogeneous Quadratic Programming Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26061v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a data-driven framework for efficiently solving quadratic programming (QP) problems by reducing the number of variables in high-dimensional QPs using instance-specific projection. A graph neural network-based model is designed to generate projections tailored to each QP instance, enabling us to produce high-quality solutions even for previously unseen problems. The model is trained on heterogeneous QPs to minimize the expected objective value evaluated on the projected solutions. This is formulated as a bilevel optimization problem; the inner optimization solves the QP under a given projection using a QP solver, while the outer optimization updates the model parameters. We develop an efficient algorithm to solve this bilevel optimization problem, which computes parameter gradients without backpropagating through the solver. We provide a theoretical analysis of the generalization ability of solving QPs with projection matrices generated by neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces high-quality feasible solutions with reduced computation time, outperforming existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Graph Networks for Accurate Weather Forecasting via Lightweight Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22094v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Climate events arise from intricate, multivariate dynamics governed by global-scale drivers, profoundly impacting food, energy, and infrastructure. Yet, accurate weather prediction remains elusive due to physical processes unfolding across diverse spatio-temporal scales, which fixed-resolution methods cannot capture. Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) offer a multiscale representation, but nonlinear downward mappings often erase global trends, weakening the integration of physics into forecasts. We introduce HiFlowCast and its ensemble variant HiAntFlow, HGNNs that embed physics within a multiscale prediction framework. Two innovations underpin their design: a Latent-Memory-Retention mechanism that preserves global trends during downward traversal, and a Latent-to-Physics branch that integrates PDE solution fields across diverse scales. Our Flow models cut errors by over 5% at 13-day lead times and by 5-8% under 1st and 99th quantile extremes, improving reliability for rare events. Leveraging pretrained model weights, they converge within a single epoch, reducing training cost and their carbon footprint. Such efficiency is vital as the growing scale of machine learning challenges sustainability and limits research accessibility. Code and model weights are in the supplementary materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fixed-point graph convolutional networks against adversarial attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00083v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks present a significant risk to the integrity and performance of graph neural networks, particularly in tasks where graph structure and node features are vulnerable to manipulation. In this paper, we present a novel model, called fixed-point iterative graph convolutional network (Fix-GCN), which achieves robustness against adversarial perturbations by effectively capturing higher-order node neighborhood information in the graph without additional memory or computational complexity. Specifically, we introduce a versatile spectral modulation filter and derive the feature propagation rule of our model using fixed-point iteration. Unlike traditional defense mechanisms that rely on additional design elements to counteract attacks, the proposed graph filter provides a flexible-pass filtering approach, allowing it to selectively attenuate high-frequency components while preserving low-frequency structural information in the graph signal. By iteratively updating node representations, our model offers a flexible and efficient framework for preserving essential graph information while mitigating the impact of adversarial manipulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model through extensive experiments on various benchmark graph datasets, showcasing its resilience against adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |

We present InvGNN-WM, which ties ownership to a model's implicit perception of a graph invariant, enabling trigger-free, black-box verification with negligible task impact. A lightweight head predicts normalized algebraic connectivity on an owner-private carrier set; a sign-sensitive decoder outputs bits, and a calibrated threshold controls the false-positive rate. Across diverse node and graph classification datasets and backbones, InvGNN-WM matches clean accuracy while yielding higher watermark accuracy than trigger- and compression-based baselines. It remains strong under unstructured pruning, fine-tuning, and post-training quantization; plain knowledge distillation (KD) weakens the mark, while KD with a watermark loss (KD+WM) restores it. We provide guarantees for imperceptibility and robustness, and we prove that exact removal is NP-complete.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Network-based Structural Simulator: Graph Neural Networks for Structural Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25683v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been explored as surrogate models for numerical simulations. While their applications in computational fluid dynamics have been investigated, little attention has been given to structural problems, especially for dynamic cases. To address this gap, we introduce the Graph Network-based Structural Simulator (GNSS), a GNN framework for surrogate modeling of dynamic structural problems. GNSS follows the encode-process-decode paradigm typical of GNN-based machine learning models, and its design makes it particularly suited for dynamic simulations thanks to three key features: (i) expressing node kinematics in node-fixed local frames, which avoids catastrophic cancellation in finite-difference velocities; (ii) employing a sign-aware regression loss, which reduces phase errors in long rollouts; and (iii) using a wavelength-informed connectivity radius, which optimizes graph construction. We evaluate GNSS on a case study involving a beam excited by a 50kHz Hanning-modulated pulse. The results show that GNSS accurately reproduces the physics of the problem over hundreds of timesteps and generalizes to unseen loading conditions, where existing GNNs fail to converge or deliver meaningful predictions. Compared with explicit finite element baselines, GNSS achieves substantial inference speedups while preserving spatial and temporal fidelity. These findings demonstrate that locality-preserving GNNs with physics-consistent update rules are a competitive alternative for dynamic, wave-dominated structural simulations.</p></details> | 16 pages, 14 figures |

However, the decision-making process of GNNs remains opaque to the end user, which undermines their use in safety-critical applications. Several explainable AI techniques for graphs have been developed to address this major issue. Focusing on graph classification, these explainers identify subgraph motifs that explain predictions. Therefore, a robust benchmarking of graph explainers is required to ensure that the produced explanations are of high quality, i.e., aligned with the GNN's decision process. However, current graph-XAI benchmarks are limited to simplistic synthetic datasets or a few real-world tasks curated by domain experts, hindering rigorous and reproducible evaluation, and consequently stalling progress in the field. To overcome these limitations, we propose a method to automate the construction of graph XAI benchmarks from generic graph classification datasets. Our approach leverages the Weisfeiler-Leman color refinement algorithm to efficiently perform approximate subgraph matching and mine class-discriminating motifs, which serve as proxy ground-truth class explanations. At the same time, we ensure that these motifs can be learned by GNNs because their discriminating power aligns with WL expressiveness. This work also introduces the OpenGraphXAI benchmark suite, which consists of 15 ready-made graph-XAI datasets derived by applying our method to real-world molecular classification datasets. The suite is available to the public along with a codebase to generate over 2,000 additional graph-XAI benchmarks. Finally, we present a use case that illustrates how the suite can be used to assess the effectiveness of a selection of popular graph explainers, demonstrating the critical role of a sufficiently large benchmark collection for improving the significance of experimental results.</p></details> |  |

The development of adaptive and differentiable software pipelines using a combination of conventional and machine learning algorithms is therefore getting ever more important to optimize and operate the system efficiently while maintaining end-to-end (E2E) differentiability. We propose for the application of charged particle tracking an E2E differentiable decision-focused learning scheme using graph neural networks with combinatorial components solving a linear assignment problem for each detector layer. We demonstrate empirically that including differentiable variations of discrete assignment operations allows for efficient network optimization, working better or on par with approaches that lack E2E differentiability. In additional studies, we dive deeper into the optimization process and provide further insights from a loss landscape perspective. We demonstrate that while both methods converge into similar performing, globally well-connected regions, they suffer under substantial predictive instability across initialization and optimization methods, which can have unpredictable consequences on the performance of downstream tasks such as image reconstruction. We also point out a dependency between the interpolation factor of the gradient estimator and the prediction stability of the model, suggesting the choice of sufficiently small values. Given the strong global connectivity of learned solutions and the excellent training performance, we argue that E2E differentiability provides, besides the general availability of gradient information, an important tool for robust particle tracking to mitigate prediction instabilities by favoring solutions that perform well on downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR), 2025</p></details> |

While local explanations offer insights into individual predictions, global explanation methods, those that characterize an entire class, remain underdeveloped. Existing global explainers rely on motif discovery in small graphs, an approach that breaks down in large, real-world settings where subgraph repetition is rare, node attributes are high-dimensional, and predictions arise from complex structure-attribute interactions. We propose GnnXemplar, a novel global explainer inspired from Exemplar Theory from cognitive science. GnnXemplar identifies representative nodes in the GNN embedding space, exemplars, and explains predictions using natural language rules derived from their neighborhoods. Exemplar selection is framed as a coverage maximization problem over reverse k-nearest neighbors, for which we provide an efficient greedy approximation. To derive interpretable rules, we employ a self-refining prompt strategy using large language models (LLMs). Experiments across diverse benchmarks show that GnnXemplar significantly outperforms existing methods in fidelity, scalability, and human interpretability, as validated by a user study with 60 participants.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 20 figures, NeurIPS 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

Most existing approaches often require long training times, large-capacity models, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. We introduce FastJAM, a rapid, graph-based method that drastically reduces the computational complexity of joint alignment tasks. FastJAM leverages pairwise matches computed by an off-the-shelf image matcher, together with a rapid nonparametric clustering, to construct a graph representing intra- and inter-image keypoint relations. A graph neural network propagates and aggregates these correspondences, efficiently predicting per-image homography parameters via image-level pooling. Utilizing an inverse-compositional loss, that eliminates the need for a regularization term over the predicted transformations (and thus also obviates the hyperparameter tuning associated with such terms), FastJAM performs image JA quickly and effectively. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that FastJAM achieves results better than existing modern JA methods in terms of alignment quality, while reducing computation time from hours or minutes to mere seconds.

Although spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved success in modeling various static spatio-temporal forecasting scenarios, real-world spatio-temporal data are typically received in a streaming manner, and the network continuously expands with the installation of new sensors. Thus, spatio-temporal forecasting in streaming scenarios faces dual challenges: the inefficiency of retraining models over newly arrived data and the detrimental effects of catastrophic forgetting over long-term history. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prompt tuning-based continuous forecasting method, following two fundamental tuning principles guided by empirical and theoretical analysis: expand and compress, which effectively resolve the aforementioned problems with lightweight tuning parameters. Specifically, we integrate the base spatio-temporal graph neural network with a continuous prompt pool, utilizing stored prompts (i.e., few learnable parameters) in memory, and jointly optimize them with the base spatio-temporal graph neural network. This method ensures that the model sequentially learns from the spatio-temporal data stream to accomplish tasks for corresponding periods. Extensive experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the multi-faceted superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art baselines, including effectiveness, efficiency, universality, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods like low-rank adaptations (LoRA) are efficient but lack flexibility, while Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) enhance model capacity at the cost of more & under-utilized parameters. To address these limitations, we propose Structural Mixture of Residual Experts (S'MoRE), a novel framework that seamlessly integrates the efficiency of LoRA with the flexibility of MoE. Conceptually, S'MoRE employs hierarchical low-rank decomposition of expert weights, yielding residuals of varying orders interconnected in a multi-layer structure. By routing input tokens through sub-trees of residuals, S'MoRE emulates the capacity of numerous experts by instantiating and assembling just a few low-rank matrices. We craft the inter-layer propagation of S'MoRE's residuals as a special type of Graph Neural Network (GNN), and prove that under similar parameter budget, S'MoRE improves structural flexibility of traditional MoE (or Mixture-of-LoRA) by exponential order. Comprehensive theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that S'MoRE achieves superior fine-tuning performance, offering a transformative approach for efficient LLM adaptation.

Many real-world graphs exceed the memory capacity of a GPU due to their sheer size, and training GNNs on such graphs requires techniques such as mini-batch sampling to scale. The alternative approach of distributed full-graph training suffers from high communication overheads and load imbalance due to the irregular structure of graphs. We propose a three-dimensional (3D) parallel approach for full-graph training that tackles these issues and scales to billion-edge graphs. In addition, we introduce optimizations such as a double permutation scheme for load balancing, and a performance model to predict the optimal 3D configuration of our parallel implementation -- Plexus. We evaluate Plexus on six different graph datasets and show scaling results on up to 2048 GPUs of Perlmutter, and 1024 GPUs of Frontier. Plexus achieves unprecedented speedups of 2.3-12.5x over prior state of the art, and a reduction in time-to-solution by 5.2-8.7x on Perlmutter and 7.0-54.2x on Frontier.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention Augmented GNN RNN-Attention Models for Advanced Cybersecurity Intrusion Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25802v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning architecture that synergistically combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and multi-head attention mechanisms to significantly enhance cybersecurity intrusion detection capabilities. By leveraging the comprehensive UNSW-NB15 dataset containing diverse network traffic patterns, our approach effectively captures both spatial dependencies through graph structural relationships and temporal dynamics through sequential analysis of network events. The integrated attention mechanism provides dual benefits of improved model interpretability and enhanced feature selection, enabling cybersecurity analysts to focus computational resources on high-impact security events -- a critical requirement in modern real-time intrusion detection systems. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed hybrid model achieves superior performance compared to traditional machine learning approaches and standalone deep learning models across multiple evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model achieves particularly strong performance in detecting sophisticated attack patterns such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, and zero-day exploits, making it a promising solution for next-generation cybersecurity applications in complex network environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Fair Graph Representations with Multi-view Information Bottleneck](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25096v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel on relational data by passing messages over node features and structure, but they can amplify training data biases, propagating discriminatory attributes and structural imbalances into unfair outcomes. Many fairness methods treat bias as a single source, ignoring distinct attribute and structure effects and leading to suboptimal fairness and utility trade-offs. To overcome this challenge, we propose FairMIB, a multi-view information bottleneck framework designed to decompose graphs into feature, structural, and diffusion views for mitigating complexity biases in GNNs. Especially, the proposed FairMIB employs contrastive learning to maximize cross-view mutual information for bias-free representation learning. It further integrates multi-perspective conditional information bottleneck objectives to balance task utility and fairness by minimizing mutual information with sensitive attributes. Additionally, FairMIB introduces an inverse probability-weighted (IPW) adjacency correction in the diffusion view, which reduces the spread of bias propagation during message passing. Experiments on five real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairMIB achieves state-of-the-art performance across both utility and fairness metrics.</p></details> |  |

This work presents a novel approach toward high-energy molecules by combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for molecular generation and Attentive Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for property predictions. We propose a transformative embedding space construction strategy that integrates fixed SHA-256 embeddings with partially trainable representations. Unlike conventional regularization techniques, this changes the representational basis itself, reshaping the molecular input space before learning begins. Without recourse to pretraining, the generator achieves 67.5% validity and 37.5% novelty. The generated library exhibits a mean Tanimoto coefficient of 0.214 relative to training set signifying the ability of framework to generate a diverse chemical space. We identified 37 new super explosives higher than 9 km/s predicted detonation velocity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Network Assisted Genetic Algorithm for Structural Dynamic Response and Parameter Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22839v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The optimization of structural parameters, such as mass(m), stiffness(k), and damping coefficient(c), is critical for designing efficient, resilient, and stable structures. Conventional numerical approaches, including Finite Element Method (FEM) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, provide high-fidelity results but are computationally expensive for iterative optimization tasks, as each evaluation requires solving the governing equations for every parameter combination. This study proposes a hybrid data-driven framework that integrates a Graph Neural Network (GNN) surrogate model with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimizer to overcome these challenges. The GNN is trained to accurately learn the nonlinear mapping between structural parameters and dynamic displacement responses, enabling rapid predictions without repeatedly solving the system equations. A dataset of single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system responses is generated using the Newmark Beta method across diverse mass, stiffness, and damping configurations. The GA then searches for globally optimal parameter sets by minimizing predicted displacements and enhancing dynamic stability. Results demonstrate that the GNN and GA framework achieves strong convergence, robust generalization, and significantly reduced computational cost compared to conventional simulations. This approach highlights the effectiveness of combining machine learning surrogates with evolutionary optimization for automated and intelligent structural design.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |

In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised learning framework that leverages spatio-temporal structures to improve multi-variable weather prediction. The model integrates a graph neural network (GNN) for spatial reasoning, a self-supervised pretraining scheme for representation learning, and a spatio-temporal adaptation mechanism to enhance generalization across varying forecasting horizons. Extensive experiments on both ERA5 and MERRA-2 reanalysis datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and recent deep learning methods. Quantitative evaluations and visual analyses in Beijing and Shanghai confirm the model's capability to capture fine-grained meteorological patterns. The proposed framework provides a scalable and label-efficient solution for future data-driven weather forecasting systems.</p></details> |  |

Although Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are widely used for financial fraud detection, graph Transformer models such as Graph-BERT are gaining prominence due to their Transformer-based architecture, which mitigates issues such as over-smoothing. Graph-BERT is designed for static graphs and primarily evaluated on citation networks with undirected edges. However, financial transaction networks are inherently dynamic, with evolving structures and directed edges representing the flow of money. To address these challenges, we introduce DynBERG, a novel architecture that integrates Graph-BERT with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layer to capture temporal evolution over multiple time steps. Additionally, we modify the underlying algorithm to support directed edges, making DynBERG well-suited for dynamic financial transaction analysis. We evaluate our model on the Elliptic dataset, which includes Bitcoin transactions, including all transactions during a major cryptocurrency market event, the Dark Market Shutdown. By assessing DynBERG's resilience before and after this event, we analyse its ability to adapt to significant market shifts that impact transaction behaviours. Our model is benchmarked against state-of-the-art dynamic graph classification approaches, such as EvolveGCN and GCN, demonstrating superior performance, outperforming EvolveGCN before the market shutdown and surpassing GCN after the event. Additionally, an ablation study highlights the critical role of incorporating a time-series deep learning component, showcasing the effectiveness of GRU in modelling the temporal dynamics of financial transactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAGNET: A Multi-Graph Attentional Network for Code Clone Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24241v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code clone detection is a fundamental task in software engineering that underpins refactoring, debugging, plagiarism detection, and vulnerability analysis. Existing methods often rely on singular representations such as abstract syntax trees (ASTs), control flow graphs (CFGs), and data flow graphs (DFGs), which capture only partial aspects of code semantics. Hybrid approaches have emerged, but their fusion strategies are typically handcrafted and ineffective. In this study, we propose MAGNET, a multi-graph attentional framework that jointly leverages AST, CFG, and DFG representations to capture syntactic and semantic features of source code. MAGNET integrates residual graph neural networks with node-level self-attention to learn both local and long-range dependencies, introduces a gated cross-attention mechanism for fine-grained inter-graph interactions, and employs Set2Set pooling to fuse multi-graph embeddings into unified program-level representations. Extensive experiments on BigCloneBench and Google Code Jam demonstrate that MAGNET achieves state-of-the-art performance with an overall F1 score of 96.5\% and 99.2\% on the two datasets, respectively. Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of multi-graph fusion and each attentional component. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZixianReid/Multigraph_match</p></details> |  |
| **[The Logical Expressiveness of Temporal GNNs via Two-Dimensional Product Logics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11930v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the expressive power of various neural architectures -- including graph neural networks (GNNs), transformers, and recurrent neural networks -- has been characterised using tools from logic and formal language theory. As the capabilities of basic architectures are becoming well understood, increasing attention is turning to models that combine multiple architectural paradigms. Among them particularly important, and challenging to analyse, are temporal extensions of GNNs, which integrate both spatial (graph-structure) and temporal (evolution over time) dimensions. In this paper, we initiate the study of logical characterisation of temporal GNNs by connecting them to two-dimensional product logics. We show that the expressive power of temporal GNNs depends on how graph and temporal components are combined. In particular, temporal GNNs that apply static GNNs recursively over time can capture all properties definable in the product logic of (past) propositional temporal logic PTL and the modal logic K. In contrast, architectures such as graph-and-time TGNNs and global TGNNs can only express restricted fragments of this logic, where the interaction between temporal and spatial operators is syntactically constrained. These provide us with the first results on the logical expressiveness of temporal GNNs.</p></details> |  |

As a UNESCO-recognized intangible cultural heritage, Nanyin follows a heterophonic tradition centered around the pipa, where core melodies are notated in traditional notation while ornamentations are passed down orally, presenting challenges for both preservation and contemporary innovation. To address this, we construct a Pipa-Centric MIDI dataset, develop NanyinTok as a specialized tokenization method, and convert symbolic sequences into graph structures using a Graph Converter to ensure that key musical features are preserved. Our key innovation reformulates ornamentation generation as the creation of ornamentation nodes within a heterogeneous graph. First, a graph neural network generates melodic outlines optimized for ornamentations. Then, a rule-guided system informed by Nanyin performance practices refines these outlines into complete ornamentations without requiring explicit ornamentation annotations during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our model successfully generates authentic heterophonic ensembles featuring four traditional instruments. These findings validate that integrating domain-specific knowledge into model architecture can effectively mitigate data scarcity challenges in computational ethnomusicology.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Rademacher Meets Colors: More Expressivity, but at What Cost ?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10101v3)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) is typically understood through their correspondence with graph isomorphism tests such as the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. While more expressive GNNs can distinguish a richer set of graphs, they are also observed to suffer from higher generalization error. This work provides a theoretical explanation for this trade-off by linking expressivity and generalization through the lens of coloring algorithms. Specifically, we show that the number of equivalence classes induced by WL colorings directly bounds the GNNs Rademacher complexity -- a key data-dependent measure of generalization. Our analysis reveals that greater expressivity leads to higher complexity and thus weaker generalization guarantees. Furthermore, we prove that the Rademacher complexity is stable under perturbations in the color counts across different samples, ensuring robustness to sampling variability across datasets. Importantly, our framework is not restricted to message-passing GNNs or 1-WL, but extends to arbitrary GNN architectures and expressivity measures that partition graphs into equivalence classes. These results unify the study of expressivity and generalization in GNNs, providing a principled understanding of why increasing expressive power often comes at the cost of generalization.</p></details> |  |

For prediction accuracy \hdgc outperforms major and popular graph neural network implementations as well as state-of-the-art hyperdimensional computing implementations for a collection of homophilic graphs and heterophilic graphs. Compared with the most accurate learning methodologies we have tested, on the same target GPU platform, \hdgc is on average 9561.0 and 144.5 times faster than \gcnii, a graph neural network implementation and HDGL, a hyperdimensional computing implementation, respectively. As the majority of the learning operates on binary vectors, we expect outstanding energy performance of \hdgc on neuromorphic and emerging process-in-memory devices.</p></details> |  |

We introduce FALCON, a unified machine learning framework that enables fully automated, specification-driven analog circuit synthesis through topology selection and layout-constrained optimization. Given a target performance, FALCON first selects an appropriate circuit topology using a performance-driven classifier guided by human design heuristics. Next, it employs a custom, edge-centric graph neural network trained to map circuit topology and parameters to performance, enabling gradient-based parameter inference through the learned forward model. This inference is guided by a differentiable layout cost, derived from analytical equations capturing parasitic and frequency-dependent effects, and constrained by design rules. We train and evaluate FALCON on a large-scale custom dataset of 1M analog mm-wave circuits, generated and simulated using Cadence Spectre across 20 expert-designed topologies. Through this evaluation, FALCON demonstrates >99% accuracy in topology inference, <10% relative error in performance prediction, and efficient layout-aware design that completes in under 1 second per instance. Together, these results position FALCON as a practical and extensible foundation model for end-to-end analog circuit design automation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

Building on the Bayesian decision-theoretic framework of Sablayrolles et al., we derive the Bayes-optimal membership inference rule for node-level MIAs against graph neural networks, addressing key open questions about optimal query strategies in the graph setting. We introduce BASE and G-BASE, tractable approximations of the Bayes-optimal membership inference. G-BASE achieves superior performance compared to previously proposed classifier-based node-level MIA attacks. BASE, which is also applicable to non-graph data, matches or exceeds the performance of prior state-of-the-art MIAs, such as LiRA and RMIA, at a significantly lower computational cost. Finally, we show that BASE and RMIA are equivalent under a specific hyperparameter setting, providing a principled, Bayes-optimal justification for the RMIA attack.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Ne...</summary><p>In NeurIPS 2025, 10 pages plus 15 pages of appendices</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Graph Neural Networks: A Mutual Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19223v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge distillation (KD) techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for transferring expertise from complex teacher models to lightweight student models, particularly beneficial for deploying high-performance models in resource-constrained devices. This approach has been successfully applied to graph neural networks (GNNs), harnessing their expressive capabilities to generate node embeddings that capture structural and feature-related information. In this study, we depart from the conventional KD approach by exploring the potential of collaborative learning among GNNs. In the absence of a pre-trained teacher model, we show that relatively simple and shallow GNN architectures can synergetically learn efficient models capable of performing better during inference, particularly in tackling multiple tasks. We propose a collaborative learning framework where ensembles of student GNNs mutually teach each other throughout the training process. We introduce an adaptive logit weighting unit to facilitate efficient knowledge exchange among models and an entropy enhancement technique to improve mutual learning. These components dynamically empower the models to adapt their learning strategies during training, optimizing their performance for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets each for node and graph classification demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, a wide range of solutions have been proposed for the specific case of systematic relational reasoning, including Neuro-Symbolic approaches, variants of the Transformer architecture, and specialised Graph Neural Networks. However, existing benchmarks for systematic relational reasoning focus on an overly simplified setting, based on the assumption that reasoning can be reduced to composing relational paths. In fact, this assumption is hard-baked into the architecture of several recent models, leading to approaches that can perform well on existing benchmarks but are difficult to generalise to other settings. To support further progress in the field of systematic relational reasoning with neural networks, we introduce NoRA, a new benchmark which adds several levels of difficulty and requires models to go beyond path-based reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at NeurIPS 2025 D&B track</p></details> |

This work presents iPac, a novel approach to introduce a new graph representation of images to enhance graph neural network image classification by recognizing the importance of underlying structure and relationships in medical image classification. iPac integrates various stages, including patch partitioning, feature extraction, clustering, graph construction, and graph-based learning, into a unified network to advance graph neural network image classification. By capturing relevant features and organising them into clusters, we construct a meaningful graph representation that effectively encapsulates the semantics of the image. Experimental evaluation on diverse medical image datasets demonstrates the efficacy of iPac, exhibiting an average accuracy improvement of up to 5% over baseline methods. Our approach offers a versatile and generic solution for image classification, particularly in the realm of medical images, by leveraging the graph representation and accounting for the inherent structure and relationships among visual entities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the proceedings of ICONIP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Dual Prompting: Hierarchical Debiasing for Fairness-aware Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23469v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) through self-supervised learning on unlabeled graph data has emerged as a widely adopted paradigm in graph learning. Although the paradigm is effective for pre-training powerful GNN models, the objective gap often exists between pre-training and downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, graph prompting adapts pre-trained GNN models to specific downstream tasks with extra learnable prompts while keeping the pre-trained GNN models frozen. As recent graph prompting methods largely focus on enhancing model utility on downstream tasks, they often overlook fairness concerns when designing prompts for adaptation. In fact, pre-trained GNN models will produce discriminative node representations across demographic subgroups, as downstream graph data inherently contains biases in both node attributes and graph structures. To address this issue, we propose an Adaptive Dual Prompting (ADPrompt) framework that enhances fairness for adapting pre-trained GNN models to downstream tasks. To mitigate attribute bias, we design an Adaptive Feature Rectification module that learns customized attribute prompts to suppress sensitive information at the input layer, reducing bias at the source. Afterward, we propose an Adaptive Message Calibration module that generates structure prompts at each layer, which adjust the message from neighboring nodes to enable dynamic and soft calibration of the information flow. Finally, ADPrompt jointly optimizes the two prompting modules to adapt the pre-trained GNN while enhancing fairness. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets with four pre-training strategies to evaluate the performance of ADPrompt. The results demonstrate that our proposed ADPrompt outperforms seven baseline methods on node classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a MetaModel framework to aggregate predictions from a diverse set of leading ML models. We present a featurisation scheme for combining task-specific GNN-derived features with conventional molecular descriptors. We demonstrate that our framework outperforms the cutting-edge ChemProp model on all regression datasets tested and 6 of 9 classification datasets. We further show that including the GNN features derived from ChemProp boosts the ensemble model's performance on several datasets where it otherwise would have underperformed. We conclude that to achieve optimal performance across a wide set of problems, it is vital to combine general-purpose descriptors with task-specific learned features and use a diverse set of ML models to make the predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[HOPSE: Scalable Higher-Order Positional and Structural Encoder for Combinatorial Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15405v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven highly effective at modeling relational data, pairwise connections cannot fully capture multi-way relationships naturally present in complex real-world systems. In response to this, Topological Deep Learning (TDL) leverages more general combinatorial representations -- such as simplicial or cellular complexes -- to accommodate higher-order interactions. Existing TDL methods often extend GNNs through Higher-Order Message Passing (HOMP), but face critical \emph{scalability challenges} due to \textit{(i)} a combinatorial explosion of message-passing routes, and \textit{(ii)} significant complexity overhead from the propagation mechanism. This work presents HOPSE (Higher-Order Positional and Structural Encoder), an alternative method to solve tasks involving higher-order interactions \emph{without message passing}. Instead, HOPSE breaks \emph{arbitrary higher-order domains} into their neighborhood relationships using a Hasse graph decomposition. This method shows that decoupling the representation learning of neighborhood topology from that of attributes results in lower computational complexity, casting doubt on the need for HOMP. The experiments on molecular graph tasks and topological benchmarks show that HOPSE matches performance on traditional TDL datasets and outperforms HOMP methods on topological tasks, achieving up to $7\times$ speedups over HOMP-based models, opening a new path for scalable TDL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Transformation Invariant Geometric Deep Learning: An Initial Representation Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12345v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks have achieved great success in the last decade. When designing neural networks to handle the ubiquitous geometric data such as point clouds and graphs, it is critical that the model can maintain invariance towards various transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling. Most existing graph neural network (GNN) approaches can only maintain permutation-invariance, failing to guarantee invariance with respect to other transformations. Besides GNNs, other works design sophisticated transformation-invariant layers, which are computationally expensive and difficult to be extended. In this paper, we revisit why general neural networks cannot maintain transformation invariance. Our findings show that transformation-invariant and distance-preserving initial point representations are sufficient to achieve transformation invariance rather than needing sophisticated neural layer designs. Motivated by these findings, we propose Transformation Invariant Neural Networks (TinvNN), a straightforward and general plug-in for geometric data. Specifically, we realize transformation invariant and distance-preserving initial point representations by modifying multi-dimensional scaling and feed the representations into existing neural networks. We prove that TinvNN can strictly guarantee transformation invariance, being general and flexible enough to be combined with the existing neural networks. Extensive experimental results on point cloud analysis and combinatorial optimization demonstrate the effectiveness and general applicability of our method. We also extend our method into equivariance cases. Based on the results, we advocate that TinvNN should be considered as an essential baseline for further studies of transformation-invariant geometric deep learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages; accepted by IEEE TPAMI</p></details> |

We investigate the underappreciated potential of vision models for graph understanding, finding they achieve performance comparable to GNNs on established benchmarks while exhibiting distinctly different learning patterns. These divergent behaviors, combined with limitations of existing benchmarks that conflate domain features with topological understanding, motivate our introduction of GraphAbstract. This benchmark evaluates models' ability to perceive global graph properties as humans do: recognizing organizational archetypes, detecting symmetry, sensing connectivity strength, and identifying critical elements. Our results reveal that vision models significantly outperform GNNs on tasks requiring holistic structural understanding and maintain generalizability across varying graph scales, while GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with increasing graph size. This work demonstrates that vision models possess remarkable yet underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding, particularly for problems requiring global topological awareness and scale-invariant reasoning. These findings open new avenues to leverage this underappreciated potential for developing more effective graph foundation models for tasks dominated by holistic pattern recognition.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Cross-Lingual Sponsored Search via Dual-Encoder and Graph Neural Networks for Context-Aware Query Translation in Advertising Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22957v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-lingual sponsored search is crucial for global advertising platforms, where users from different language backgrounds interact with multilingual ads. Traditional machine translation methods often fail to capture query-specific contextual cues, leading to semantic ambiguities that negatively impact click-through rates (CTR) and conversion rates (CVR). To address this challenge, we propose AdGraphTrans, a novel dual-encoder framework enhanced with graph neural networks (GNNs) for context-aware query translation in advertising. Specifically, user queries and ad contents are independently encoded using multilingual Transformer-based encoders (mBERT/XLM-R), and contextual relations-such as co-clicked ads, user search sessions, and query-ad co-occurrence-are modeled as a heterogeneous graph. A graph attention network (GAT) is then applied to refine embeddings by leveraging semantic and behavioral context. These embeddings are aligned via contrastive learning to reduce translation ambiguity. Experiments conducted on a cross-lingual sponsored search dataset collected from Google Ads and Amazon Ads (EN-ZH, EN-ES, EN-FR pairs) demonstrate that AdGraphTrans significantly improves query translation quality, achieving a BLEU score of 38.9 and semantic similarity (cosine score) of 0.83, outperforming strong baselines such as mBERT and M2M-100. Moreover, in downstream ad retrieval tasks, AdGraphTrans yields +4.67% CTR and +1.72% CVR improvements over baseline methods. These results confirm that incorporating graph-based contextual signals with dual-encoder translation provides a robust solution for enhancing cross-lingual sponsored search in advertising platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid GNN-IZR Framework for Fast and Empirically Robust AC Power Flow Analysis in Radial Distribution Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04264v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Alternating Current Power Flow (ACPF) problem forces a trade-off between the speed of data-driven models and the reliability of analytical solvers. This paper introduces a hybrid framework that synergizes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with the Implicit Z-Bus Recursive (IZR) method, a robust, non-iterative solver for radial distribution networks. The framework employs a physics-informed GNN for rapid initial predictions and invokes the IZR solver as a failsafe for stressed cases identified by a two-stage trigger. A failure is defined as any solution with a maximum power mismatch exceeding 0.1 p.u., a significant operational deviation. On a challenging test set of 7,500 stressed scenarios for the IEEE 33-bus system, the GNN-only model failed on 13.11 % of cases. In contrast, the hybrid framework identified all potential failures, delegating them to the IZR solver to achieve a 0.00 % failure rate, empirically matching the 100 % success rate of the analytical solver on this specific test set. An expanded ablation study confirms that both physics-informed training and Z-bus sensitivity features are critical, collaboratively reducing the GNN's failure rate from 98.72 % (data-only) to 13.11 %. The hybrid approach demonstrates a pragmatic path to achieving the empirical reliability of an analytical solver while leveraging GNN speed, enabling a significant increase in the number of scenarios analyzable in near real-time.</p></details> |  |
| **[GTR-Mamba: Geometry-to-Tangent Routing for Hyperbolic POI Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22942v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a critical task in modern Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs), aiming to model the complex decision-making process of human mobility to provide personalized recommendations for a user's next check-in location. Existing POI recommendation models, predominantly based on Graph Neural Networks and sequential models, have been extensively studied. However, these models face a fundamental limitation: they struggle to simultaneously capture the inherent hierarchical structure of spatial choices and the dynamics and irregular shifts of user-specific temporal contexts. To overcome this limitation, we propose GTR-Mamba, a novel framework for cross-manifold conditioning and routing. GTR-Mamba leverages the distinct advantages of different mathematical spaces for different tasks: it models the static, tree-like preference hierarchies in hyperbolic geometry, while routing the dynamic sequence updates to a novel Mamba layer in the computationally stable and efficient Euclidean tangent space. This process is coordinated by a cross-manifold channel that fuses spatio-temporal information to explicitly steer the State Space Model (SSM), enabling flexible adaptation to contextual changes. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR-Mamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in next POI recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables, submitted to ICDE 2026</p></details> |
| **[Diffuse to Detect: A Generalizable Framework for Anomaly Detection with Diffusion Models Applications to UAVs and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22928v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in complex, high-dimensional data, such as UAV sensor readings, is essential for operational safety but challenging for existing methods due to their limited sensitivity, scalability, and inability to capture intricate dependencies. We propose the Diffuse to Detect (DTD) framework, a novel approach that innovatively adapts diffusion models for anomaly detection, diverging from their conventional use in generative tasks with high inference time. By comparison, DTD employs a single-step diffusion process to predict noise patterns, enabling rapid and precise identification of anomalies without reconstruction errors. This approach is grounded in robust theoretical foundations that link noise prediction to the data distribution's score function, ensuring reliable deviation detection. By integrating Graph Neural Networks to model sensor relationships as dynamic graphs, DTD effectively captures spatial (inter-sensor) and temporal anomalies. Its two-branch architecture, with parametric neural network-based energy scoring for scalability and nonparametric statistical methods for interpretability, provides flexible trade-offs between computational efficiency and transparency. Extensive evaluations on UAV sensor data, multivariate time series, and images demonstrate DTD's superior performance over existing methods, underscoring its generality across diverse data modalities. This versatility, combined with its adaptability, positions DTD as a transformative solution for safety-critical applications, including industrial monitoring and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policies over Poses: Reinforcement Learning based Distributed Pose-Graph Optimization for Multi-Robot SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22740v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the distributed pose-graph optimization (PGO) problem, which is fundamental in accurate trajectory estimation in multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Conventional iterative approaches linearize a highly non-convex optimization objective, requiring repeated solving of normal equations, which often converge to local minima and thus produce suboptimal estimates. We propose a scalable, outlier-robust distributed planar PGO framework using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). We cast distributed PGO as a partially observable Markov game defined on local pose-graphs, where each action refines a single edge's pose estimate. A graph partitioner decomposes the global pose graph, and each robot runs a recurrent edge-conditioned Graph Neural Network (GNN) encoder with adaptive edge-gating to denoise noisy edges. Robots sequentially refine poses through a hybrid policy that utilizes prior action memory and graph embeddings. After local graph correction, a consensus scheme reconciles inter-robot disagreements to produce a globally consistent estimate. Our extensive evaluations on a comprehensive suite of synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our learned MARL-based actors reduce the global objective by an average of 37.5% more than the state-of-the-art distributed PGO framework, while enhancing inference efficiency by at least 6X. We also demonstrate that actor replication allows a single learned policy to scale effortlessly to substantially larger robot teams without any retraining.

| **[Structural-Spectral Graph Convolution with Evidential Edge Learning for Hyperspectral Image Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09920v3)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering groups pixels into clusters without labeled data, which is an important yet challenging task. For large-scale HSIs, most methods rely on superpixel segmentation and perform superpixel-level clustering based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, existing GNNs cannot fully exploit the spectral information of the input HSI, and the inaccurate superpixel topological graph may lead to the confusion of different class semantics during information aggregation. To address these challenges, we first propose a structural-spectral graph convolutional operator (SSGCO) tailored for graph-structured HSI superpixels to improve their representation quality through the co-extraction of spatial and spectral features. Second, we propose an evidence-guided adaptive edge learning (EGAEL) module that adaptively predicts and refines edge weights in the superpixel topological graph. We integrate the proposed method into a contrastive learning framework to achieve clustering, where representation learning and clustering are simultaneously conducted. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves clustering accuracy by 2.61%, 6.06%, 4.96% and 3.15% over the best compared methods on four HSI datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/jhqi/SSGCO-EGAEL.</p></details> |  |
| **[If You Want to Be Robust, Be Wary of Initialization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22652v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a spectrum of graph-related tasks, however concerns persist regarding their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. While prevailing defense strategies focus primarily on pre-processing techniques and adaptive message-passing schemes, this study delves into an under-explored dimension: the impact of weight initialization and associated hyper-parameters, such as training epochs, on a model's robustness. We introduce a theoretical framework bridging the connection between initialization strategies and a network's resilience to adversarial perturbations. Our analysis reveals a direct relationship between initial weights, number of training epochs and the model's vulnerability, offering new insights into adversarial robustness beyond conventional defense mechanisms. While our primary focus is on GNNs, we extend our theoretical framework, providing a general upper-bound applicable to Deep Neural Networks. Extensive experiments, spanning diverse models and real-world datasets subjected to various adversarial attacks, validate our findings. We illustrate that selecting appropriate initialization not only ensures performance on clean datasets but also enhances model robustness against adversarial perturbations, with observed gaps of up to 50\% compared to alternative initialization approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Graph Classification Robustness with Singular Pooling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22643v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved strong performance across a range of graph representation learning tasks, yet their adversarial robustness in graph classification remains underexplored compared to node classification. While most existing defenses focus on the message-passing component, this work investigates the overlooked role of pooling operations in shaping robustness. We present a theoretical analysis of standard flat pooling methods (sum, average and max), deriving upper bounds on their adversarial risk and identifying their vulnerabilities under different attack scenarios and graph structures. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textit{Robust Singular Pooling (RS-Pool)}, a novel pooling strategy that leverages the dominant singular vector of the node embedding matrix to construct a robust graph-level representation. We theoretically investigate the robustness of RS-Pool and interpret the resulting bound leading to improved understanding of our proposed pooling operator. While our analysis centers on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), RS-Pool is model-agnostic and can be implemented efficiently via power iteration. Empirical results on real-world benchmarks show that RS-Pool provides better robustness than the considered pooling methods when subject to state-of-the-art adversarial attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.
